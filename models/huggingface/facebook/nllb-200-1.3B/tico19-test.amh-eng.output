From January 1-March 15, 2020, the overall incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was growing rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area.
The overall incidence rate of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is showing similar trends in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, indicating that the global COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in all countries, despite varying levels of detection by country.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase preparedness in anticipation of a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, especially intensive care.
December 31, 2019, cases of unknown cause of sambas were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the cause was a novel coronavirus agent, known as severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date shows that 80% of COVID-19 patients have mild respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most recover.
In 14% of cancer cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe form requiring hospitalization, and the remaining 6% of cases develop a severe disease requiring intensive medical attention.
4% of hospitalized patients died from COVID-19.
In this study, we assess the overall incidence trend of COVID-19 in each EU/European Economic Area country and the United Kingdom (UK) compared to Hubei Province in China.
We have now compared the number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK with the number in Italy from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK
COVID-19 has spread from China to more geographic regions, and the current global outbreak of COVID-19 is following the country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
Spiteri et al. report the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition, published in Eurosurveillance 2020 on March 5.
In the European Union/European Economic Area, France reported the first three confirmed cases on January 24, 2020, with the people coming from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths recorded between 31 December 2020 and that date, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths were reported in Italy alone.
Knowing the total number of cases and the overall incidence of COVID-19
The data on COVID-19 case numbers in each country of the world reported by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is only available from official sources such as the country's Ministry of Health HQs, national and regional health authorities and WHO, which is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to gauge COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK and to compare with Italy.
As the presence of active COVID-19 cases is representative, we have calculated the total incidence of COVID-19 cases to be 14 days, taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
In addition, we have compared the number of cases reported in each country as of March 15, 2020 at 8:00 a.m. with the situation in Italy from January 31-March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK
The trend of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK over the 14 day total event period was followed by the Hubei Province (China) as a whole (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the overall incidence of COVID-19 began to rise around 21 February and then peaked around 28 February 2020 (guidance material).
This was largely due to the rapid increase in cases reported from Italy, but other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar upward trends in the cumulative COVID-19 incidence (Help material).
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to the number in Italy from January 31-March 15, 2020.
As of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported a total number of cases that is comparable to Italy's 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results show that the number of reported COVID-19 cases has increased rapidly in the EU/European Economic Area and the UK.
Trends in the overall incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the global pandemic is increasing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, there are differences in national public health responses, and there are different case definitions and protocols in different countries to select patients who may need to be screened for COVID-19.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian states reported that 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive medical care, and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these states were reaching capacity.
Data on COVID-19 cases treated in hospitals and/or intensive care units are currently available for only 6% and 1% of cases at EU/EEA level respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be collected systematically to strengthen up-to-date monitoring data on reported cases and deaths.
A 2010-11 study showed a wide disparity between the number of ready-made intensive care beds and standard beds in Europe, from 29.2 per 100,000 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less reserves than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 people, 201011).
Modelling conditions related to health support capacity integration with more than 90 critical patient beds is presented in the sixth ECDC updated COVID-19 assessment of the estimated number of COVID cases spread in hostels for each EU/EEA country and UK.
As there are cluster cases in the EU/EEA and UK and hospitals and intensive care units are often targeted to a specific population, the data on cases and intensive care beds should be disclosed at NUTS-2 level.
Experience from Italy and other trends in other countries show that the global COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly spreading across the EU/European Economic Area and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared with the knowledge that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to spread in communities and increase the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, especially intensive care, as demonstrated by the situation in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in a recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid and comprehensive approach to slowing the spread of SARS-COV-2 is critical, shifting from containment to mitigation approaches, because the expected rapid increase in the number of cases if not implemented early does not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response.
Rapid risk assessment is a limitation of community health measures, which is intended to mitigate the impact of the global pandemic.
The window of opportunity for countries to further increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on health care is short.
Otherwise, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will be flooded with patients requiring medical attention in the coming days or weeks.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has already infected more than 80,000 people in China and the rest of the world, killing more than 3,000, and has become a pandemic for humanity.
Similar to the SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of deaths in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by night owls and cause similar symptoms in the same way.
However, COVID-19 has a lower prevalence and mortality rate than SARS, but the prevalence is higher and it affects older men and women more than young people.
As the number of papers published on the new phenomenon is increasing rapidly, this article attempts to provide an up-to-date and comprehensive survey of the rapidly growing research project.
We cover the basics of the disease epidemiology, etiology, virology, detection, treatment and prevention.
Although many questions still need to be answered, we hope this survey will help understand and prevent the threat of disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020, was a historic event for all Chinese as the new virus-borne disease warned Chinese to stay indoors during and after the festival.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused severe respiratory syndrome in 2003, so on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2, and the related disease was named COVID-19.
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country to nearly 50 countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the number of reported cases of COVID-19 virus was over 80,000, with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospital, and more than 3,000 deaths.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the number one public enemy and has the potential to do more harm than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report was released on January 7, 2020, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, including virology, epidemiology, etiology, pathology and treatment, which have determined the sequence of viruses isolated from different patients.
This survey attempts to summarize the results of the research into a new and rapidly evolving topic of study.
Where possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and another COVID-related disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, 2012 outbreak).
we will discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and history of the disease, as well as some remaining but urgent questions.
CoVs are generally considered non-fatal pathogens in humans, and are the primary cause of about 15% of influenza 4.
However, we have encountered two disease-causing giant CoVs in this century (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), first in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and then quickly spreading to many other countries, causing alarming rates of illness and death.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third recorded CoV outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure 1, cases of unknown origin of sambas were first reported to the China National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31/2019.
Seven days later, the COVID test was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death was recorded in water.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, states and countries.
On January 20, health care providers reported cases of the virus, indicating human-to-human transmission.
On january 23, all public transportation in the city of wuhan was stopped and the entire city was closed.
An initial clinical study of the disease on January 24 showed that of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the aquarium, where the animal source was not known as the source of infection.
On January 30, the WHO declared the pandemic an urgent global health threat.
At the time of writing this report, the disease had spread to China and nearly 50 other countries (Figure 2).
As the situation is changing rapidly, the final extent and severity of the pandemic will be determined in the future.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-center study was conducted on 8,866 patients, of whom 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients were showing the latest outbreak status (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
Although SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, it primarily affects those aged 30-65.
Half (47.7%) of the infected individuals are over 50 years old, with a very small number under 20, and only 14 infected individuals are under 10 years old.
The number of men (0.31/100,000) infected with SARS-CoV-2 is higher than that of women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 is mainly spread in and around Hubei.
It takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from the date of infection to test positive for COVID-19.
The average time for the onset of symptoms in an infected person is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), with the adjusted R0 being 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases rose sharply before 23 January 2020, the transit period associated with the Spring Festival in China.
The death rate for patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted death rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of broad-band viruses containing one class of RNA.
They can be divided into four broad categories: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which both alpha and beta CoVs are known to infect humans.
Envelope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the cellular receptor antigensine-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and then tissue fusion is formed.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is sequenced, the genomic RNA and envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins form a cell- or extracellular structure containing the virus, which combines with the plasma tissue to release the virus.
The first case of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
When SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new type of beta-CoV, more than 99.98% of the 10 samples taken from the Hunan seafood market in the waters where the outbreak first broke out were found to be genetically identical.
The SARS-CoV-2 gene is more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, microscopic particles of SARS-CoV-2 have been detected in the thinnest parts of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein in SARS-CoV-2 has weakened binding to human ACE2 from SARS-CoV, which is related to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients are less severe than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is secreted by the novel short protein orf3b and released by the orf8 protein.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in the pathogenesis of the virus and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 has no known functional domain or cause.
On February 18, 2020, Zoo and colleagues reported that the full length cryoEM structure of human ACE2 is 2.9 Å resolution, which is from the amino acid transporter B0AT1 complex.
They found that the open and closed complexes are dimer-like and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complexes can bind to two S proteins, which provide evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug testing to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and distribution host
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are believed to have originated from nocturnal birds and were transmitted to humans through mice and camels, respectively.
Through comparison of the genome of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were thought to be the primary hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus was 96% similar to two SARS-like CoVs extracted from bats, bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate carrier that allowed the virus to cross species boundaries and infect humans is not yet known, and its route is yet to be clarified.
G and colleagues suggested that the virus was transmitted from night owls to humans by snakes, which requires recombination with S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, long-nosed, ant-eating pangolins, mammals commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, are SARS-CoV-2 intermediate hosts, based on a 99% genetic match between the CoV found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference in the distribution of both genomes is itself a large difference, and therefore, concrete results are expected for the proof (Fig. 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet widely known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in dry conditions for up to 48 hours and at temperatures below 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity for up to 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and temperatures at 56°C to 30°C. Ether, 75% ethanol, chlorinated antibacterial, paracetic acid, chloroform and other lubricating solvents, including chloroxide, are effective in debilitating the virus.
The general population is vulnerable to the new virus because of poor immunity to SARS-CoV-2.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported on the immune response to the foreign invader virus SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other covov, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, a virus is first recognized after it has infected a host by pattern-marking receptors (PRRs) that act on the host's immune system, including C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
The virus uses a variety of pathways to inhibit the spread of the virus, such as inflammation of body organs, the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) to cause antigen-preserving cells to cook, and the acceleration of viral antigen macrophage phagocytosis.
However, the SARS-CoV N protein may help the virus escape the immune system.
Soon, the targeted immune response will join the process of fighting the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play a vital role in the immune response.
While CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, CD8+ T cells directly kill the infected cells.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to aid the immune system.
However, CoVs can inhibit T cell function by accelerating T cell death.
Fluid-based immunizations such as C3a and C5a and antibodies are also important in preventing viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient rendered MERS-CoV ineffective.
On the other hand, when the immune system overreacts, it produces large amounts of free radicals, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, can cause the death of various organs.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is more likely to affect elderly and pregnant women with various diseases.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is weakened to be more likely to contract the virus than others.
The estimated mean incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, with the most frequent incubation period being 3-7 days, according to studies of the first 425 cases in water.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and the average incubation period was 0-24 days.
As mentioned above, the most recent study showed a reproductive life of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days, based on population data of 8,866 cases.
health officials will need to adjust effective quarantine times based on the most accurate breeding time, thus preventing those who are infected but do not show symptoms from passing the virus on to others.
As a common practice, individuals who are exposed to or infected with the virus usually need to be quarantined for up to 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The primary and primary symptom of COVID-19 is fever, which may be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting.
some patients have experienced shortness of breath and/or low blood oxygen levels since the day of onset.
In severe cases, patients may develop severe respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy early.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever should be tested for the virus early, even if they do not have problems with lung imaging.
A demographic survey conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of cases of seizures was 98% for burning, 76% for dry cough, 55% for shortness of breath and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required respiratory support.
Recent studies have also recorded similar findings in two family groups and a group of individuals infected with the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic survey showed that fever (98%) dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) were the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients.
However, 80% more COVID-19 patients require respirators than others, given the higher mortality rate of MERS than COVID-19.
Measles (26%) and throat ulcers (21%) were also seen in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms; 14%-20% of patients needed respiratory assistance.
On February 14, the COVID-19 death rate was 2%, and the number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
In comparison, the death rate from SARS was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases as of November 2002.
According to a demographic survey conducted in June 2012, the death rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A preliminary study showed that SARS-CoV-2 R0 was high at 6.47, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, and SARS-CoV R0 was between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV based on the characteristics, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less lethal than the latter.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is more challenging than controlling MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Group infections often occur within the same family or in the same group or in a vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually had a history of travel or residence in water or other infected areas within two weeks of the outbreak, or had direct contact with individuals or patients with the virus.
However, reports that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without showing symptoms and that patients who have survived and been discharged from hospital may also carry the virus again are a warning to extend the quarantine period.
In the early stages of the disease, patients have a normal or lower white blood cell count (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphonia with white blood cell count; 4×109/L; including lymphocyte count; 1×109/L elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia 1,099 were found in COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had increased levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation increased in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the levels of D-dimer, a fiber-reducing product, in the blood increase, and the number of immune white blood cells gradually decreases.
In most COVID-19 patients, chest radiography results showed health problems, with the profile being either side-locked or blurred portions in the lungs.
Patients often have regular pneumonia, severe lung damage, and severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In ARDS, uncontrolled swelling, fluid retention, and a growing wound cause severe problems with gas exchange.
Type I and type II alveoli reduce lipid and protein synthesis, increasing stress, causing the lungs to become dissolved and increasing the risk of lung blockage.
Therefore, the worst chest X-ray findings are usually associated with the most severe dose of the disease.
The February 18, 2020 initial epidemiological analysis of COVID-19 showed the presence of neural damage, haemoglobin tissue formation, lung entrapment and lung cells from infected patients, consistent with the viral infection and ARDS epidemiological studies and similar to those of SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by a laboratory technique called reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has served as a critical criterion for the detection of COVID-19.
However, due to the increasing number of false negatives, which can accelerate the outbreak, clinical laboratory tests (which no longer rely solely on RT-PCR) were introduced in China on February 13, 2020.
The same thing happened with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the combination of medical history, clinical evidence, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential to an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang Group developed a protocol for detecting SARS-CoV-2 by screening using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique, which uses a dipstick to detect synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA particles at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies at microliter input) in less than an hour without additional equipment.
If the new technique can be proven in clinical samples, we hope it can significantly increase sensitivity and comfort.
Due to the lack of experience with novel CoVs, doctors may provide COVID-19 primarily as supportive care, and also test different therapies that have been previously used or considered to treat other covers and other viral infections, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Table (Table 2.2).
These therapies include antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma, Chinese medicine, and psychosocial support.
plasma from recovered patients has been suggested for treatment.
pharmaceutical companies are rushing to produce antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the lungs, with smaller amounts affecting other body organs such as the digestive system and kidneys, which produce ACE2.
however, respiratory failure and dysfunction are the leading risk factors and the leading causes of death among patients.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives, including general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and intramuscular ventilation, and mechanical ventilation, depending on the weight of the patient.
patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be assisted with extracorporeal tissue oxygenation (ECMO), an advanced cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat life-threatening cardiac or respiratory arrhythmias.
In addition, electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and septic shock, and maintenance of critical organ function are critical for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
The cause of cytokine storm is known to be an over-action of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storms are characterized by a systematic anti-inflammatory response and the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause the host cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which cause ARDS and various body parts to stop working.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
The IL6 monoclonal antibodies cortisone and tosilezumab have been used to treat cytotoxicity.
Other treatments for cytokine storm include stimulation of T cell targeted immune response; inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumab; cytokine signaling agonist 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
steroids are widely used for the treatment of sars in order to reduce the damage to the human immune system.
However, high-dose steroids are not very helpful in alleviating severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, it can severely affect prognosis of disease progression, with severe side effects, especially bone tissue death.
However, low to moderate short-term corticosteroid doses are recommended for patients with severe COVID-19.
At the time of writing, the existence of effective antiviral therapy has not yet been established.
However, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir administered via a blood transfusion showed efficacy in one US COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead, originally designed to treat infections caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir was shown to inhibit the activity of single RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Accordingly, Gilead Group has delivered the compound to China for combined testing on SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, with results eagerly awaited.
additionally, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been proposed for use as therapeutics in patients with severe respiratory distress.
Nausea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions may occur as a result of lopinavir/ritonavir combination therapy.
The interaction between these treatments and other medications used on patients should be carefully monitored.
Production of plasma and antibodies from recovered patients
blood transfusions from people recovering from infectious diseases have a long history of being used to treat people with the same disease or to prevent infection in healthy individuals.
of course, recovered patients have higher levels of antibodies to the pathogen in their blood.
Anbodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes that fight pathogens and other foreign substances, as well as directly neutralize them by identifying specific molecules in the pathogens.
Accordingly, plasma was taken from the blood of patients recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral pressure, as well as improved oxygen absorption in the blood.
However, testing and testing are needed to suggest a method for widespread use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, some plasma-related injuries should be carefully monitored, given the effects of the treatment.
for example, antibodies can inhibit the immune response and cause life-threatening cytokine-acid syndrome.
the amount of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the need for plasma to treat terminally ill patients is high.
It is difficult to quickly develop and manufacture specific antibodies that are capable of fighting a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is necessary to identify the genetic codes needed to isolate B cells from recovered patients and produce effective antibodies or to screen critical virus proteins for effective antibodies.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China to treat a variety of diseases for thousands of years.
However, the results are primarily based on the combination of different components in a formula, which varies according to the TCM care and the severity of the disease.
Most of the effective components remained unknown or obscure, because it was difficult to identify and verify such components or their composition.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or recovering from severe disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du pills and Lian Hua Qing Wen pills have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
In several provinces in China, where TCM was used in 87% of patients, the survival rate for COVID-19 patients was high, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%).
However, this comparison is not exhaustive, since many other factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, are not included in the estimate.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) therapy alone with WM and TCM combination therapy.
They found that the time required for body temperature to recover, the time required for symptoms to disappear, and the time required for hospitalization were significantly reduced in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM-only group.
More surprisingly, the rate of disease exacerbation (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (7.4% versus 46.2%); and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of TCM will depend on the results of larger-scale, more controlled trials in more centers.
It is also of great interest to explain the complexity of the procedures and to explain the effective components or, if possible, their combination of TCM treatments.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 may be extremely fearful of the highly contagious and possibly fatal disease, and those in isolation may feel lonely, isolated, and angry.
In addition, the negative effects of infections and treatments, such as fever, shortness of breath, and cough, such as cortisone-induced insomnia, can increase the risk of mental disorders and depression.
In the early stages of the SARS epidemic, a variety of mental health disorders have been reported, including persistent seizures, anxiety, panic attacks, delusions, psychiatric symptoms, seizures, and suicidal ideation.
Mandatory contact monitoring and quarantine, one of the community health responses to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks, can create feelings of anxiety and guilt for people affected by the outbreak, the effects of isolation, and the isolation from family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care is provided for COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals, and those who have come into contact with them and need it in general.
Psychosocial support should include the establishment of multi-sectoral mental health groups, the transparent and timely communication of information about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid contact.
effective vaccines are essential to break the chain of transmission from animal reservoirs and infected humans to vulnerable hosts, and effective antiviral therapy is helpful to control outbreaks caused by new viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines that can provide antibodies and/or a sustained boost to the immune system in the context of SARS-CoV.
Vaccines made from pathogenic viruses have been tested in animal models for SARS.
However, the efficacy of these candidate vaccines in elderly people and in animal-transmitted virus control models is yet to be determined before clinical trials are initiated.
This may be because SARS declined 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, in the Middle East, the prevalence of MERS continues to increase dramatically, with the prevalence of animal-to-human transmission in existing areas spreading to other regions.
Immune viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like substances, and lab-derived protein subunits have been developed for MERS vaccination strategies, some of which have been tested on animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 protection for immunocompromised individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, the long time required to produce the vaccine (average 18 months) and the variable nature of CoVs make it challenging to deal with the problem.
As COVID-19 is a new disease, the full clinical process is just beginning to be demonstrated in thousands of patients.
in most cases, patients recover gradually without detriment to their health.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 causes severe illness and death in people who are seriously ill.
Therefore, it is critical to develop a prognostic model for this disease so that health care agencies can streamline their services, especially in areas with scarce resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following may be relevant or related to the medical history of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age has been a crucial factor in determining the history of SARS, and this is also true for COVID-19.
As mentioned above, according to a study of 8,866 cases, 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age had COVID-19 mainly in the 30-65 age group.
The fact that patients requiring intensive medical attention are older (average age 66 versus 51) than those with pre-existing illnesses and health problems suggests that age is a factor in estimating the chances of recovery for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As noted above, SARS-CoV-2 is more prevalent in males than females (0.31/100,000 males, 0.27/100,000 females).
Recurrent health problems and illnesses: COVID-19 patients who require intensive medical attention are more likely to develop severe heart disease and respiratory problems.
heart disease-related complications are the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes and may cause liver health problems in COVID-19 patients.
it is important to recognize that age and pre-existing disease are highly correlated and that one can interfere with the other.
Unhealthy laboratory findings: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood is a reflection of the extent of inflammation or tissue damage, and has been suggested as a tool for determining the natural history of disease, response to therapy, and ultimate recovery.
The relationship between CRP levels and predictions of COVID-19 severity and progression has also been suggested.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may help predict the outcome.
these enzymes are highly expressed in various body parts, especially in the heart and liver, and are released when tissue damage occurs.
Thus, heart or liver problems are common indicators.
The main clinical symptoms: chest radiography and prolongation of clinical symptoms, among other factors, can be used to predict the outcome of COVID-19 and health problems.
As described above, steroids are commonly used as an adjunct therapy for infectious diseases that suppress the human immune system and reduce damage to the respiratory system.
The widespread use of high doses of corticosteroids in patients with severe SARS has led to many survivors suffering bone death, permanent disability, and a lower standard of living.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for short duration in COVID-19 patients.
Depression: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients experience extreme anxiety and uncertainty due to prolonged isolation, seeing their close family members and other patients die.
psychological counseling and ongoing support are essential to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to current demographic studies, COVID-19 has different transmission characteristics from SARS.
In addition to reproducing in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also reproduces in the upper respiratory tract and shows no signs or symptoms at the early stage of infection, similar to other flu-causing CoVs.
Therefore, people infected with the virus may produce large amounts of the virus during the initial phase or the incubation period due to their daily activities, making it extremely difficult to control the outbreak.
However, SARS-CoV has been shown to be transmitted when patients are severely ill and most transmission is not occurring in the early stages of the disease.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Major efforts are underway in China to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2, including complete restrictions on movement and quarantining of the general population in Wuhan and surrounding cities.
While these measures are seriously damaging the economy and other sectors of the country, the decline in the number of new cases is a sign of the pandemic's slowdown.
The most optimistic estimate is that the pandemic will end in March and the transmission rate will decrease in 3-4 months.
other experts, however, are less forthcoming.
According to Paul Hunter, COVID-19, which appears to be more infectious than SARS, will not end by 2020.
The researchers, along with Ira Longini, developed a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in nasal and throat samples taken from patients who had recovered from the hospital two weeks earlier, suggesting that the recently identified virus, like influenza, may be recurrent.
However, with the declining number of new cases, there are promising signs in China, indicating that current strategies may not be effective.
Ebola was initially estimated to have killed half a million people, with up to a million cases.
However, due to strict quarantine and quarantine, the disease is under control.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may be weak and die in the process, or it may be a weak virus that coexists with humans and can transmit disease.
A comparison between the COVID-19 outbreak and SARS and MERS is shown below (Figure (Figure 55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is most commonly transmitted by coughing or sneezing, as well as by direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also found on the feces, suggesting the possibility of transmission from the feces to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases showed that 41% of cases were probably caused by a single infection, including 17 patients and 40 health care providers with pre-existing disease.
Therefore, extreme precautions should be taken to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, coworkers, and those who come into contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense we can use to reduce the risk of infection is face masks, surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (brand number 1860s) help to control the spread of the virus.
surgical face masks prevent droplets from infected individuals from traveling through the air or sticking to the surface of materials, thus preventing transmission to other people.
However, only N95 masks (identification number 1860s) are able to absorb viruses with sizes from 10 to 80 nm; only 5% of microviruses are fully absorbable by respiration; SARS-CoV-2 is somewhat similar to SARS-CoV, both at approximately 85 nm.
Five surgical masks are stacked on top of each other, but small objects can get in, so healthcare workers in direct contact with patients should not wear N95 (brand number 1860s) and surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare workers should wear self-made gowns to reduce contact with the virus.
viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor wearing an N95 mask tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, which may have entered his body through his swollen eye.
Therefore, healthcare providers should wear clearly visible face masks or masks when working with patients.
For the general population living in areas of infection or risk, it is recommended that everyone wash their hands more often than usual with soap, stay home alone, and limit contact with people who may be infected.
people should stay three feet away from patients.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a new virus to the human world, the high similarity to SARS-CoV reported on January 7, 2020, should have been a wake-up call due to the severe memory of the SARS epidemic China experienced in 2003.
However, the director of the Water Disease Control Center remained until January 19, 2020, reassuring the public by saying that the risk of human-to-human transmission of the new virus is low, the likelihood of reproduction is limited, and the disease is not difficult to prevent and control.
Especially as the entire country is preparing for the Spring Festival, this message has raised the level of public awareness to a critical level and has brought the disease to a critical point in controlling it while it is still at a low level in the water.
disease control organizations in china can learn from this difficult lesson and make robust reforms for the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more careful when making public statements because citizens can take every word seriously and change their opinions and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics than to formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) be more concerned with preventing outbreaks of an epidemic than with trying to comfort the public; and (4) launch more targeted and effective experiments to increase public awareness of pandemics and to test and improve the community response system in a timely manner.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it had spread throughout china, and at the time of writing, it had spread to some 50 countries.
As the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a feeling that SARS will recur.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are critical to controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older adults more than young people, men more than women, and the severity and mortality rates are also higher among older adults than young people.
The death rate from SARS is higher than from COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even without symptoms, whereas SARS patients usually transmit the virus during a period of severe illness, making the spread of COVID-19 more difficult to control than SARS.
This provides a partial explanation for why SARS-CoV-2 has spread so rapidly and widely from SARS-CoV.
A standard RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients may be positive for the virus again.
These findings significantly increase the risk of virus transmission.
As research on COVID-19 is progressing rapidly, several critical issues need to be addressed, such as:
where did sars-cov-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic similarity has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like nightshade CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from nightshade.
which animal species was the first to carry the virus, such as the nightingale, and the most dangerous in the process of transmitting it to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop the spread, and the pandemic can strike at any time.
Although the association of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 has been demonstrated by molecular modeling and biochemical testing, how does the virus enter the airway cells and cause disease?
Does the virus bind to ACE2 signaling cells in other parts of the body?
without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
how does the growth of the embryo show when the virus is transmitted from person to person?
will it be a global pandemic, like SARS, or will it be a pandemic like the flu?
searching for answers to these and many other questions is important, but it may take time.
However, no matter what the cost, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
The origin of human coronaviruses
mutation and adaptation is the millennial origin of the coronavirus and its carriers, including humans.
Before 2003, two human covts (HCoVs) were found to cause mild flu-like illness.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has shown that HCoV infection is potentially devastating and life threatening.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in late 2019 has caused the covid to take a new direction and has surprised us with its high transmissibility, however, compared to its peer SARS-CoV, its pathogenicity is lower.
as hcov is a zoonotic disease, understanding the zoonotic sources of hcov is of great benefit.
Many HCoVs originate from night owls, which are not pathogenic.
They are also known as the intermediate primary carriers of some echinoderms.
identifying a vector is directly related to human immunity.
Studying interactions between co-infection in animals may also provide valuable insight into the pathogenesis of co-infection in humans.
In this review, we provide information about the seven HCoVs, their history, and a summary of existing data, focusing on the main origins and interstellar transmissions.
Importantly, we have compared different HCoVs based on the virus's origin and genome reassortment.
The current outbreak of COVID-19 is discussed in this context.
In addition, the criteria for successful carrier exchanges and the biological implications of the virus on disease severity were also suggested.
The coronavirus is classified as a coronavirus, a group of viruses that includes both positive and single RNA viruses.
These viruses have the largest genome of RNA viruses, between 26 and 32 kilobytes, and are named by Zhukovch because their structure resembles a crown under an electron microscope.
In structure, there are genomes that share the same structure that the cows do not.
Approximately two-thirds of the virus strains contain two large open receptors (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are highly translated into pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are continuously processed to form 16 non-formal proteins, isolated nsp1~16.
The remaining components are ORFs, which are composed of spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleotide (N) for the proton structure.
Several transitional protein seed stem cells are also registered in different cove seed cells.
The difference in protein sequence means that transcoviruses are divided into four categories (alpha-coviruses, beta-coviruses, gamma-coviruses and delta-coviruses); of these, the beta-coviruses are divided into five subgenera (A, B, C and D), whereas the beta-coviruses are the most commonly found.
Species evidence suggests that nightshade and mouse larvae are the source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the primary reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, cows have repeatedly crossed the species boundary. Some have also become important pathogens in the population.
There are seven known human-inflicted HCoVs.
Among them are alpha-covs, known as HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The other five beta-covs are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU, severe respiratory illness coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory illness coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as a cold and/or a cold.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the more recent variant SARS-CoV-2 are the most common causes of disease, causing a relatively high number of patients to develop severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary symptoms following infection in the lower respiratory tract.
The first HCoV-229E sample, B814, was isolated from nasal fluid of influenza patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, extensive studies have found that both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the idea that HCoV infection is generally harmless until the SARS outbreak is confirmed is widely accepted.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was the deadliest in recent history, affecting more than 8,000 people, with 10% of those in the recession or worse.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory disease (MERS) epidemic has repeatedly spread to the Arab world and quickly spread to other parts of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), renamed as SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) series pandemic, which has infected more than 91,000 people and caused more than 3,120 deaths between March 3 and March 2020.
The world needs to prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as the alarm is sounding.
all seven echkovs are from night birds, mice, or pets.
Many data support that the origins of Echinococcus are from the nightingale, where viruses adapt well and do not cause disease, but they show significant genetic differences.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and around the world.
The study of the origin of the cows suggests a theme for understanding natural history, the underlying pressures and the limitations of species dispersal.
This could guide or facilitate the search for primary, intermediate and mammalian carriers of SARS-CoV-2 with important recommendations in preventing future transmission.
In this survey, we provide an overview of zoonotic origin, transmission between species, and the causes of HCoVs.
In particular, we should discuss and emphasize the topic of the related HCoVs, which, as they are more frequently transmitted in their natural habitat, weaken but become pathogenic after transmission to new carriers.
We also consider the evolutionary tendency of HCoVs, where increased pathogenicity is often accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The impact of the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 is also discussed in this context.
animal coven has been known since the late 1930's.
Before the first detection of HCoV-229E cell B814 in the nasal cavities of influenza patients, different co-infections were detected in various affected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven HCoVs have been discovered in the last decade.
The theme of the history of the Echkovich discovery is set out in a clearer order in Table 1.
The first HCoV-229E strain of upper respiratory infection was isolated from patients' respiratory tract in 1966, and then developed into WI-38 lung cell lines.
In patients infected with HCoV-229E, fever and cough, including headaches, sneezing, aching and sore throat, have been reported in 10 to 20% of cases.
Later in 1967, the spread of HCoV-OC43 was detected in a series of sequences in the mammalian body and brain.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 are similar to those of infections caused by HCoV-229E, which is not detectable at the level of symptoms, such as influenza A viruses and other respiratory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed and are widely distributed during the cold winter months.
The combined duration of the symptoms of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by two weeks of pain.
Based on a study on a volunteer, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed mild flu.
Very few immunocompromised patients have developed severe lower respiratory disease.
SARS, also known as the "non-communicable lung disease", is the first recorded human HCoV-caused epidemic in human history, and the third HCoV to be identified as the etiological cause.
The first SARS detection was in the Guangdong province of China in late 2002, according to European data.
The SARS outbreak has spread to several countries and continents, causing 8,096 victims and 774 deaths.
Each case is estimated to cause an increase in cases of moderate severity, except for those that spread rapidly, which is 4 to 7 days of reproductive viral stress, with the onset of the disease occurring on day 10 of the infection.
The initial symptoms of SARS-CoV patients are myalgic, headache, fever, feeling of tightness and coldness, and the later symptoms are shortness of breath, dizziness and respiratory distress.
Lymphonia (very low levels of lymphocytes in the blood), liver function tests, and elevated creatine kinase (an enzyme that is released from damaged muscle) are common laboratory abnormalities caused by SARS.
Alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophage have also been observed in SARS patients.
An average of 20-30% of patients require special treatment and a respirator.
In addition to the lower respiratory area, various organs, including the gastrointestinal area, the liver and kidneys may be affected by this complication, which is often associated with a dangerous cytotoxic storm, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a relative of the patient who had travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong for lung surgery.
Since then, enormous energy has been invested in HCov research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old infant in the Netherlands in late 2004.
first, it is widely spread among children, adults, and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Nasal discharge, eye itching, fever, and bronchitis are common for infections caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another study, conducted in the Netherlands, found a similar virus in a respiratory sample taken from the nose of an 8-month-old infant suffering from pneumonia.
Although it is most popular in the netherlands, it has spread worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to account for about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, with peak occurrence in winter, spring and early September.
HCoV-NL63: also known as croup, is associated with throat block.
That same year, a 71-year-old patient hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong was isolated from HCoV-HKU1.
In addition to community-acquired lung disease and throat disease, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with an increased risk of severe asthma.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide to cause mild respiratory illness.
All of these community-acquired HCoVs were designed to work well in humans, and are generally unlikely to cause high pathogenicity, although for unknown reasons, such as the risk of infectious HCoV-NL63 subtypes, a recent lower respiratory infection in China has been reported.
In general, these HCoVs become less lethal or pathogenic as they become more transmissible and persist among humans.
MERS-CoV was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 in a 60-year-old lung patient whose disease had mutated into a lung tumor and rendered his kidney inoperable.
Although most of the laboratory-confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, secondary cases have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia from recent contacts.
The second outbreak occurred under French control in South Korea in 2015, with 186 people arrested.
The results of the tests show that MERS is similar to SARS in that it becomes a progressive pneumonia.
unlike sars, many patients with mercer have had an additional complication of renal failure, making mercer the most distinctive of the hCoV-related diseases so far.
more than 30% of patients suffer from diseases of the stomach and intestines, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported, representing a 34.4% fatality rate, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses for children.
In mid to late December 2019, multiple cases of pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
According to the World Health Organization, the infection of the lower respiratory tract caused by the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has received urgent global attention and the disease has been named COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a mortality rate of 3.4%.
In Hubei, China, the death rate is 4.2%, and in the rest of the country, it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes dangerous respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which manifest in the form of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
some patients have been exposed to it.
pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms of illness and can quickly lead to aggravated respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to their 82% high nucleotide sequence similarity, they are genetically related and classified under different branches on the tree.
sars-cov-2 is less pathogenic than sars-cov and merce-cov, but more infectious.
There have been reports of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases, which may have contributed to the rapid spread of the disease worldwide.
Comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveals significant similarities and differences.
The first incidence and duration of eczema are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the characteristics of the other six HCoVs.
The severity or severity of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four human HCoVs (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has the most common characteristics, including non-specific, mild, or no symptoms during community-acquired HCoV infections.
On the other hand, although the ratios vary somewhat, the severity of COVID-19 is similar to that of SARS-CoV.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 shows surprising behavioural patterns in community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the spread of HIV in society.
In other words, it is not yet established that SARS-CoV-2 will decrease its transmission capacity after a period in humans, as it does with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2 similar to other HCoVs may be detected in the straw sample.
The role of SARS-CoV-2 in oral fisal transmission, as in SARS-CoV cases, should be clarified by future studies, at least in some cases.
There is a strong interest to see if the HCoVs cases spread in the community have a mutant nature of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including transmission, pathogenesis, and continued transmission after human transmission have a significant impact on the eventual fate of the spreading COVID-19.
All four community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
in another view, it may be true that humans are well adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both early HCoVs could be global pandemics.
The most severe human pathogens, HCoVs, and people with severe HCoV infections have been eliminated.
To make this happen, HCoVs provide a pool of targeted exchanges that counter the causes of sufficiently high levels of endogenous limitations in humans.
In this context, the chances of full human adaptation are greater as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues for a longer period of time and affects more people.
If well adapted, it is difficult to isolate or stop interpersonal relationships with other disease control measures.
For several years, four community-acquired co-occurrences have been reported in the population, causing a common cold in immunocompromised victims.
These viruses do not need a primary animal store.
In contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoVs are less adapted to humans and cannot be stopped from human to human transmission.
The possibility of persistence and reproduction in their pathogenic vectors and the possibility of spread in suspected human victims, especially through one or another medium and reproductive vector, needs to be sought.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-inherited HCoVs.
As it is spread in society, at least temporarily, HCoVs are highly contagious.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
whether it will adapt completely to humans and whether it will be transmitted to humans without a carrier or a transmitter remains to be seen.
before we discuss which animals the echinoderms come from, it is useful to discuss the evolutionary, natural, linkage, and profile characteristics of echinoderms.
If the ends share a high nucleotide sequence close to the original origin, the animal serves as an evolutionary carrier for HCoV.
A genetically transmitted virus is one that is highly integrated with humans and not spread widely.
In a similar fashion, a carrier of sediment will hold HCOV continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are carriers of the HCoV or the parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV enters a vector or transmitter in a new form before or during the introduction of the virus, it will not integrate well with the new vector and will often cause disease.
This carrier can serve as a zoonotic source for infecting humans and can play a role in making the virus spread faster, and transmitting it to humans to increase the rate of infection.
Unless it spreads in moderation in this temporary vector, hCoV may continue to be a devastating disease for the world's population.
On the contrary, HCoVs can also adapt to their medium carriers and cause long-term epidemics.
This is when the intermediate carrier is the natural storage carrier.
Epidemiological data showed a history of contact with animals associated with the primary SARS case.
The study suggests that animal strains are more similar to anti-SARS-CoV IgG than to the general population.
The parrot larva and raccoon dog were first found in a wildlife market with viruses that look very similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was registered after all the suspected infections were removed from the market.
However, cats were reported to be SARS-CoV-free before contact with the pet market, which was reported to be a median vector of SARS-CoV, rather than a natural vector of SARS-CoV.
As 80% of the different animals in the market in Ganganu contain anti-SARS-CoV antibiotics, the transmission and exacerbation of SARS-CoV can be excluded from the different mammal species.
These are non-transmitting carriers of SARS-CoV.
Species evidence suggests that nightshade and mouse larvae are the source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the primary reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
These night owls have been shown to have anti-SARS-CoV antibody and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other nightbird cows share 88-92% of the nucleotide sequence configuration with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the groundwork for a new theory of human pathogens in night birds.
Several SARS-like co-occurrences (SL-occurrences) have been identified in night owls, but with the exception of one WIV1 category, the living virus is isolated.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 has been described as a receptor for nocturnal, larval, and human ACE2 use.
Surprisingly, SARS patients are not able to transmit WIV1.
WIV1 is the most recent strain of SARS-CoV present in night owls, representing 95% of the nucleotide formula homologous.
Although there is a significant homological difference between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct origin virus of SARS-CoV and that night owls are not direct carriers of SARS-CoV.
The study of the virus strain brings MERS-CoV together in a mass to the same group as Bat-CoV-HKU4 and Nightbird-CoV-HKU5.
NightbirdCoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same reactive receptor dipeptidyl peptides 4 (DPP4) for virus entry.
RNA-based RNA polymerization of MERS-CoV sequences is transmitted through the genome to laboratory cows; it has occurred in Europe and Africa.
No live MERS-CoV has been found in wild night owls so far.
MERS-CoV and its close relative Bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, the nightingale may be a direct carrier of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that camels in Arabia have a different antibody, MERS-CoV, which is the same as camels in many African countries, if from the Middle East.
Live MERS-CoV, which is similar to the virus found in humans, differs from the nasal secretions of Arabian camels, which are more likely to be carriers and transmitters of MERS-CoV.
It should be noted that in laboratory research, camels vaccinated with MERS-CoV for testing have generally shown mild symptoms but high viral load.
The issue is that infected camels release the virus not only through the respiratory system but also through the fungus, which is the main route of transmission from night owls.
However, the source of the MERS disease that has been questioned so far is not the presence of the disease in camels before it was discovered, its transmission from humans to humans or the introduction of an unknown animal species.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of the nucleotide composition with the rat covid RTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are so distant that it is difficult to predict their relationship.
This means that in the future, no night owls will be near carriers of SARS-CoV-2 unless similar coves are found.
Perhaps, the animals that carried and transmitted SARS-CoV-2 were sold and killed in the Hunan seafood supermarket, and the many cases of COVID-19 origin are related to this, suggesting that it may not have been transmitted from animals to humans.
Recent studies on metagenomic analysis suggest that a few endangered mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may be carriers of SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoVs.
These novel pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% of the nucleotide formula imaging with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to ARTG13 at 90% in their nucleotide sequence.
SARS-CoV-2 -like viruses are classified into two subtypes in the pathogen category, one of which shares a 97.4% amino acid sequence identifier with SARS-CoV-2 receptor receptor (RBD).
Although the genome is larger than the initial sequence, in clear contrast, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 RBDs are distinct.
Previous studies on infected pangolins have found viral contents in lung samples, which were found to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used various assembly methods and manual editing to make a genome pre-sampled virus genome that is about 86.3% of its entire length.
We cannot deny that pangolins are a possible animal vector of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-related beta-CoVs, there is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 originates directly from pangolin.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is also less than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in night birds, pangolins and other mammals remains stable.
However, high homology sequence is found within RBDs and shared high genome-wide sequence imaging among SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13.
The high degree of similarity between pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related RBDs (receptor endpoints) in beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by a differently selected-deep-linked evolutionary change.
Counter-recommendation is for re-synthesis between pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in a third wildlife specimen.
The fusion is widely distributed among beta-covs as a force of change.
The decision is also based on the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic origin.
The detection of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 is being studied alongside the highly pathogenic HCoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that the two HCoVs, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, may have originated from the late-warf cows, and that the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 family viruses were found in mouse species.
The nightbird covid ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge covid) found in the North American three-colored nightbird showed close similarity to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is related to another night-bird covid found in Ghana and named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, while camels are considered the intermediate vector.
to clarify, our understanding of animal-derived echinoderms is clearly illustrated in figure 1 and table 2.
paleogenetic analysis has provided evidence of historical incidents of transmission of HCoVs to interstellar spacecraft.
In 1890, when HCoV-OC43 transmitted the pathogen from domestic animals to humans, an outbreak of respiratory disease was recorded.
The transmission of HCoV-229E between species is not well understood.
Bat alpha-CoVs that are very similar to HCoV-229E have been identified.
among them is alpaca alpha-cov.
Several sources support direct transmission of the virus from night owls to humans.
first, alpacas (long-necked, long-haired wild animals of south america) may have contact with night birds in a shared ecological space.
Instead, humans have had little contact with alpacas.
Second, the HCoV-229E-associated nightbird alpha-CoVs were different and not disease-causing in the nightbird, while the alpaca alpha-CoVs caused respiratory illness infections in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV was not detected in wild animals.
Therefore, we should not stop speculating that alpacas may have been exposed to HCoV-229E-associated alpha-CoV in humans.
In fact, the night birds are a direct source of viruses that are harmful to humans, including mad dog virus, ebola virus, nipah virus, and hendra virus.
it is therefore not surprising that night owls can transmit hcov-229e directly to humans.
Alternatively, night-bird alpha-covs, such as HCoV-229E gene pools, can carry viruses to humans, such as MERS-CoV, alpacas, and Arabian camels.
mercury-cov is transmitted from night-bird to camel to camel to human, so it can be a good example of a disease that is transmitted to a different species.
The evolution of MERS-CoV was first identified in night owls, and has been confirmed by a series of discoveries.
It is clear that the interspecies transmission and interspecies transmission of nocturnal birds creates multiple sets of viral vectors.
Long-term stay, large-scale gathering, close contact, and the ability of night birds to fly vigorously are favorable conditions for the spread of the virus.
Meers-Cove, on the other hand, has had camels for decades.
It is well suited for these camels, which have been converted from medium to permanent and natural storage carrying capacity.
MERS-CoV is moderately pathogenic and remains relatively unchanged in these animals.
The occasional human transmission is sudden and, unless the transmission can be controlled, people remain a risk-prone carrier for this MERS-CoV.
The share of camels in MERS-CoV transmission compared to the share of pangolins is unique in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
especially pangolin beta-covalents are highly toxic to pangolins.
They may be the ultimate vectors for beta-covs that interact with SARS-CoV-2, as the mosquito is in SARS-CoV cases.
The multiple possibilities of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 viruses from animals to humans need to be monitored in future studies and then in outpatient studies.
Night owls may be carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 related virus and the SARS-CoV-2-like virus.
human children may share the same ecological zone as night owls, feeding on animals or mining for coal.
Second, new infections from rapidly transmitting pangolin carriers and SARS-CoV-2 related viruses.
people contract the virus when they hunt and eat wild animals.
Many mammals, including pets, may be at risk for SARS-CoV-2.
Home and wildlife testing for antibodies is authorized.
Third: As described above, the process of re-infection and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in another third species in contact with night owls and pangolins.
The animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is still under investigation.
Unlike animal carriers, the three main causes of the virus are critical to the adaptation of cows across the host range.
First, the highest relative strength is measured in the RNA repeat.
Compared to other single-combination RNA viruses, the estimated rate of CVO mutations, based on the adaptation rate of CVO for novel carriers, can be classified from medium to high with an average rate of substitution of ~10-4 per year, everywhere 2.
Cloves have a confirmation-reading exorbibolicis, the loss of which results in extreme behavioral change and stagnation or failure to continue.
Interestingly, remdesivir's nucleotide analogues are known to suppress C.O.V. replication by maintaining this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymers.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents being studied in clinical trials.
however, the reproductive capacity of the cows is millions times greater than that of their carrier.
In addition, when cows do not adapt well to the host, the rate of mutation is usually high.
Compared to SARS-CoV-2 with a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 strain transmission, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 strain transmission is clearly lower, indicating a higher degree of adaptation to humans.
possibly, if it is close to humans, it may already be adapted to another vector.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it also affects MERS-CoV, which is adapted to single-tailed camels.
In humans, the genetic drift vaccine and antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 is not rapidly successful.
Second, the extensive RNA genome in cows releases more plasticity in the evolution of the genome through behavioural change and recombination, thereby increasing the chance of co-evolution for subspecies and creating a conducive environment for novel coronavirus to occur when conditions are favorable.
This is supported by several distinct clear reading frameworks and protein functions that are targeted for entry into the 3′ end of the genome.
"Third, when covid RNA is replicated, it replicates and changes itself suddenly and repeatedly in a special ""copy-selection"" method".
In a carrier that is used as a mixer, the jumps are frequently performed during the replication of COVID RNA.
The highly identical full length and subgenomic RNAs are reassembled to form new CVO.
Natural recombination phylogenetic matrix HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 were found in both the animal coven bats SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
The virus is transmitted by contact with a virus-carrying person.
Alongside the above three viral factors, the interaction with the virus is another important and influential factor in the transmission of the virus from the host species.
The SARS-CoV reintegration is taken as an example, showing evidence of positive selection during intra-species events.
Based on comparative analysis, the single SARS-CoV, between humans and mice, achieves rapid adaptation to a variety of carriers, especially in S protein RBD exchanges.
RBD, which is generally found in the COVID S protein, binds to the cellular receptor and is the most widely selected antibody response antagonist.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in the S1 subunit of the 318th to 510th amino acid, which binds to the human ACE2 viral entry receptor.
The SARS-CoV RBD (Relative Edge Receptor) has the ability to detect ACE2 receptors in animals including night owls, bats, mice and raccoon dogs, allowing the virus to be transmitted across species.
Also, 6 amino acid sequences have been identified that are distinct from human and rodent virus and 4 of those that are translocated to ACE2 receptor are in receptor-adhesive mode.
Civet has K479 and S487T exchanges in SARS-CoV RBD (receptor endpoint) and increased binding of the prey protein in human ACC2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid mutations may be crucial for the virus to be able to adapt to humans.
The fact that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted in the same cells as SARS-CoV is of particular interest.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 may stop the S protein, which exhibits S protein in the S1 unit, from binding tightly to the ACE2 of the serum.
In fact, the CRIO-EM study indicates that this compound has a 10- to 20-fold higher affinity for ACE2 than for the human SARS-CoV S protein.
It is necessary to determine whether or not any other major receptor is needed for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 binds to ACE2 but is not with another S-body.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
After transferring to the genome from the host animals, they play a major role in the successful adaptation of these cows to humans.
In addition to cellular receptors, the effect of HCoVs on the distribution is also influenced by other vector agents and other factors.
The separation of these carrier proteins between humans and their natural primary carrier, such as nocturnal birds, unicorns, and long-faced mice, may create a limit to interspecies transmission.
Echinoderms must replace host-dependence issues and replicate host barriers to have a successful cross-species distribution.
They are the ones that determine, differentiate, and characterise the molecules around the viral carrier linkage that is crucial in this regard.
The use of state-of-the-art CRISPR technology to detect the genome-wide prevalence and limiting causes of non-communicable SARS-CoV-2 carriers may be useful.
The rise of Novel Hskovch: Back to the roots
The diversity of nocturnal birds creates a high probability of the occurrence of novel covoes.
in this case, nightbird cows serve as the breeding grounds for echinoderms.
Rapid mutation and gene recombination also determine the HCoV process and serve as two steps in the process.
for example, identifying novel protein cells has the potential to alter the virus.
Among SARS-CoV utility proteins, ORF8 has been found to be important in human adaptation, although it has been isolated from SARS-CoV-related nocturnal birds to introduce different ORF8 proteins.
The loss of the SARS-CoV-29-nucleotide characteristic was detected in isolated studies during the early human epidemic.
This cancellation creates an adapted reproduction by splitting ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a historical relationship with gamma-CoVs and gamma-CoVs, because microorganisms are present in RNA-dependent RNA-polymeres.
Re-integration sites have also been observed in nsp9, most nsp10, and nsp14 cells.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV outbreak in a Saudi Arabian monkey showed re-combination events between different strains.
Re-combination events have been observed in other HCoVs, in parallel with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in which HCoVs re-combine their shapeless genes with those of another animal.
Human-induced transmission, especially in the form of a strong carrier immune system, can lead to unexpected mutations in the virus strain, which may be caused by selective stresses from isolation.
One example of such damage is the reduction of the full length of ORF4 by the HCoV-229E prototype, which means the loss of two nucleotides.
ORAF4 was identified in HCoV-229E-associated nightbird and camel viruses, indicating single nucleotide introduction of alpaca alpha-CoV due to a change in coverage.
Finally, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by selective pressure in storage carriers.
night owls attack cows with little or no sign of harmony, which is a sign of harmony between the night owls and the cows.
Night owls have been shown to be structurally and physically adapted to covids.
For example, the nighttime bird's nesting reduces the production of chicks, as they cannot show the symptoms of the disease before they become ill.
On the other hand, the most important sign of histocompatibility in complex stage I molecules is low levels of the naturally-killing cell receptor NKG2/CD94, which is stressed by the natural killer cell functions in night owls.
In addition, elevated metabolic activity of nocturnal birds due to the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the testes may cause stress on the reproduction of eggs or impair re-reading by exoribonucleases, thus reducing the selective pressure for the generation of the virus, which can cause severe disease when it enters the avian vector.
Additional pathogenic COVID strains may also grow by fusion, leading to the discovery of new proteins or protein markers for the carrier to adapt.
So, it is not a coincidence that the three novel HCs have occurred in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their primary carriers, such as night birds and camels.
they also starve without developing a strong immune response.
The mystery of why asymptomatic carriers appear and why they cause serious cases of infection in humans is further explained.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by high levels of cytokine in the area of the immune response, where the immune response is highly active and strong, and the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, immuno-response among the signaling carriers was lower than in the COVID multiple.
The same approach to release of immune response binding may have beneficial effects for anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in night owls.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon should be useful, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, the initiation of NLRP3 inflammasome is absent in night owls.
In this hypothesis, the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor can be used in combination with MCC950 to treat COVID-19.
The origin of SARS-CoV-2 is followed by the overall outbreak of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
A beta-CoVs nightbird was found to be SARS-CoV-positive and share 95% nucleotide composition, while a SARS-CoV-2 nightbird was found to be 96% nucleotide-positive.
But marketed rodents and other animals have been found to have a SARS-CoV-like virus, and no close contacts of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs have been found to be remarkably homologous to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the closest possible relatives of the pangolin carriers, or pangolin beta-CoVs, may eventually absorb the SARS-CoV-2 type gene residues.
Despite the questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was thought to be accidentally man-made.
Covex has returned to the spotlight following the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of HCoVs in nocturnal birds and other animals has significantly changed our understanding of the origins of HCoV pathogenicity and the importance of animal vectors in human transmission.
There is strong evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate carriers.
sars-cov infection is caused by human and mosquito contact in the marketplace, and if the markets were closed and mosquitoes were killed, the sars-cov epidemic would have been stopped.
In the same logic, given the presence of several strains of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic (pathogenic) transmission.
However, whether or how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans via pangolins and other animals remains to be determined in future studies.
on the other hand, mercury-covid was found in a camel's body for a long time.
These camels are used for transportation, meat, milk, wool and leather products for the local community.
They are widely distributed from the middle east to africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to sacrifice all camels to prevent Mersin, as was done at the wildlife market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a holistic approach is needed, which will be useful along with other infection control measures to find effective vaccines against MERS-CoV, which infects camels.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new strains of pathogens may emerge.
Various zoonotic coven are moving in the wild.
In particular, the disease-causing species of nightingale coven is very different.
These zoonotic co-infections are highly likely to mutate and reassemble into new co-infections that are highly contagious and/or potentially fatal to future infants.
In some areas of china, wildlife is not allowed to be used as food to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Given the risks of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, high preparedness and early treatment are required.
In fact, several viruses have been on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural state until conditions are favorable for dispersal.
although night owls are more likely to transmit viruses, if people know to stay away from them, they will have less contact with night owls and other wildlife.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential to better understand the ecology of cloven-hoofed and their natural carriers, which will confirm its importance in preventing animal-to-human disease transmission and future epidemics.
In summary, the most effective way for humans to prevent the origin of pathogenic viruses is to avoid the natural source of pathogenic viruses.
Many details are highlighted in the hypothesis of the origin of SARS-CoV-2.
If the nightingale transmits SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolin, it is necessary to study what the nightingale and pangolin have in common.
second, if night owls play a more direct role in human-to-human transmission of the virus, how humans can interact with night owls should be investigated.
third, if a third mammal is a true transmitter, it should be clarified how it interacts with other species, including humans, night owls, and pangolins.
Finally, both infection monitoring and research should be done as many mammals, including pets, may be at risk for SARS-CoV-2.
Night owls, pangolins, or other animals are expected to be natural carriers of SARS-CoV-2 or related viruses and the like.
Ongoing research in this area explores the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with suggestions for prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is important to update the testing requirements for suspected and unconfirmed cases of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid advisory guide for diagnosing and treating 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection and this guide provides our experience and provides a good reference for fighting this pandemic globally.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, and with ongoing research findings and clinical practices, our knowledge and awareness are gradually increasing, and therefore, the diagnostic and treatment strategies continue to be closely aligned.
In this letter, we responded to our suggestions on the guidelines and presented the new diagnostic criteria in accordance with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition) issued by the Committee on Public Health of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic, now officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was renamed severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a rapid advisory guide and published it online on February 06, 2020 by Military Medical Research.
since its publication, it has attracted much attention.
However, keep in mind that COVID-19 is a new disease, and based on current research findings and clinical practice practices, our understanding and knowledge is gradually increasing; therefore, the diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously improving.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) has issued a total of seven issues of the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines, A.E. from January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020, with some contexts significantly changed.
Now that our guidelines have received feedback from the public, they have suggested a simplified score based on their clinical experience.
Their work provides new evidence for our guidance and valuable value for this pandemic worldwide.
we give our support and thanks for this vital work.
However, their work also needs to be updated in accordance with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version of the trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), the suspected case must meet three clinical epidemiological history profiles unless it is clear that two clinical profiles need to include two items to conduct a comprehensive diagnosis:
Epidemiological history: (1) travel or presence history of COVID-19 cases reported in Wuhan City and its environs, or other COVID-19 cases reported in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with alumic acid testing); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan City and its environs, or other COVID-19-related communities prior to onset of symptoms; (4) list of confirmed kit visits (≥ 2K) to confirmed cases in the 2 weeks prior to onset of symptoms in confirmed settings (e.g., home, office, family/home, etc.).
Clinical profiles: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with primary visual characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count showing normal, decreased, or decreased lymphocyte counts during the initial phase.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on the following suspected case: 1) positive for SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR test; (2) overall genome sequence of the virus showing high susceptibility to the known novel coronavirus; (3) serum testing for specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody for SARS-CoV-2 positive in the test serum, or positive from one negative to positive from a SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody, or more than 4 times the change in the recovery phase over the critical period.
Real-time PCR testing for respiratory organs or blood samples for nucleic acid is available for viewing in the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) editions.
The blood sample for diagnosis was included in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) issues. Serological evidence was then added in the seventh edition.
These adjustments, based on the researchers' ongoing work, will include a good nucleic acid detector for rapid detection and the addition of different samples from respiratory organs, including blood samples, and a unique anti-human positive result in the confirmed test.
moreover, there is more and more information to warn us about natural and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the process table of Zhou et al. should be updated, since people without clinical symptoms are classified as of low risk.
The outcome system should also be confirmed in clinical practices and studies.
In conclusion, direct evidence will come and we invite readers to comment.
"To investigate unintentional cases and unconfirmed allegations, we recommend that they follow and obey the new guidelines of their home countries".
our team updates our guidance to help you regularly.

Stores in Australia lowered the limit on toilet paper in one purchase
On Sunday and Saturday night, Australian department store chains Wellworth and Coles lowered the sales limit on one sale of toilet paper to two and one pack in all stores nationwide.
ALDI also introduced the One Pack restrictions on Monday.
These restrictions were posted on the links of money lists and Facebook pages.
Consumers are reported to be stocking up on goods due to fears of COVID-19 and possible isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths ordered a package of toilet paper/soft to take home.
These changes follow the previous four-pack limit on exchanges introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively.
Coles said in a press release on March 8 that he was implementing a four-ban plan, that "many stores are still selling within an hour of shipments" and that the demand was "unprecedented", calling ALDI "unpredictable" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
last week, sales showed a sharp increase, according to a spokesperson for woolworths.
Costco in Canberra has limited the allowed amount to two packages last week.
To reduce the shortage significantly, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries; Walworths ordered more ready-to-sell items; and ALDI arranged special pre-sale for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Retailers Association, said retailers want to boost sales, but the local council's restrictions on truck-delivery times have made it difficult.
He expects the price of the product to fall as suppliers and other high demands are expected to reach.
ALDI announced on Monday that some warehouses will not hold an Arub special day following the release of Stock.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail specialist from the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores are filled with ready-to-eat items every night.
Toilet paper/softs are bulky items, which makes them available in small numbers in stores and when sold, open, spacious shelf space is created, creating a sense of scarcity.
"according to abc, "the idea of colles and woolworths is that if you have more stuff on the shelf, you can reduce the amount of dust that can be produced by having sanitary towels and sanitary towels in abundance, "says russell zimmerman.
The cutting-edge recycled toilet paper manufacturer said last Wednesday that its stock is running out.
Kimberly-Clark, Knex Toilet Soft, and Solaris Paper, which operates a garbage collection facility, said they work 24/7 to support supply, according to News.com.au.
Real estate website Domain.com reports that some property sellers in Melbourne are offering free toilet paper/softs to the first applicant at auction, as few auctions are held as buyers are on holiday on Labor Day weekend.
Darwin's Thursday edition of NT News, published daily, includes an eight-page introduction for use as a toilet paper.
Warehouses were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, saying they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases, according to a report from ABC Australia on March 3.
Russell Zimmerman adds that other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry cleaning, hand washing and powder, are also in high demand.
Similarly, outside of Australia, the British online supermarket Okado announced on Sunday that it will only sell 12 packs of Andres's laundry detergent.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) has now declared the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
The term "Pan-Med" is not a reference to the severity of a specific case, but to the extent to which the disease has spread, and it indicates that the UN governments have taken immediate action.
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic".
"Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, said ""If countries test, store, quarantine, search, and respond to populations"."
given the seriousness and concern of the disease, we pay special attention to taking appropriate action.
"According to former U.S. director of disease control and prevention, Dr. Tom Frieden, the pandemic is ""unprecedented"".
"In a February CNN commentary, he said, ""There has been no other respiratory virus from the onset to the next global outbreak than influenza"."
"Gert Jesus expressed the same view that we have not seen an epidemic like the coronavirus".
"Next, he said, ""and we've never seen an epidemic that can be controlled at the same time before"."
The new situation follows the decision of the World Health Organization to declare the spread of the pandemic a global threat to public health.
Dr. Anthony Fusey, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the spread of the disease is becoming more severe as it has become entrenched in the community.
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 4,600 deaths as a result.
2019-20 coronavirus outbreak is the 2019 (COVID-19) coronavirus outbreak that is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was declared a global public health emergency on December 30, 2019, and an epidemic on March 11, 2020, by the People's Republic of China.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
This case fatality rate is estimated at 4% in China, and 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand in the rest of the world.
fever, cough, and shortness of breath are the main symptoms.
complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but this time may be between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or antiviral treatment for this.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining a safe distance from other people, and self-monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect an attack.
Authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, time limits, workplace hazard controls, and closing facilities.
The pandemic has caused severe global socioeconomic stress, postponement and cancellation of sports events, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread supply shortages due to panic consumption.
In 193 countries, local or international schools and universities are closed, affecting nearly 99.4 percent of the student population.
The lack of accurate information about the virus is spreading online, leading to a growing stigma and isolation of citizens from China, South and East Asia and other countries where the virus has been detected.
Due to reduced travel and the closure of heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (the capital of Yuebei Province) announced the absence of an unknown case of pneumonia on December 31, 2019, and the investigation began in January 2020.
Most of the cases are related to the Hunan seafood wholesale market, and the virus is thought to have zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the night bird coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The first case of the virus was diagnosed on December 1, 2019, and the individual was not related to the wet market category.
Two-thirds of the cases reported in early December 2019 were market-related.
On 13 March 2020, the South China Morning Post reported that the first case was reported on 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province.On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that new cases were decreasing in China and increasing rapidly in Italy, Iran and South Korea.
There may be many minor cases reported, especially among those with mild symptoms.
On 26 April, fewer cases were reported among teenagers under 19 years of age than at any other time, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide.Patrick Valance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the UK population would need to be vaccinated before effective immunity could be achieved.
Cases refer to people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and those who have tested positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland, had official guidelines for not only testing for mild symptoms.
According to a study published on March 16, approximately 86% of COVID-19 cases in China were unrecorded as of January 23.
Statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of cases in Italy would be higher than the number of cases recorded.
The initial estimate for the baseline recombination rate (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concludes that it may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who don't know, the average time to death for a person with symptoms is 6 to 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of 10th April 2020, approximately 97,000 COVID-19-related deaths have been recorded.
As of February 5, 80% of the deaths reported in China were over 60 years old, and 75% were without pre-existing circulatory and diabetes conditions.The official death rate due to COVID-19 is generally for people who died with COVID-19 as per official protocols.
The number of deaths due to COVID-19 may increase, excluding those who died without being tested, such as those who died at home, in the family clinic, etc.
Partial data in Italy reveals that the death toll from the pandemic is 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
"A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said, ""We know that [the reported death toll] is underestimated""; such underestimated sub-catastrophic reports in the U.S. are rare during the pandemic, as was the case with the H1N1 swine flu outbreak in 2009. The first confirmed water-borne death occurred on January 9, 2020".
The first death from mainland China occurred in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia in France on February 14.
As of January 28, more deaths have been reported outside of China in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On March 13, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths on every continent except Antarctica. Various measures were taken jointly to measure the death toll.
These numbers vary by location, but are often influenced by the number of tests being conducted, the quality of health care, the physicians and leaders, the time since the outbreak, and factors such as age, gender, and general health of the population.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global case-death rate as of April 10, 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
The number varies from region to region.
In China, the case-related mortality rate decreased from 17.3% (U.S. for those diagnosed from January 1-10, 2020) to 0.7% (U.S. for those diagnosed after February 1, 2020). Other measures include case mortality rate (CFR), which is the percentage of people who have been tested for the disease, and infection mortality rate (IFR), which is the percentage of people who have been tested for the disease (tested and untested).
These statistics are not time-bound and are followed by a specific case-process from a specific population.
several scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Oxford University Health Centre, based on evidence, estimated the mortality rate from the pandemic to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The initial estimates for this range are based on the first COVID-19 test in Germany and the statistical study on the CFR estimate.
WHO reports that the epidemic is under control.
It is difficult to say with certainty when the epidemic will reach its peak and for how long, and it may vary from place to place.
The Penn State University's Marsage Penn study shows that the rate of infection remains the same, and the rate of infection is decreasing as the number of infected individuals decreases.
But it is impossible to predict when this will happen.
"Zhong Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, applauded that if all countries act to follow the advice of the World Health Organization on measures to contain the spread of the virus, "it could stop by June".
"On March 17, Adam Kucharski of London Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said SARS-CoV-2 ""will be recurrent for about a year or two years"."
"According to a study by the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures are needed (perhaps 18 months or more) until a vaccine is available".
"William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, 'This coronavirus is so infectious that it's hard to say it will go away completely, and I think it could come back every year and turn into a seasonal disease.'"
The extent of the damage is determined by joint immunity and DNA mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms are relatively non-specific and those who are infected may not show symptoms.
Two common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, acne, loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, tremor, vomiting, sudden coughing with blood clots, itching, or skin swelling. The World Health Organization says that approximately one in six people may become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists so-called emergency symptoms such as shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden tension, difficulty walking, and swelling of the face or lips; if these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention is recommended. Further spread of the disease can lead to acute pneumonia, severe respiratory distress, decay, infection, and death.
Researchers suggest that those who may have been infected, some of whom may have no symptoms, but who have tested positive for infection, should be closely monitored and screened to eliminate infection.
Chinese estimate the relative absence of signals from a few to 44%.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) is in the range of one to 14 days, usually five days.An example of uncertainty is that the estimated proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell was initially 30%, and later decreased to 15%.
Details of how the virus is transmitted are yet to be revealed.
The disease is transmitted primarily through close contact and small droplets formed during kissing, nibbling, or talking, with close contact being within 1-2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
studies have shown that uncovered stool can create wetlands ranging from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some conclude that the virus can be transmitted through droplets that may form during speech and these droplets may remain in the air for a long time. Respiratory droplets can also be produced during breathing, including speech, but the virus is generally airborne.
They may land on the mouths or noses of nearby people or be absorbed into the lungs.
Carsiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can expose the respiratory system to infections transmitted by air.
infected surfaces, including the skin, can spread when a person touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth after touching them.
Although there is a risk of transmission through the intestine, this risk is very low.
The Chinese government denies that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by mouth.The virus is highly transmissible in the first three days of exposure, although it is not symptomatic and can be spread by urine or feces.
people who tested positive three days before they started showing symptoms, suggesting that the disease could be transmitted before they showed symptoms.
There were few laboratory confirmed cases of the virus, but similar cases were reported in other countries when Nikkei was studied.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said it was not entirely clear how easily the disease spread, whether one person transmits the disease from two to three individuals.The virus can remain on surfaces for hours to days.
Especially on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, the virus can survive for up to three days, on copper up to four hours.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other pets have also been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but British officials recommend washing hands after touching animals, as if touching an infected person's surface.
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel respiratory illness virus, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia associated with severe respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature with the related coronavirus. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by home soap, because soap removes the virus's protective layer. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
Zenotec is thought to have originated.
Genetic testing shows that coronavirus is genetically classified from genus betacoronavirus, subgenus serbevirus (lineage B), and two other strains from the leaf wasp.
At all genomic levels, the bat-type coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13) is 96% similar to other bat-type viruses.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found only one amino acid difference in some parts of the genome sequences between pangolins and human viruses.
A full-genome comparison so far has found that approximately 92% of the genetic material is shared between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is sufficient to confirm that pangolins are intermediate carriers.
The virus infection can be treated according to the symptoms, but can be confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging.
A study in Wuhan that compared PCR to CT showed that CT is more sensitive than PCR, but with less clarity than other lung cancer and many visual features similar to disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used for screening for COVID-19 or as a first-line test.
The World Health Organization released the first edition of the guidelines for the process of RNA testing for the SARS-CoV-2 study on January 17.
The test uses real-time counter-reproductive polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test may be performed on a respiratory organ or a blood sample.
The results are usually available from a few hours to a day.
The test is usually done by scanning the inside of the nose, and a sample of the throat swab may be taken. Many laboratories and organizations are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these have been sufficiently validated for widespread use.
The serological test developed by Celx in the United States is approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
radiographs and computed tomography (CT) and the characteristics of people with symptoms include irregularly shaped glass and a fluid between the gland and the lungs.
The Italian Radiology Society is working on a global online image database that shows verified incidents.
Due to the overlap of other infections such as adenovirus, the scope for detecting COVID-19 from an unconfirmed PCR image is limited.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and considered it as a screening tool for outbreaks, which is faster and more careful, although the image shows little difference for the disease.
Artificial intelligence-based neural networks have been developed to capture the contents of the virus on radiographs and CT scans.
Methods of transmission, including general hygiene, hand washing, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and rubbing and sneezing on soap and throwing soap directly in a garbage disposal.
people who have already been infected are advised to wear surgical masks before going to public places.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.Many governments have banned or advised against all non-essential travel to and from countries where the spread is widespread.
However, the virus has reached a point where it is spreading in communities in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in the community, and some members of the community do not know where or how they were infected. Health care providers who care for vulnerable communities are advised to take regular and systematic precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection.
The use of government-owned location data on mobile phones for this purpose has raised individual concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 organizations calling for limits on such spying.
Many mobile applications have been released for use on philanthropic platforms, and on April 7, 2020, many experts expect to see a new version of the technology, using Bluetooth as a closely.
If users have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, a message will be sent. Misconceptions are being spread about how to prevent infections, for example, washing the nose and mouth with mouthwash is not effective.
Although many organizations are working to create a vaccine for COVID-19, no vaccine has been developed.
hand washing is recommended to reduce the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or having their hands cleaned, before eating, and after touching their nose, chewing, or sneezing.
This is because the virus dies outside the body by washing with soap.
CDC recommends using a 60% alcohol hand sanitizer where soap and water are not available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be cleaned with several solutions (stainless steel cleaning in one minute), 62% ethanol, 50% propepolol, 0.1% sodium hypochloride, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and crohexidine gluconate, have been shown to be less effective.
CDC recommends that COVID infection is suspected or confirmed in places such as service areas, offices, or child care facilities, and that areas such as lavatories, shared facilities, and shared electrical utilities, desks, shared computers, ATMs, and so on should be cleaned with a disinfectant.
health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses with a wrapper or a cloth when they are taking a picture or exhaling, and that any cloth be immediately discarded.
Surgery is recommended only for infected people, as it prevents the virus from spreading and limits the spread of the virus when the person speaks, sneezes and sneezes.
the world health organization has issued guidelines on when and how to wear masks.
"According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Lehigh University, ""masks can reduce the risk of people touching their faces, which in turn prevents a major source of infection that can occur with unwashed hands"." Masks can also prevent people who may have the disease from spreading it to others".
Healthy people should not wear face and nose masks, even though they realize that it is good to wear face and nose masks, advising the NHS to only do so if they are nippy and confused with people who are supporting COVID-19 patients.
Many countries have begun to encourage the use of face masks by their citizens.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing medical non-woven face masks. China recommends the use of disposable medical masks (1 meter (3 feet) or less) for the healthiest segments of society, especially when in close contact with other people.
It is recommended to wear a surgical mask when using public transportation or when staying in crowded areas.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to wear cloth face masks and wash them daily.
Czech Republic and Slovakia ban people from going outdoors without wearing masks or covering their nose and mouth.
On march 16, vietnam ordered any citizen to wear a face mask when going out of the house to public places to protect themselves and others.
the government of austria requires anyone entering any grocery store to wear a face mask.
Israel asks all its citizens to wear masks and face coverings when going out.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks a day since mid-March, has ordered passengers using trains and city buses to wear face masks from April 1.
panama requires everyone to wear a face mask when they go out, and encourages those who cannot afford to wear a face mask to do their homework.
Face masks are also widely worn in Japan, North Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing or (also known as physical distancing) involves preventing the spread of disease and reduces contact between individuals, thus reducing the spread of disease.
The measures include quarantine, travel bans, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters and shopping malls.
Individuals can implement social distancing by staying home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, saying goodbye without touching, and isolating themselves from others.
Many governments are currently recommending and making it mandatory to social distancing in the pandemic-affected states.
The number of people in the United States government and the Health Organization's recommended group meetings has been reduced from 250 (if there are no known COVID-19 symptoms) to 50 and then to 10.
"On March 22, 2020, Germany banned anyone from meeting outside with more than two people. The CDC recommends that people with diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, weakened immune systems and other complex conditions stay out of the home as much as possible in the area of the outbreak. In late March, WHO and other health organizations began replacing the term ""social distancing"" with ""physical distancing"", which is due to the reduction of physical contact by unintentionally maintaining social connections on the Internet or at the door".
The use of the term social distancing refers to people who must engage in complete social isolation, rather than being advised to continue contact with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during a global pandemic.
These include recommending that sex be only with someone who lives with the virus or who does not have symptoms.
For people suspected of being infected and with COVID-19, isolation at home is recommended.
Health agencies have issued detailed self-isolation guidelines.Many governments recommend that people in areas where the virus has spread self-isolate.
Strict self-isolation guidelines are given to those in high-risk groups.
People who may be exposed to someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region where the virus has spread are advised to self-isolate for 14 days from the last day of exposure.
strategies to control transmission are to block or prevent and reduce.
The curfew is in the early stages of the pandemic and is intended to identify and isolate infected people and introduce other new ways of infection control to reduce transmission to the rest of the population.
If the spread of the disease cannot be contained further, trials will then be taken to the endurance stage, with measures taken to slow the spread and deal with the effects on the health care system and the community.
Combined measures of capture and containment can be taken together.
Reducing the baseline reproduction rate to below 1 requires more drastic measures to reverse the global epidemic. One part of controlling an infectious disease outbreak is to try to reduce the outbreak using an epidemic approach known as reducing the spread of the disease.
This will allow more time to prepare vaccines and treatments, thus avoiding overcrowding of healthcare providers.
Self-prevention measures that include non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the epidemic include hand hygiene, mouth and nose masks and self-isolation; social measures to implement physical distancing, such as closing schools, cancelling public gatherings; public participation to ensure that such restrictions are accepted; and adequate sanitation.
Other countries have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screening and quarantine, and will issue notifications when infected people are active.
Singapore has extended its support to those who have temporarily isolated themselves, and has reimposed penalties on those who have done so.
Taiwan has increased the production of face masks and integrated distribution of medical supplies.The survey of Great Britain and the United States shows that there are serious challenges in mitigation (reducing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and control (reversing the progression of the epidemic).
The use of preferential policies reduces primary health problems by two thirds and deaths by half. But thousands of deaths and health practices show that there is still much more to the problem.
While the virus is spreading in humans, it may be preferable to use suppression, but it should be waited ((or until a vaccine is available, if that comes first), and the transmission will respond quickly when the circumstances warrant.
Long-term interventions to contain the epidemic will lead to a social and economic crisis.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but development efforts, including testing of existing drugs, have not been undertaken.
Taking over-the-counter medications, drinking fluids, and resting may help reduce symptoms.
depending on the weight, oxygen therapy, blood transfusions, and respiratory support may be required.
steroid use can lead to worse effects.
Several sites approved for treatment of viral diseases are being tested for COVID-19.
"The World Health Organization also suggested that some ""traditional and home remedies"" may provide relief from the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19".
WHO says capacity building for the needs of COVID-19 patients and improving health care is a fundamental measure to curb the spread of the disease.
ECDC and the World Health Organization European Regional Office issued guidelines to hospitals and primary health care services, including focusing on laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, cancelling procedures where possible, identifying and isolating COVID-19 positive patients and training staff to increase the capacity of acute care and increase the number of respirators and beds available.
There are many theories about the origin of the first case (patient zero).
The first case of coronavirus was reported on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In one month, the number of coronavirus casualties in Hubei has gradually decreased.
Many of these were linked to the Hawaiian seafood wholesale market, which is in addition to selling live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these animal species, or in other words, zoonotic origin.
"On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues to the emergence of a "" SARS-like coronavirus""".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, while another, Ai Fen, was disciplined by the chief for spreading false rumors.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued an official announcement on December 31 and informed WHO.
"A sufficient number of unidentified cases of pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan in early January to be tested. During the initial phase of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days".
In early and mid-January 2020, the Chinese New Year migration and transit hub and major railway interchanges helped spread the virus to other Chinese provinces.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
On March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy in the number of confirmed cases. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide, with more than 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 recoveries.
Nearly 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have begun border controls to restrict free movement.
National measures include curfews (no-go, lockdown) and restrictions on movement.As of April 2, nearly 300 million or 90% of citizens in the United States were under curfews, 50 million in the Philippines, 59 million in South Africa, and 1.3 billion in India.
On march 26, 1.7 billion people were either confined or otherwise confined, up from two to 2.6 billion. This covers about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan on December 1, 2019, while an unconfirmed report indicates that the previous case was reported on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian noticed a case of pneumonia of unknown origin on December 26, and reported it to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) in Wuhan Jianghan Hospital on December 27.
December 27, 2019 Genetic testing of patient samples shows the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
The announcement was released by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The World Health Organization was notified on the same day.
At the time of these notifications, the underwater doctors received a warning from the police for spreading alubalta.
China's National Health Commission said there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission in the first place.
In late january, the chinese government launched an active campaign to stop the spread of the virus, which was described by the general secretary of the communist party of china, xi jinping, as a "people's war".
In what has been described as the largest isolation in human history, on January 23rd, the Cordon Sanitaire, which bans both inbound and outbound water travel, was implemented in 15 cities in Hubei, affecting some 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year (January 25) is cancelled in many places.
The officials also announced that a temporary hospital called Hwaseongsan Hospital will be built within 10 days.
another hospital, the leschenshun hospital, was built later to treat more patients.
In addition to newly built hospitals, China has converted 14 special facilities in Wuhan, such as public recreation areas and stadiums, into state-of-the-art hospitals.The government took additional measures to prevent the COVID-19 epidemic on January 26, including the issuance of new announcements and notices for passengers and the extension of the days of special celebrations.
Universities and schools across the state are closed.
Several measures have been taken in Hong Kong and Macau regions, especially with regard to schools and universities.
In many regions of China, remote working measures have been implemented.
travel restrictions apply both inside and outside of hubei.
museums temporarily closed as public transportation changes across china.
"Public movement controls have been implemented in several cities, and around 760 million people (about half of China's total population) are under house arrest. After the spread entered a global phase in March, Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the virus from ""entering"" China from other countries".
Beijing, for example, has quarantined foreigners for 14 days in a forced quarantine area.On March 23, only the case of Nandez was reported in China five days ago, due to a traveler from Istanbul coming to Bagansou.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that domestic cases had been essentially contained and that the spread had been controlled in China.
On that day, travel restrictions in Hubei were eased, which was within two months of the restrictions outside Wuhan.The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on March 26, 2020, that people with entry visas or residence permits would not be able to enter from March 28, but it was not clear when this policy would be lifted.
People who want to enter China must apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.

"The pandemic has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled for late July, but the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event will ""be held again after 2020, but not beyond the summer of 2021"". Casinos and gaming venues have been closed worldwide and live poker tournaments have been postponed or canceled".
The industry has also been hit, and many bands have stopped their concert tours.
many large theaters, such as broadway, have suspended all their shows.
"Some artists have explored the possibility of creating and sharing traditional live talent on the Internet as an alternative to live streaming concerts or web-based ""festivals"" to allow artists to perform, distribute and publish their work".
A number of coronavirus-focused Internet entertainment has spread online, many of which have unexpectedly turned into jokes and distractions.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic, high levels of isolation, immigration hostility and racism have been observed among Chinese and Asians, people of East Asian descent, and people from Europe, the United States, and other countries with high incidence.
incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility are rife in many countries, and are also present in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia Pacific region.
February reports (when most of the reported cases were in China so far) have been criticized by various groups around the world as racial sentiment that the Chinese people are just as likely to get the virus or that it is a legitimate retaliatory measure.
anti-China sentiment is rising in some African cities.
Wuhan and Hubei are often discriminated against simply because they are the source of the virus.
help online and offline for chinese in areas affected by the virus.
In countries such as Italy, which saw the first high-profile outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe, a new hotspot, suspicion and hostility may follow. Citizens of Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have been collecting signatures to prevent people from entering their country from China in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has been widely shared on Twitter.
There have been reports of racial violence and violence among the Chinese population, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States.
US President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus", making him racist and anti-China.
In Ukraine, protesters attack a bus carrying Ukrainians and other foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sanzari.
Students from northeast India, which shares a border with China, and students studying in India's mainland cities have reportedly faced harassment in connection with the coronavirus pandemic.
"In West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, the president of BJP State Branch, said China has ruined nature and ""that is why God is avenging them""".
"The Chinese Consulate in Kolkata later denounced the comments as ""false"". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents has been rampant due to the pandemic, with foreigners being described as ""external trash"" and ""targeted for disposal"".
Many newspapers with pay-only sections have omitted these sections due to some or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
many scientific publishers have made scientific papers related to the pandemic available for public access.
Some scientists have shared their findings on servers like bioRxiv to speed up pre-printing.

Laboratory tests use methods to detect the presence of respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus and antibodies that respond to this infection.
The virus in the samples is detected by RT-PCR, which is able to detect the corona virus RNA.
This test is limited and is useful for detecting SARS-CoV-2.
help to identify the most recent or active infections.
Serology is useful for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests show how many people have the disease, including how many people have the symptoms but little or no symptoms to report.
The exact mortality rate of the disease and the immunity of the population can be determined from this test.
Due to limited testing, there is no definitive data on the extent of transmission in any country as of March 2020.
As of march 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, with significant variations in testing across countries.
This separation has the potential to have a significant impact on mortality rates, as it is higher than the estimates in some countries.
The test uses a simultaneous reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to examine a sample obtained by sucking or using a swab, such as a nasal swab.
Results are available in a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing using a throat fluid sample is reliable only in the first week of infection.
The virus then disappears from the throat and replicates in the lungs.
For infected individuals tested in the second week, an alternative sampling device from Deep Airways may be used with a suction catheter or a suction result (distance).
One of the first PCR tests was launched in Berlin in January 2020 by the manufacturer Charité.RRT-PCR, a reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), has been developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and has produced 250,000 tests.
The United Kingdom also developed a test on January 23, 2020.Kogenebiotech, a South Korean company, developed a clinical-grade PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
"It seeks the ""E"" strain found in all coronaviruses, and seeks the RdRp strain for SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI group was one of the first organizations to receive emergency emergency benefits from the China National Health Products Administration, and is a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 identification tool. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States is also developing a 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RT-PCR screening panel for community health laboratories at the same time through an international agency source".
Of the three genetic tests, the detection of an incorrect reagent in the oldest diagnostic equipment led to incorrect results and caused a scandal at the CDC in Atlanta, where an average of 100 samples per day were successfully tested throughout the month of February 2020.
As of February 28, 2020, two-unit tests were not considered reliable, and so far, national and local laboratories have not received approval to conduct tests.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories in the United States began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of a national RT-PCR-based COVID-19 test.
Quest Diagnostics has released the national COVID-19 test on March 9/2020.
There is no dose limit, and sample collection and staining must be done according to CDC standards.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the state-run Virology and Biotechnology Research Center VECTOR.
On March 12, 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic had developed a test for COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received approval from the FDA to perform a test with a maximum of 3.5 hours of results, which allows for 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for the testing of the Abbott m2000 system, and the FDA granted similar approvals to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid received the same EUA from the FDA, which lasts 45 minutes.
FDA recommends that isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology be used on license as a PCR replacement.
Since this variable temperature does not require a cycle, a positive result is produced in as little as five minutes and a negative result in as little as 13 minutes.
There are currently 18,000 machines in the United States, and Abbott is accelerating production to make 50,000 tests per day. The test using monoclonal antibodies is directly linked to the novel coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N protein), and like the rapid influenza test, it is expected to show results in 15 to 20 minutes.
The March 2020 Literature Review concluded that the cost of chest X-rays in the early stages is very low, but that CT \[computed tomography] results may exist even before the markings are on the scene.
Typical features on the CT include dual multilobar ground-glass opacifiers with parallel, unimpeded, and backward distribution.
Subdiversity stress, misplaced values, and inclusiveness increase as the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR to CT in the baseline water showed that CT is more receptive than PCR, but with a lower sensitivity, most of the imaging characteristics are similar to those of pneumonia and disease progression.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT should not be used as a first-line test for COVID-19.
The immune response to infection is a product of antibodies, which include IgM and IgG.
These are used to detect infection, determine immunity, and in population studies in people 7 days or more from the onset of symptoms. Testing may be done in central laboratories (CLT) or at point-of-care (PoCT).
high-speed automatic systems can perform these tests in most clinical laboratories, and the amount of detectable material is determined by the amount of product in each system.
A blood sample is typically used for CLT, but serum samples may be used to test for immune response.
A blood sample for poct is usually obtained by injection.
Unlike PCR methods, a triggering measure is not required before release.On March 26, 2020, 29 institutions that had notified the agency as necessary were now able to distribute anti-human tests.
On April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under the Emergency Use Authorization.In late March 2020, the FDA received European authorization for Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics IgG and IgA to detect antibodies in blood samples.
The test capacity is to test hundreds of samples per hour, which is faster than the usual virus RNA by PCR.
The antibodies are usually detected within 14 days of infection. As of early April, no antibody testing equipment was available in the UK.
Hong Kong has taken steps to allow suspected patients to stay at home, where the emergency department gives the patient a sample tube, they inject it, return it and get the test results later.The NHS in England is making arrangements to screen suspected cases at home, prevent suspected people from infecting others if they go to hospital, and use ambulances if they are used to clear infection.
In Germany, according to the National Medical Cooperation of Legal Health Insurance, on March 2, 10,700 tests were performed in the previous week, compared to the 12,000 tests per day in ambulances.
medical examination costs are covered by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to perform 160,000 tests per week.
by march 19, a driving test was to be held in many major cities.
The total number of tests in Germany on 26 March 2020 is unknown, as only positive results are reported.
"A preliminary laboratory study shows that at least 483,295 samples were tested from the calendar week 12/2020 to 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were found positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital tested a method to test samples from 64 patients at a time, only if the combined sample was positive by mixing samples.
With construction under the close supervision of BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the model work in Hubei could have increased by 47%, and the cost of isolation would have doubled had the testing process not begun.
The Wuhan laboratory is followed by 12 other laboratories in cities across China, including Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.
On March 4, 2020, daily mass testing was 50,000. Open source multiplex designs released by Origami Assays allow for the analysis of 1122 COVID-19 patient samples using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be done in small labs and do not require robotic fluid containers.
In March, shortages and shortages of test material became a major obstacle to mass testing in the European Union, UK and USA.
This has led some authors to investigate some of the diagnostic procedures, such as heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA sequences and allow further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates is testing more per capita than any other country, and is on track to reach the general public.
"This is a drive-by, non-public testing facility for Group 42 and BGI (which is based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency lab in China)".
The lab, built in 14 days, is capable of performing thousands of RT-PCR tests per day, the first in the world outside China to do so.
Different test sequences target different strains of the coronavirus and have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German recipe for manufacturing equipment for low-income countries that cannot make their own.
The German prescription was prepared on January 17, 2020, while the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was not ready until January 28, which delayed testing in the United States and China, and the U.S. experienced problems with the reliability of diagnostic tools at the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide adequate diagnostic tools to meet the needs and to provide advice from health professionals.
On the contrary, experts say, South Korea's extensive testing capacity has helped to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government has been building up testing capacity in the private sector laboratories for several years, mostly in the private sector.
On March 16, the World Health Organization (WHO) urged accelerated testing to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.The increased demand for diagnostic equipment due to the high prevalence of the virus has led to a shortage of hundreds of thousands of virus detectors and a shortage of chemicals.
In March 2020, China announced problems with the accuracy of its detection equipment.
In the United States, the CDC's tests were problematic, and the government removed bureaucracies that restricted private testing. Spain had purchased the tests from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but the results were not accurate.
The organization explained that the incorrect results could be due to the lack of sampling or the incorrect use of the equipment.
According to the Spanish Ministry, the devices that gave the wrong results will be returned and replaced with a different diagnostic device provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. The Czech Republic has given 80% of the diagnostic devices it purchased from China with the wrong results. Slovakia has also purchased 1.2 million diagnostic devices from China, which have also provided incorrect data.
Prime Minister MatoviÄ suggested these be dumped in the Danube.Ateş Kara, an employee of the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that Turkey had not used the testing kits it had purchased from China because they had a high error rate.The UK had purchased 3.5 million testing kits from China, but announced in early April 2020 that they could not be used.
Testing, identifying positive people and monitoring people with SARS-CoV-2 has produced positive results.
Researchers in the Italian city of VÃ2, where the first COVID-19 deaths were recorded in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests on a total population of 3,400 people in ten days.
Half of the positive people had no symptoms and all known cases were in isolation.
Restrictions on travel to communities have been put in place to stop new infections.
With a high demand for touch lines, travel restrictions and quarantining, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic has spread much more slowly in Singapore than in other developed countries, but no measures have been taken to force the closure of restaurants and retail outlets, which is extremely severe.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home until March 28, but schools reopened on March 23 after the holiday period.
Many other countries have managed to contain the epidemic with high levels of contact surveillance, restricted travel, testing, quarantine, but less so with moderate national movement restrictions, as in Iceland and South Korea.
According to statistics, countries with more tests than deaths are likely to have a lower risk of infection, perhaps because these countries can easily identify those with no or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience in testing for COVID-19 send the first five positive COVID-19 samples and ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of WHO's 16 testing centers for stabilization testing.
Of the 16 suggested laboratories, 7 are in asia, 5 in europe, 2 in africa, 1 in north america and 1 in south america, and 1 in australia.
In the following table, the percentage of people tested is influenced by the country's testing policy.
Countries that test only people in hospitals have a higher percentage of positive cases than those that test their entire population, meaning that other factors remain the same, whether they have symptoms or not.
hand washing (or hand sanitizing), also known as hand hygiene, is the practice of cleaning hands to remove dirt, grease, germs, or other unnecessary materials.
washing hands with soap at specific times of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as measles and cholera, which are transmitted to the mouth by unwashed hands.
For example, if people do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous tissue), they may also contract respiratory diseases such as influenza or the common cold.
The five critical times during the day when washing hands with soap is necessary include: before and after using the toilet, after cleaning the baby's lower body or changing diapers, before feeding the baby and before eating, and before and after preparing food or touching raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing.
before, during, and after preparing food.
before and after caring for a sick person.
after changing diapers or cleaning a baby after using the toilet.
after you squeeze, suck, or sneeze.
after eating animals, or after touching animal waste.
medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
washing hands before taking medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary purpose of hand washing in medicine is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or germs that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause injury or disease.
this is especially important for those who work in the food or medical field, but it is also a useful experience for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of whooping cough; and reducing respiratory infections.
and plans to reduce infant mortality from home births.
A 2013 study found that improved hand-washing habits may lead to slight improvements in the height of children under five.
In developing countries, the death rate of infants from respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple step can reduce the death rate from these diseases by about 50%.
Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce the incidence of seizures by up to a third, compared to providing clean water to low-income areas.
A 48% reduction in cough frequency may be associated with hand washing with soap. Washing with soap is the single most effective and simple way to prevent cough and acute respiratory infections (ARI) in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
pneumonia is the leading ARI and the leading cause of death in approximately 1.8 million children under the age of five years each year.
about 3.5 million children die each year from diarrhea and pneumonia.
According to UNICEF, hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet routinely can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, halve deaths from diarrhea, and reduce deaths from severe respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is often combined with other hygiene measures as part of water, sanitation, and personal hygiene (WASH) programs.
hand washing also protects against contagious skin diseases transmitted through direct physical contact.
minor damage to the hands washing can lead to skin damage due to dryness of the skin.
A 2012 study in denmark found that excessive hand washing can lead to a skin condition called hand itching, which is common, especially among health care workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
To reduce the spread of infection, there are five critical times during the day when washing with soap is necessary: after using the bathroom (urine, faucet), after cleaning the baby's lower body (changing the sanitary unit), before feeding the baby, before feeding and before/after preparing food or touching raw meat, fish or poultry.
Proper handwashing practices are needed to prevent the spread of disease, including before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, passing or blowing your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals and after touching waste.
in many countries, the minimum amount of handwashing with soap is recommended.
A 2015 survey on handwashing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households wash their hands at home. A 2014 survey showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest share of 97 percent. Near the middle, the United States had 77 percent, and China had the lowest 23 percent.
The "Essential Health Care Program" proposed by the Philippine Department of Education is cited as a model for action to improve children's health and education.
The main objective of this national program is to inform twice a year with the slogan of washing hands regularly with soap, brushing your teeth regularly with fluoride and killing germs.
It has been successfully implemented in indonesia.
The best way to remove microorganisms from the skin is to add water to soaps or liquid soaps.
The main function of soaps and liquid washers is to reduce solution barriers and increase solubility.
water alone is not enough to clean the skin, since the oils and proteins that make up organic soil cannot be easily removed by water.
However, cleaning is aided by a balanced water flow ..
dry soap can be recycled and may contain bacteria from previous use.
A few studies that have tested the transmission of bacteria with contaminated solid soap have concluded that it cleanses germs from the bubble and causes little harm.
CDC still says liquid soap is preferred for hand-free controls
Antibacterial soaps have been widely popularized in a society that values healthy habits.
to date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antibiotics or antimicrobials will favor naturally resistant cells.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial carriers such as tricone, which contains a large list of cell sizes.
Therefore, even antibiotic resistant forms may not be as effective as they might be thought, unless they are selected with antibacterial soaps.
In addition to skin protection agents, advanced forms such as pH controllers, antibacterial active benzoic acid, and skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, cinnamon, herbal extracts) may contain acetic acid, ascorbic acid, and lactic acid. A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health found that clear soaps are as effective as antibacterial soaps in preventing infections and removing carriers of bacteria from the fire.
warm water for hand washing is warm enough to kill bacteria.
bacteria grow very quickly at body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water at removing soil and bacteria-possessing oils.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies show that hot water has no effect on reducing microbial pressure on our hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is another non-water-based hand sanitizer option.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic and water-based hand sanitizer alternatives (also known as alcohol-free hand sanitizers, antiseptic hand sanitizers, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are formed with a thickening agent such as carbomer (an ocular acid polymer) to be used in gel, or as a glycerin liquid, or in powder, and to reduce the use of alcohol drying to reduce the impact.
Addition of mixed hydrogen peroxide increases the activity of antibiotics. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective germ killers.
Alcohol-based detergents kill bacteria, multiple drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza, and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
70% alcohol hand sanitizer removes 99.97% of bacteria from hands (reduction of 3.5 entry, equivalent to 35 decibels) and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 entry) 7 in 1 minute after 30 seconds of hand washing. Hand sanitizers are most effective at preventing bacteria, but less effective at some viruses.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers are not completely effective in eliminating the viral disease (or norweck) viruses that are commonly the most contagious cause of gastroenteritis. Hand antiseptic or alcohol washing should be used to dry or cover both hands thoroughly.
The front and back of all fingers and the ends of all fingers are lubricated with a liquid, bubble, or gel for about 30 seconds until they dry.
The tips of the fingers should be washed thoroughly, rubbing both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends using a hand sanitizer, especially when hand contamination is evident.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and quick killing activity on microorganisms, but should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Regular use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin if moisturizers and/or skin conditioners are not added to the formula.
The effects of alcohol drying can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other lubricants to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers resulted in significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antibacterial soaps.
Allergic touch skin disease, osteoporosis, or alcohol hand disorders or the contents of alcohol hand sanitizer are less likely to cause allergies.
The risk of infectious skin diseases is higher than washing hands with soap and water.
Although effective, waterless agents do not clean organic materials on the hands, but they do destroy them easily.
This is why hand sanitizers are considered to be inadequate in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as soap and water can still be present on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer is mainly dependent on ingredients and flavor, with the efficiency level being low alcohol and alcohol-free wheels.
more recently, benzaconium chloride formulations have been shown to be less effective after repeated use, unlike alcohol.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use clay or soil instead.
ash or soil may be more effective than just water, but less effective than soap.
one concern is that soil or soil contaminated with microorganisms may increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
like soap, ash is an insecticide because it forms an alkaline solution in contact with water.
When soap is not available, the world health organization recommends ashes or sand as an alternative.
The proper handwashing routine recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent the spread of disease includes the following steps:
wash your hands in hot or cold water.
As pools can be contaminated, distilled water is recommended, and meanwhile, the water temperature does not seem to make a difference.
wash your hands often with soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers, and under your palms.
soap clears germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly with soap than with water alone.
search for at least 20 seconds.
Massaging creates a gap that helps remove germs from the skin, and long-term massage eliminates many germs.
wash thoroughly with plain water.
washing in a bathtub can re-contaminate the hands.
Wash with a clean towel or let air dry.
Wet and scratched hands are more prone to re-infection by the fungus. The most common areas of forgetfulness are the thumb, wrist, the areas between the fingers, and the fingertips.
artificial nails and cracked nail polish can cause microorganisms.
washing lotion is recommended to prevent dry hands, dry skin can lead to skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
"A variety of low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing where tap water and/or soap are not available, e.g. drawing water from a hanging jar or suitable well holes and/or using a solvent if necessary in developing countries. In cases of water shortage (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), "Tip-tap" and other low-cost alternatives are water-saving options".
Tpi-tap is a simple technology that is made by hand using a rope-wrapped hook and a small amount of water and a barrel of soap.
Although effective hand drying is an important part of hand hygiene, there is some debate about the most effective way to dry in public bathrooms.
A growing body of research indicates that paper towels are cleaner than the electric hand dryers in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted at the University of Westminster in London, and was sponsored by the paper towel industry to compare the hygiene standards of paper towels, hot air hand dryer, and the most modern jet-air hand dryer.
After washing hands and drying with the hot-air dryer, the total number of bacteria found increased on the fingers by an average of 194% and on the hands by 254%.
Jet-air drying has shown an increase in the total number of bacteria on average 42% in nail pads and 15% in bedbugs.
After washing hands and drying with paper towels, the total number of bacteria decreased to an average of 76% on the fingers and 77% on the palms of the hands. Scientists conducted tests to determine whether there was a risk of contamination of other bathroom users and the bathroom environment due to each type of drying method.
The air dryer, which was capable of blowing air at 180 m/s (650 km/h/400 mph), was able to dissolve microorganisms from hands and equipment and contaminate other bathroom users and the bathroom area up to 2 meters away.
using a hot air dryer spreads germs up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper dryers have shown no spread of mouse microorganisms. In a 2005 study by TÃœV Produkt und Umwelt, various methods of hand drying were evaluated.
the following changes in bacterial counts were observed after hand drying.
there are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are comparable to paper towels.
washing hands with hand sanitizer is another option when traveling when soap and water are not available.
Alcoholic hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing became mandatory in medical practice long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered the effectiveness of immunization in hospital environments (1846).
hospital staff have electronic devices that give them feedback and remind them to wash their hands if they forget to.
One study found a lower incidence of infection with their use.
Medical hand-washing is performed for at least 15 seconds, using soap and water or gel to rub and massage each part of the hands.
hands should be massaged by combining fingers.
If there is dirt in the fingernails, a brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can linger on hands in water, it is important to wipe them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, cover the water with a paper towel (and open any exit door as needed).
this will prevent the hands from getting contaminated again.
"The purpose of handwashing in health care settings is to eliminate and prevent the transmission of germs ("germs") from the host organism".
The new england journal of medicine reports that handwashing is becoming unacceptable in most medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before touching their patients, thus spreading germs.
One study found that proper handwashing and other simple procedures reduce catheter-related blood transfusions by 66 percent. the world health organization published a paper on regular handwashing and hand sanitization in healthcare sectors.
the organization's draft hand hygiene guidelines are also available for public comment on its website.
An important review was made by witby et al.
If a declaration of compliance with the control regulation is required, commercial equipment can measure and verify hand hygiene.
"The World Health Organization has called hand washing "five seasons".
After exposure to blood/body fluids
Before pollution-free operation, and
After patient care. Adding antibacterial chemicals to soap (infected or antibacterial soaps) indicates a hand washing agent.
Such removal may be necessary before surgery or in internal settings, where antibiotic-resistant bacteria are becoming more common. Surgery requires 'massaging' your hands, a hand-operated bathtub that can be opened and closed, dry towels to dry your hands after washing, washing with a little chlorhexidine or iodine, and a dry brush to wipe, and other antibacterial tools to clean under the fingernails.
all jewelry must be removed.
this procedure usually involves washing hands and wrists to the arm for 2-6 minutes.
Long test-time (10 minutes) is not required.
water from the handle should be prevented from leaking back into the hands during the process of drilling.
after the hand washing is completed, the hands are dried with a clean cloth and a surgical jacket is put on.
to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
In hospitals, the greatest benefit of hand sanitization is found to be 20% of the initial washing, and the benefit of hand sanitization is very small when the frequency of hand sanitization is increased by more than 35%.
Washing hands with regular soap compared to washing with antibacterial soap causes more than three times the risk of bacterial infection from food. Comparing the average 30 seconds of hand rubbing with an alcohol-containing compound to washing with antibacterial soap, hand rubbing with alcohol was found to reduce bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers in reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile from hands. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care facilities may include hand washing for school staff, increasing alcohol-based hand washing, and written and verbal notes for staff.
More research is needed to determine which of these interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
in developing countries, handwashing with soap is seen as a cost-saving, health-promoting, and nutritionally important tool.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or handwashing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it challenging to achieve global handwashing standards.
For example, while there are cheap alternatives to building handwashing stations, in most rural Africa there are few handwashing facilities near every private or public toilet.
However, less handwashing than due to lack of soap or water may also be the result of customary practices.
Promoting and educating about handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to lasting behavioral change in the public.
monitoring and evaluation are essential for this to work effectively.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in increasing handwashing in LMICs, while social media campaigns were not. One example is the UNICEF Three Star Approach, which encourages lessons in simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum criteria are met, schools can increase from one to three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations will be part of handwashing promotion campaigns to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
The global handwashing awareness campaign is another example of trying to bring about a behavioral change.Due to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the spread of handwashing emoji.
Few studies look at the overall cost of handwashing in developing countries in relation to DALYs.
However, one study found that promoting hand washing with soap is more effective than other water and sanitation measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations, such as nursing mothers or wounded soldiers in hospital, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Hungary, and the Englishwoman Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing.
many people at that time believed that infections were caused by the odor of the miyasmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne and healthcare-associated infections caused the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of disease.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak in the U.S. and the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S. have led to increased awareness in many countries of the need for washing with soap to protect oneself from such infectious diseases.
For example, in germany, posters with "proper handwashing techniques" are hung in public toilets and in buildings and airports near handwashing facilities.
the expression washing one's hands of something means refusing to accept responsibility for it or to cooperate with it.
in the gospel of matthew, the bible verse where pentecostal pittus washes his hands of the decision to crucify jesus christ, but it has become a phrase widely used in some english-speaking communities.
in shakespeare's macbeth, lady macbeth begins to wash her hands vigorously to clean the paint intended to represent her criminal conscience for the crimes she has committed and encouraged her husband to commit.
it also found that people who recall or meditate on immoral acts often value hand washing and hand sanitizer more than others.
In addition, after such meditation, they are less likely to participate in other compensatory measures, such as volunteering, where they are allowed to wash their hands.
Religions mandate hand washing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. symbolic hand washing, the use of water without soap to wash hands, is a hand washing ritual practiced by many religions, including the bahá'í faith, hinduism, tevila and netlai yadayim in judaism, lavabo in christianity, and wudu in islam.
hinduism, judaism, and islam require hand washing after using the toilet.
and, hinduism, buddhism, sikhism, judaism, and islam require hand washing before and after every meal.
Risk management at work for COVID-19
Workplace risk controls for COVID-19 are the safety measures at work that can help prevent and control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk management in the workplace will be based on the workplace and the type of work, including risk assessment of sources of risk, community spread and the individual's risk of developing COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs are jobs with low workplace interactions with the community and coworkers, requiring basic infection prevention measures such as hand washing, keeping employees home if sick, respiratory procedures, and continuing routine cleaning and infection prevention.
Moderate risk jobs are people who are in direct contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may be infected due to continued transmission or international travel.
This includes people from the community, such as schools, crowded areas, and high-end retail locations.
Risk management for this group, in conjunction with basic infection prevention measures, should include respirators with high filtration capacity and personal protective equipment, if they come into contact with a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers high-risk individuals to be at high risk for COVID-19 exposure to known or suspected persons, if staff performs aerial generating procedures and collect samples from known or suspected individuals with COVID-19.
The appropriate hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure respirators EFL and personal protective equipment appropriate to the job.
The COVID-19 pandemic can have many impacts on the workplace.
workers may be dismissed from work because of illness, caring for others, and fear of exposure.
Business processes can change, including what products are needed and how these products are purchased (either at off-peak times or through a delivery person or a ride-through service).
"Finally, shipping to areas with high levels of COVID-19 exposure may be disrupted. Epidemic preparedness and response planning can be used to take protective measures".
There are plans for many workplaces and types of work, which include sources of exposure, sources of risk from home and community, and sources of risk for each employee who is older and has a serious health condition.
They also discuss the controls needed to avoid those risks and plans for possible outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The goals of the pandemic response are to reduce transmission among workers, prevent people at risk of health problems, protect businesses, and help reduce negative impacts on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the business environment determines the response.
The hazard control framework is used to effectively control occupational safety and hazards that pose a threat to the team.
Where COVID-19 risks cannot be eliminated, effective control methods are engineering controls, which are supported by administrative control and ultimately personal protective equipment.
engineering controls can be a cost-effective method to isolate workers from work-related hazards, which is not based on the worker's behavior.
Administrative controls are changes to work policies or procedures that are made to be acted upon by the employee or employer.
Although the effectiveness of personal protective equipment is less than that of engineering and administrative control, it can help reduce some risks.
All types of personal protective equipment must be selected according to the worker, properly adhered (e.g. filters), consistently and appropriately inspected, repaired and replaced, and properly disposed of, cleaned and stored or to help eliminate contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs are those with low exposure to the community and other coworkers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, advising people to stay home if they are sick, respiratory related measures such as covering up cough and wheezing, preparing soap and garbage disposal, being prepared to work by phone and avoid shifts, encouraging employees not to use other people's tools, and regular cleaning of the workplace.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is a critical step to protect employees, customers and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people with severe respiratory problems who have fever, burning symptoms or other symptoms stay home for 24 hours, but should not take any medication that reduces fever or changes symptoms, and that sick leave policies should be flexible, allow employees to stay home, and employees should be aware of these.
According to OSHA, moderate risk jobs are those that require frequent proximity, up to six feet (1.8 m), to people who are known to have suspected or no COVID-19, but who may be at risk due to ongoing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, or those who have recently traveled to countries with high COVID-19 transmission.
This includes air purification, which is a high-impact engineering control for this and other high-risk groups, increasing respiration, introducing physical barriers such as plastic inhalation barriers, and providing customer service through the window of a drive-through vehicle. Encouraging administrative controls and workers who are at high risk for this, including staying home, changing meetings for meetings in virtual locations, setting a permanent shift, stopping nonessential travel to places where COVID-19 is frequently detected, demonstrating the benefits of physical barriers such as physical and occupational exposure and hygiene, and preparing a safe and effective response to COVID-19 and other hazards, including protective hands or hands that may be exposed to the virus, and providing a safe and effective response to COVID-19 and other workplace hazards, including the need to protect workers from exposure to the virus and other hazards.
workers in this risk group rarely use respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an aircraft, appropriate monitoring to protect crew and other passengers includes identifying the sick person with a distance of 6 feet, serving the sick person, and providing the front passenger with a face mask, or asking them to cover their mouth and nose with tissue when sick or sneezing.
Aircrew should wear disposable gloves when handling a sick passenger or when touching bodily fluids or potentially contaminated objects, and additional personal protective equipment if the passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag and contaminated items should be cleaned and disinfected thereafter. Risk control controls for commercial shipping including cruise ships and other passenger ships include postponing travel during illness, as well as self-isolation and notification.
For schools and child care centers, the CDC recommends short-term closures and cleaning or disinfection, which means that if an infected person has been in the school building and the community is not affected, then the infection is not contagious.
In low to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling travel schedules, disrupting meetings and other learning by school, stopping large gatherings in choirrooms or cafeterias, expanding seating distances, separating arrival and departure times, banning unnecessary visitors, and identifying isolated offices where children with symptoms can be tested.
In cases of high community transmission, in addition to social distancing, extended school closures may be considered as an option.The CDC estimates that immediate health risks to law enforcement personnel who perform their daily duties are low.
Law enforcement officials who must be in contact with individuals who are infected or suspected of COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during stressful hours, workers should disinfect their work belts and equipment with a spray or wiper before re-using or using household items, and store and dispose of used PPE and container and laundry clothes using the prescribed work procedure.
OSHA identifies some health care and mortuary workers as high or very high risk.
High-risk jobs include health care, support, laboratory and exposure to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This is a serious risk if employees are working on aerosol-producing processes or working with suspected COVID-19 patients.
procedures that produce airborne particles, injecting a tube into the respiratory system, procedures that initiate a pulse, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures, and tests or preventive sampling.
High-risk autopsy jobs include those who prepare the remains of people suspected of being COVID-19 at the time of death, which means that people who perform autopsies are at higher risk.Additional engineering controls for these jobs include isolating people suspected or known to have COVID-19 in the event of work that releases particulate matter into the air.
A special negative pressure breathing aid may be needed for some health care or mortuary services.
Samples should be treated with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients coming in stay in a confined confinement area based on suspicion of COVID-19.In addition to PPE, OSHA recommends that people who are suspected of working with people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those who are working in a work that produces airborne particles use respirators at a distance of 6 feet.
In the United States, NIOSH has approved N95 face masks for respiratory use or should be used as part of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes qualification testing, training, and health screening.
Other types of respirators provide greater protection and enhance comfort. WHO does not recommend full coverage, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is transmitted through bodily fluids.
WHO recommends that only personnel performing tests at entry gates wear surgical masks.
For people involved in caring for COVID-19 patients or transporting patients without emitting airborne particles, WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, eye masks or face masks and gloves.
If the air conditioning procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with a N95 or FFP2 respirator replacement.
In response to the global shortage of PPE supplies, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical limitation, i.e. access through clean windows to only those who need immediate care, use of personal protective equipment for a limited number of jobs, care for multiple people without removing one respirator, monitoring of the supply chain for personal protective equipment, and coordination for people who do not show signs.

The issue: [Covid-19] Easing the pressure and preparing for the future
Date/time of delivery: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
The following is a list of the most commonly used terms in the English language.
this month we find ourselves in a unique situation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made our global human connection clear and has highlighted our responsibility to each other.
while we have no model for the challenges, our best response is global consensus, cooperation, and community building at the heart of this process.
The friendship and concern we have seen among our employees through email, phone and chat is a testament to how great our commitment to working with these wonderful people is.
i consider myself lucky to have known all of you as a colleague.
last week, someone expressed his appreciation for our work.
It is a great sign of how meaningful it is for the world to return to Wikipedia and for this vital contribution to be online and available to everyone.
Your job makes it happen, if you take the position, if our colleagues get paid, or if our community is safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides now more than ever.
this is the time when it has a meaningful impact on the world, not just what we do but how we do it.
this mission and your role are so important that we will make some major adjustments to how we work together starting next week.
The work of the Witnesses was not to be taken lightly.
As robyn mentioned earlier, the c-team met last night to discuss our course and schedule for the coming days and months.
in that speech, we were thinking about what would be the right answer to what we were facing and what we should do to keep our organization going during this time.
we wanted to avoid extreme stress and continue our mission for a long time.
if you want to call back, that's fine.
For all employees, temporary workers and temporary workers:
the daily work schedule is 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
we are not saying it is a vacation - if you can work overtime after the normal working hours, the mission may be useful.
But our world is going to be unpredictable now, whether you need to take care of your family, go to the store or go to the doctor, your safety is our priority.
We do not track your time.
if you do, don't work.
that need not be said, but we will.
No sick days or PTO required - you just need to tell the management staff and make sure your team has key work areas covered by reviewing calendars and schedules.
(If you test positive for COVID-19, please let Brian know to get support and make sure your case is properly addressed by the administration.)
people are paid in full every hour.
we have in the past, we will continue to provide what we have to our contractors and our employees.
during normal working hours, everyone is paid.
this includes if you are unable to work because of illness.
If you want to work, we'll help you.
many people use work to convey their anxiety to the world around them.
especially at such a time, our work can be very productive.
again, this is about taking care of yourself.
Our question is to talk to your administration about what to expect and to be prepared.
some jobs are considered essential.
there are some things we need to keep doing.
SRE, HR processes, trusts and welfare, and fundraising groups (among others) perform the most critical work that may require additional support.
In all departments, we begin a process to shift the current purpose and focus to what is essential for our purpose.
we all have a lot of work to do, and we all focus on what is most needed.
procrastination is not harmful now.
We have no plans to double working hours to complete delays after this pandemic is over.
nowadays, you are not expected to work overtime to meet implausible deadlines.
we accept that circumstances have changed, and we work to set new goals and timelines when needed.
What happens on the APP?
To adapt to our new reality and daily work schedule, we need to adjust the timing of our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our goal is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will allow employees to organize their essential work, take care of themselves, take care of their families, and meet the needs of those who want to work reduced hours.
This extension of time will significantly reduce the current planning burden and pressure on the entire organization.
We will inform our staff to the board next week and let representatives and teams know what the next step is as soon as we receive the information.
Thank you for the leadership you have shown in this time, APP team.
The office environment, exposure and cleanliness
Last week, we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
But, for the sake of caution, we hired anti-virus personnel for the San Francisco office.
They made every floor infection-free using the same anti-virus mixture used in hospitals, including the reception area and the elevator banks that reach our floor.
The building has its own maintenance process using its own products to ensure the safety of tenants.
we are confident that the office will be fully ready by the time we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork and they shared their COVID-19 process with us and our staff in DC.
Last week, our D.C. office moved to a full-time work from home position, following San Francisco's guidelines.
As some of our staff in NYC know, we are also in talks to rent space in Brooklyn.
these discussions continue, but they may be delayed.
some of our colleagues are working from home for the first time.
Our long-term remote colleagues know it can be a fix, and they wanted to give you some advice:
limit the length of the meetings to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider how it can be divided into smaller sessions over several days.
clearly describe the meeting, have an agenda, and send reading materials in advance.
Make video the default, which includes tools like Google Docs and Zoom, and facilitates direct collaboration and communication.
Have someone lead each meeting, manage chats, and monitor the list of speakers, and help you take notes (or take notes together).
If you need a comfortable headset, email tech support.
use your insurance premiums for bills.
Join #remoties to discuss shared jobs with your colleagues
The human resources team is looking for ways to manage the growing distributed work in the foundation by providing a webinar-based ergonomics guide.
Last week, we asked community donors to cancel events at the Wikimedia Foundation, which are like editattons, until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
They informed us that we understand that requesting cancellation may make it difficult for them to meet the agreed aid agreement and that no one will be penalized for delay or change of these goals.
We will be doing more guiding on Wikimania and other regional and limited community conferences next week.
The character of the international community is not only sad but also a sense of relief due to the uncertainty caused by the sharp vision to focus on their own community, Wikimedia and others.
Speaking of the future, CRT is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki, with the goal of managing the pressure on the community and maintaining our relationship with them.
Keeping a close eye on COVID-19 related issues
We will be sending out invitations for a special staff meeting next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We use this time to share more new information, answer your questions, and spend time on our relationship.
we are in this together and we help in any way we can.
At this time, you can access information from this email and others with their COVID-19 related information on the Office Wiki.
CRT refreshes these pages so that all the information is in one place.
In addition, we are working to maintain a continuous relationship with workers, especially those working in the most affected countries.
If you need assistance with travel, circumstances, a major line of work or coverage challenge, or any other matter, please do not hesitate to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to provide support and implement as needed.
If there is a mystery wine that needs to be handled carefully, email Bryan Judan - Global Operations Director of Human Power.
none of these changes should be seen as losing us our jobs.
But this time, we recognize that our work and our values need to be adjusted in ways we have never seen before.
We need to support each other in order to continue working together, to provide the support we need for our activities, and to provide the services that our planet needs.
our planned work will be waiting for us at the right time.
For now, it is time to support each other and create opportunities for critical work in the weeks and months ahead.
you are all critical to making this a reality, and we want you all to protect yourselves and your families so that we can be better when the time comes.
Now - Please Wash Your Hands and Do Not Touch Your Face!
Catherine is a member of the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme found in the lining of cells in the lungs, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 is a promising drug target for treating vascular disease by inhibiting the activity of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the levels of angiostatin-II and increasing Ang (1-7). ACE2 serves as an entry point for some coronaviruses into cells.
The enzyme in humans is commonly referred to as hACE2.
Angrostin-2 enzyme is an ironloenzyme found on the endothelial and other cell surfaces.
The ACE2 protein is assigned to the N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and the C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transducer domain.
ACE2 is a highly contagious type I enzyme, which is found on the surface of the lungs and other internal organs because of its active domain.
The outer layer of ACE2 is cut from the inner layer of the cell by another enzyme called shades, and the resulting protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the form of urine.
ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 is primarily bound to the cells of lung type II alveolar cells, small intestine, blood vessel and blood vessel cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is found in the cerebral cortex, stratum, hypothalamus, and brain cells.
The main function of ACE2 is to be a relative balance to ACE.
ACE angiotensin I is a hormone that binds to vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 also decomposes the carboxylic terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) in the liver and hydrolyzes it to the vasodilator angiostatin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can destroy many other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the SLC6A19 membrane, a neutral amino acid transporter, and has been implicated in heart failure.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point for cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, the S1 cell surface proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 bind to ACE2 enzyme domain cells, allowing the virus and enzymes to be transported to endosomes and circulation within cells.
This entry process also seeks to pre-detect the S protein on the host seminal processor TMPRSS2, which is currently a research-based drug. This has led some to speculate that it may help fight infection by reducing ACE2 levels in the cell.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing with standard ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) on July 11, 2012, found that the use of ACE inhibitors had a 34% reduction in lung inflammation compared to controls.
In addition, the risk of pneumonia is similar to that of patients treated with high-risk ACE influenza, especially in patients with brain and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been used in pneumonia-related deaths, with the results being low relative to the overall risk of pneumonia.
Human ACE2 (rhACE2) cell is thought to be a novel treatment for acute pulmonary disease, a respiratory disease caused by liposaccharide inhibition, which improves pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to 24 hours of functional (duration).
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising treatment for patients with classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or with high circulating angiotensin II. Injected rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of severe respiratory stress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications designed to help track or track the process of identifying people (contacts) who may have been in contact with an infected individual.
In some government agencies and provinces, many applications have been prepared or submitted with official government assistance.
Several frameworks have been developed to build apps for contact tracking.
Privacy concerns have been raised, particularly with regard to systems based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
Low-interference options include using Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would work together to synchronize the functionality of Bluetooth-enabled devices to Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has developed a mobile app that will let citizens know if they have contacted people with COVID-19.
It is being used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community and is provided to the government, which released it as open source.In North Macedonia, Bakuku has launched a Bluetooth-based app StopKorona! to track exposure and respond quickly to people with the virus.
The app is developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app is awaiting approval to be placed on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"On April 12, the government announced that the contact tracing app is in a high development stage, and that a similar app is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid") that will launch in a matter of weeks".
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia plans to introduce a geo-fencing app for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow to prevent them from leaving their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, lists a number of problems, including false positives that could be applied to application-based systems and if the adoption of the app is limited to a minority of the population.
"To address concerns about the spread of malicious or harmful ""coronavirus"" apps, Apple has imposed restrictions on which types of organizations can add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, limiting them to only those organizations that are official or otherwise well-known".
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy activists have expressed concern about the implications of widespread surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially the fact that the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the global coronavirus pandemic will collapse once the threat is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for a limit on such spying.
The organizations have announced eight preconditions for government projects.
Monitoring should be legal, necessary and affordable;
The lengths of monitoring and monitoring shall be the same as the length of the day.
The use of data should be limited to COVID-19 purposes only;
Information security and anonymity should be protected and protected based on evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and neutrality;
Any sharing of information to third parties must be legally disclosed;
There should be safeguards to prevent abuse and violations of citizens' rights;
"Significant participation is required by all relevant stakeholders, including public health professionals and structured teams. The German Keus Computer Club (CCC) and the Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also provided detailed analysis".
If the Google/Apple plan is not necessary to solve the continuous tracking problem, it is possible to remove the tracking from their platforms.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating the ability to download and disable tracking.
Network-based surveillance approved in Israel.
Web-based solutions to access data in dry environments have potential problems.
However, not all systems with a central server should have access to private local data, and several privacy protection systems have been created that use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to search for contacts.
Instead of using a purpose-built app, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking and card transaction data, and combines the delivery of text messages from these infected individuals.
In addition to using this information, the government has made location information available to anyone, due to the significant changes in privacy laws that have occurred in that country due to the MERS outbreak.
This information is available to the public through several applications and websites. Countries including Germany have been considered to use centralized and private protection systems.
As of April 6, 2020, the details have not yet been released.
The idea of respecting privacy and tracking connections is a preconceived notion with a long history of human search, dating back to at least 2013.On April 7, 2020, they were using a privacy-respecting solution, a Bluetooth Low Power (BLE) solution, which would let them know how close they were to other phones.
However, PPP-PT is a collaborative alliance that takes both centralized and decentralized approaches and includes a single protocol, with integrated protocols such as district-based privacy protection close-range tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers, (TCN, fka contact event numbers, CEN), privacy privacy protocols and mobile communication tracking (PACT), and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all related data is applied to the device.
The privacy team at MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform that uses privacy techniques while collecting and using location or cross-road data to track the spread of COVID-19.
"Apps Gone Rogue is based on a research paper titled: Protecting Individuals' Privacy in a Pandemic, released March 2020. Another similar effort was the SafeTrace platform, developed at MIT Media Lab by Enema MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies".
SafeTrace is a secure hardware technology that allows users to share confidential locations and health information with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that information.
On 5 April 2020, the global TCN coalition was formed, which basically followed a similar approach and was divided into groups, mainly integrating protocols, to reduce gaps and create a global interconnectedness of monitoring and alerting applications.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced the release of the BlueTrace protocol, which uses the official government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a communications initiative that they said would protect privacy based on a combination of Bluetooth low-power technology and privacy-protecting databases.
They also published detailed descriptions of the key technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is designed to be released in three stages:
List of software applications that allow governments to create official privacy-preserving and coronavirus tracking apps
Google and Apple plan to simplify integration of this feature directly into iOS and Android, and to eliminate ongoing monitoring problems in the same way as distributing the system's first operating system updates after the threat has passed.
A drug recycler (also known as drug recycling, redistribution, re-inventory, or therapeutic switch) is a drug that is authorized to replicate a different authorized drug from the one that was previously manufactured.
This is one of the lines of scientific research currently being done to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research areas include COVID-19 vaccine and plasma transmission. SARS-CoV-2 has 66 potential therapeutic proteins, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
"Examining these critical areas will involve providing a reasonably effective antiviral for COVID-19 proteins".
The most important targets of SARS-CoV-2 are proteins such as papine; RNA-dependent RNA polymers, helix, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A, et al studied several candidate compounds and later strengthened and analyzed the analogy with high-quality approved drugs to accelerate the development of a strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug that would be recommended in clinical trials.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug used to prevent certain body diseases.
On March 18, the World Health Organization classified chloroquine and related hydrochloroquine as one of four drugs undergoing collaborative clinical trials.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the New York State trial process for chloroquine and hydrochloroquine will begin on March 24.On March 28, the FDA approved the use of hydrochloroquine sulfate and chloroxine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (USA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA in clinical trials and is only approved in the European Union for use as an experimental treatment for emergency care for patients who are hospitalized but unable to receive treatment in clinical trials.
According to the CDC, the use, dosage and timing of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been determined.
"doctors said they would use the drug ""if there was no other option""".
a turkish research team in istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorine in combination with zinc, vitamin a, vitamin c, and vitamin d.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting an evaluation of the use and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for prevention.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen show favipiravir is clearly effective.
35 patients in Shenzhen had median negative test results in 4 days, and the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive treatment.

b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a full-fledged vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
While no vaccine is expected to complete clinical trials, several trials are underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization said that a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the virus associated with the virus, is not expected to arrive until 18 months later.
Five vaccine candidates are in phase safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019.
A major global pandemic in 2020, leading to massive investment and research activity to develop vaccines.

CEPI report, completed in April, tracks development initiatives, speed, manufacturing capacity, scale deployment and global reach.
CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms are under research and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19 in early April 2020.
The main platform targets for the upgraded Phase I security studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (class I developer and vaccine candidate Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus vector (stage I adult and vaccine recruitment: carcinogenic biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
In April, scientists reported that 115 general vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, 78 were active projects (79, according to Milken Institute data), and 37 others had been announced, but estimates suggest that little information is available to the public (in planning or design stages).
Phase I-II trials perform the initial and safe immunity screening, typically randomized, site-controlled and determined at multiple sites, to determine a more accurate and effective dose.
Phase III trials involve additional participants, including control groups, to evaluate the efficacy of the drug in preventing the disease, and to give a negative result due to the dose.
Of the 79 vaccine trials under development (as confirmed in April 2020), 74 have not been tested on humans (still in preclinical trials).

Some vaccines have uncertain effects, also called uncertain effects.
that means they are not only useful for preventing disease.
In Australia, more randomized testing is seeking to enroll 4,170 healthcare workers.
Vaccines in development are not safe or effective.
Research studying the efficacy of vaccines in animal models associated with COVID-19, such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and other non-human rats, suggests that there is a need for time to use Phase 3 biosecurity viruses and for global collaboration to implement standardised safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no known safe and effective treatment or vaccine for SARS in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs targeted to treat SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
At the time of the MERS outbreak, it was hoped that existing SARS research could lead to the development of a useful measurement vaccine and a treatment for MERS-CoV.
In March 2020, one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine completed phase clinical trials in humans, and three others were in development, all containing a virus-containing vaccine, two equivalent-targeted (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have raised conspiracy theories that claim a virus is behind COVID-19 and the idea that a vaccine is known and already available.
Posts on various social media sites show that the company owns patents for strains and vaccines for other coronavirus types, such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from the onset of symptoms to five days may be from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some improvement in viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure has been observed.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in more than 210 countries and territories, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered from the disease. The virus is transmitted primarily through human contact, usually through biting, coughing, or talking.
These droplets are produced by breathing and usually fall to the ground or onto a body rather than being transmitted over long distances.
People can also measure by touching contaminated soil and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive in dry areas for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days after symptoms appear, although it can be transmitted before symptoms appear and later stages of the disease spread (rRT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swelling.
people who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers are advised to wear masks.
Recommendations for the use of masks for the general population may vary, with some authorities recommending their use, some recommending their use, and others recommending their use.
There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
The spread of the disease has been recorded in all six WHO regions, mostly in the region.
people infected with the virus may have flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty with arousal, and blueness of the face or lips. If these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention is recommended.
Most often, upper respiratory symptoms are seen, such as a sneeze, a runny nose, or a sore throat.
Gastric symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea occur in different percentages.
In china, some cases were initially reported only as chest blockage and disability.
in some, the disease can lead to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
this is called the time until symptoms appear.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who show symptoms develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully understood, however, initial evidence suggests they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The number of cases of people who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20 percent of confirmed cases remain undetected during their hospital stay.
The National Health Commission of China listed the first cases, including individual cases, on the cases that occurred on April 1. Of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were of the same type during testing.
Both acta and amylase can carry a wide range of viral loads.
talking out loud produces more droplets than normal speech.
According to a study in singapore, uncovered stool can produce droplets as long as 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences reports that bioaerosol can be transmitted and that air collectors give positive results for viral RNA in the passageway outside human organs.
Some medical procedures, such as catheterization and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause respiratory systems to enter the air and circulate through the air.
the risk of transmission by mosquitoes is low, although the risk is thought to be low. the virus is most contagious when people show symptoms.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is not entirely clear on how easily the disease spreads, but one person generally infects two to three others.
In particular, the virus was found in cardboard for up to one day in plastic (polypylenol) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to 99% copper for up to four hours.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used correctly. Soap products degrade, destroy, and free the immune system of viral fats from skin and other substances.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and clohydidine gluconate (a surgical inhibitor) are not effective.In a Hong Kong study, median-residue samples were taken two days after the start of hospital treatment.
Of the six patients, the first sample of five showed the highest viral load, while the sixth showed the highest viral load when the patient was tested on the second day.
Severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus, first identified in three people with severe respiratory illness in water, associated with pneumonia.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in naturally related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which breaks down the protective membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most vulnerable organs to COVID-19, as the virus attacks host cells via the enzyme agonistine enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant of the lung's II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a special coating/proteins called a "catalyst" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
acute heart attack in Wuhan, China, 12 percent of those admitted to hospital were diagnosed with the disease, which is very common.
During the progression of the disease, cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system problems, but severe myocardial damage is associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
In patients with COVID-19 infections, high levels of angiogenesis (31%) and hormone replacement therapy (25%) were found and may be associated with post-prostate.
Although SARS-COV-2 is pathogenic to respiratory cells that express ACE2 to express respiratory disease, patients with severe COVID-19 have systemic hypertensive symptoms.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells have been shown to be associated with the induction of en-6-secreted blast mononuts and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
lymphocytic infections have also been reported in autopsies.
The World Health Organization has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is instant-precision replication polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is performed on breath samples with nasopharyngeal swab. However, a nasal swelling or acute sample may also be used.
The results are available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples two weeks apart and the results are not very valuable.
Chinese scientists have been able to identify the coronavirus and publish a genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can develop separate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to investigate infections with the virus.
Anti-viral tests (which can detect active infections and if a person has had the disease before) have been in development since April 4, 2020, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experience in testing shows that only 60 to 70% are accurate.
The FDA in the United States approved the trial for early-care-diagnosis on March 21, 2020.The diagnostic guidelines released by the University of Wau at Zongnan Hospital suggested methods to identify infections based on clinical characteristics and influenza risk.
Double multi-story floor-glass gaps are common in previous infections with background, origin and backward transmission.
Sub-extensive dominance, irritable bowel syndrome (with variable alveolar filling for lobular septal thickness), and exacerbation may be seen as the disease progresses.
There is little information on the process of small lesions and changes in COVID-19 disease.
The main findings of the autopsy:
The most commonly used form of the disease is the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of the acute form of acute form of acute.
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
mild pneumonia: pneumonia, pulmonary hyperplasia, worm infections, lymphatic radicular disease and the formation of a giant cell in the middle
severe pulmonary embolism: diffuses with widespread alveolar acidosis.
DAD is a cause of severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypothermia.
Treatment of pneumonia: exposes the central fibrosis between the alveolar passages and the lungs
Blood: distributed intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a cloth when inhaling or sneezing and using a cloth inside the mouth if there is no cloth.
proper hand hygiene is recommended after any coughing or sneezing.
CDC recommends the use of cloth face masks in public settings to limit transmission if a person is a carrier. Social distancing strategies are a strategy to reduce contact among large groups of infected people by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.
Remote guidelines also include keeping people at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) away.
"As the vaccine is not expected until 2021, a key part of managing COVID-19 is trying to slow the spread of the disease, known as ""slowing the spread of the virus"".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are clearly dirty, before touching the nose and chewing, or before and after eating.
Only when soap and water are not readily available, it recommends using alcohol-based hand washes containing at least 60% alcohol. In areas where hand sanitizers are not available on the market, WHO has proposed two local product formulas.
In these formulations, the antibody activity is derived from ethanol or isosopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial glands in alcohol; it is not an active ingredient in hand antiseptics.
glycerol added as a humectant.
People apply for financial aid, which may include liquid therapy, oxygen support, and other vital organs and supports.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they have the virus wear a light face mask.
Efroaclar membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory problems but benefits are still being seen.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may be useful for people with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease.The World Health Organization and China's National Health Commission have put forward suggestions for caring for hospitalized people in COVID-19.
US intensive care physicians and respiratory therapists have followed medical advice from various agencies to use the independent data source IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For diagnoses, some medical professionals recommend the use of papetamol (acumammonoin) for first-line use with respect to ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of virus transmission when performing ventilation procedures such as intramuscular or hand breathing.
Health care professionals caring for people with COVID-19 recommend that the person use routine precautions, precautions and airborne precautions, in addition to being admitted to an airborne infection escape room (IIR).
gear recommended: PPE clothing, respirator or face mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respirators (rather than face masks) are preferred.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial settings but the FDA has approved them as masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect from airborne particles such as dust but their efficacy on a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for use outside of the product description.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face masks or home-made masks as a last resort.
Most COVID-19 injuries are not as severe as those requiring mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but minor injuries are severe.
The type of respiratory system for individuals with COVID-19 related respiratory problems is being actively studied for people in the hospital, the disease can be prevented by high nasal flow or two-stage positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either of these two treatments is equally beneficial for chronic disease.
Some doctors prefer a mechanical respirator with a gasket when present, since it limits the spread of airborne particles compared to a high nasal drain. Cases of thrush are more common in older adults (over 60 years of age, and especially over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries lack adequate hospital beds per capita, which has limited the capacity of the health system to manage the sudden increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization.
In China, a study found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygen becomes more difficult.
Air breathing that includes air pressure control modes and high PEEP is needed to increase oxygen supply while reducing the risk of air-related lung injury and pneumonia.
There is no high PEEP on old air ventilators.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems very promising.
Although it may take until 2021 to develop new drugs, many of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on people with severe illnesses.
The World Health Organization has proposed involving volunteers in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential therapeutic methods.The FDA has granted provisional approval for testing when the life of the individual is in serious or immediate danger.
It has not been evaluated in clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can detect 'close contact' using intelligence, thus identifying the risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
Facial data analysis on mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track and track infected people. It has been detected in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people suspected of being infected with the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to identify and protect those who may have come into contact with infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared enhanced telephone location data with the Robert Koch Institute, a German federal government agency to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to identify those who are escaping isolation.
Giulio Gallera, regional health commissioner of Italy, said that 40% of people continue to move in any way, according to mobile phone operators.
The german government conducted a 48-hour study over the weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
And the president of Estonia Kersti Kaljulaid has called for global efforts to create innovative solutions to the spread of the coronavirus.
individuals may face isolation, travel restrictions, medical side effects, or the risk of infection.
BBC Rory O'Connor quotes "social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic collapse are the perfect wave to harm people's mental health and wellbeing".
Symptoms that resemble other common respiratory illnesses, such as the common cold, may progress to a mild course with few or no symptoms.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, whereas severe or severe cases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Based on other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be at higher risk for severe infections with COVID-19, but data for COVID-19 is lacking.
In the most affected individuals, COVID-19 can cause rapid respiratory distress, death shock, or multi-organ failure to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
COVID-19-related complications include sepsis, unhealthy constipation, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Unhealthy drugs, especially increased prostate time, were reported in 6% of COVID-19-related hospitalizations, and abnormal kidney function was reported in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people exposed to COVID-19 show elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the first symptoms and death was ten days, of which five days were spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to ICU had a median time between hospitalization and death of seven days.
In earlier cases, the study was about 14 days in the six to 41 days from mid-term showing the first symptoms to death.
A study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China showed a 2.8% increase in male deaths and a 1.7% increase in female deaths.
Historical analysis of post-mortem lung samples reveals mobile fibroxide in both lungs, and also alveolar damage.
viral cytopathic changes have been observed in the neurons.
The pulmonary picture is similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart disease was reported as a severe roppongi or heart problem.
According to data from the United States in March, 89 percent of hospitalized patients had pre-existing conditions. The availability of medical supplies and equipment can affect the socioeconomic status of the region, as well as mortality.
The death rate varies according to the situation because of these regional differences, but it can also be due to policy issues.
counting minor cases, it can cause a very high death toll.
However, the current mortality rate is underestimated because deaths have occurred due to previously treated cases.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and are about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care compared to smokers.
Hong Kong hospital authorities confirmed that some recovered patients had a 20 to 30 percent decrease in lung capacity, and organ damage was detected by scans.
This can lead to post-extreme monitoring symptoms after recovery.
As of March 2020, it is not known whether past infections provide effective and long-term immunity in those recovering from the disease.
The incidence of the disease is suspected based on the behavior of other coronavirus, but later positive tests for coronavirus were reported after recovery from COVID-19.
instead of being treated again, these cases are expected to worsen the disease outbreak.
The virus is thought to be of natural and animal origin through naturally produced and propagated infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infection is fully human-to-human.
The first 41 confirmed studies of COVID-19 published by Lanet in January 2020 indicate the onset date of the disease is December 1, 2019.
The World Health Organization reported the first symptoms since December 8, 2019.
Several measures have been taken to measure the death toll.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the size of the test, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the early outbreak, and societal characteristics such as age, gender, and general health.
In late 2019, the laboratory-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 death toll was assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 and U07.2 for COVID-19 testing that examines clinical or related diseases with laboratory-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 disease.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate as of April 17, 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/ 2,240,191).
Other measures include the case mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals who die from the disease, and the infectious mortality rate (IFR), the percentage of infected individuals (treated and untreated) who die from the disease.
And these statistics are not kept for a specific timeframe until they decide on certain people from the vaccine.
Although not all infected individuals develop antigen systems, the presence of antigen systems can provide information on how many people have been infected.
80 (1.7%) people died in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 people in the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy.
In Gangelt, the disease spread at carnival events, and spread to young people, resulting in relatively few deaths, so all COVID-19 deaths may not normally be classified as such.
In addition, the German health system is not overcapacitated.
blood donors estimate that 3% of the population in the netherlands may have antibodies.
69 (0.004% of the population) confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
The death toll is higher in studies in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is only close to 90 percent.
In china, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for males and 1.7 percent for females.
The exact causes of this gender difference are unknown, but racial and behavioral factors may be a factor.
sex-specific disease differences, compared to women and men, can lead to higher mortality rates in men than in women, such as high blood pressure.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men, and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government is tracking sexual information related to COVID-19 infections.
studies show that men and women are more susceptible to diseases such as ebola, hiv, influenza and sars.
A large number of health workers, especially nurses, are women and are at high risk of contracting the virus.
The World Health Organization February 11, 2020 official name of the disease is COVID-19.
The Director General of the World Health Organization, Teodros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that Carbon Corona, the virus that first identified the virus, the plague and the 19 cases of the disease, was diagnosed on December 31, 2019.
In order to prevent discrimination, the name was chosen in accordance with international recommendations to avoid referring to a specific geographical area (e.g. China), animal species or human group. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization also uses the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "virus causing COVID-19" in official media.
"The disease and the virus are commonly referred to as the ""coronavirus"".
The virus and disease were commonly referred to as Wuhan coronavirus and Wuhan coronavirus when it first appeared in Wuhan, China.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization recommended that the use of temporary names for the virus and disease be based on the 2015 guidelines on the use of spaces in the virus and virus names for the acute respiratory disease 2020-nCov and 2019-nCoV.
The names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were given on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare materials such as nasal sprays and ventilator parts.
In one example, an Italian hospital urgently needed an air conditioning valve and the supplier was able to supply it in the required amount of time, a local startup bomb-fighter nurse printed 100 valves in one day, which was needed overnight.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and information have been rapidly disseminated on the Internet.
humans seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study found no evidence of virus replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
There is no cure or vaccine.
Global research on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 is being conducted by government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization established the Solidarity Trial to evaluate the effects of four existing antiviral chemicals with the promise of being highly effective.
There is no vaccine but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have both used ACE2 receptor receptors to enter cells, and have been used in SARS-CoVs in the past.
There are three vaccination methods under investigation.
first, researchers aim to create a generic virus vaccine.
The use of this type of virus, whether active or dead, to respond to new exposure to COVID-19 to enhance the body's immune response to serious disease.
The second strategy, sub-vaccination, aims to create a vaccine that tracks the immune system for specific subcomponents of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein, which helps the virus to host the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third method is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines are a new method for creating vaccines).
In these methods, experimental vaccines must be tested for safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine was initiated on four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains harmless genetic code derived from the virus that causes the disease. It has been proposed as a vulnerable antibody-dependent enhancement for preparation of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, although this is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 clinical trials are underway.
They are reviewing previously approved treatments for malaria, including four approved studies, including seven on hydrochloric acid or chloroquine.
Most of the re-used antiviral drugs are Chinese research, with nine Chapter III trials in several countries reported at the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates has been conducted.Reflovir, chloroquine and hydrochloroquine, lopevia/rutanavir and lopenavir/rudonavir in combination with interferon beta are being evaluated as treatment for COVID-19 by several existing antiviral drugs.
there is concrete evidence of the effectiveness of price cuts as of march 2020.
clinical improvement was seen in patients treated with compassionate use therapy.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was first studied in China in February 2020.
However, calls have been made for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health officials recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology notes that although a daily dose of one gram is recommended, twice the amount can be extremely dangerous and deadly.
On March 28/2020, a select group of doctors treating people with COVID-19 issued emergency use authorization for hydrochloroquine and chloroxine.The Chinese 7th edition guidelines also include the use of intervirone, ribavirin or umfenovirine against COVID-19.
Initial data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for use as an additive in the VIVO study after low-pressure accumulation was demonstrated for SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that high protein consumption of trans-tissue protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) through interaction with the ACE2 receptor is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry.
Studies of chloroquine and hydrochloricillin with or without arthromycin have found major limitations that prevent the medical community from treating these treatments without further study.Oseltamivir is not transmissible to SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytoquin storm may be complicated in later severe COVID-19 stages.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine waves. Tocilizumab was included in the Chinese National Health Commission's medication guidelines after a small study was completed.
A nationwide randomized Phase 2 trial is underway in Italy after it showed positive results in people with severe illnesses.
Combined with blood tests from Sam Frittstein to detect the Toxin Wave, it is designed to counteract such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in affected individuals.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist is relatively new to CAR T cell therapy, approved by the FDA based on studies based on the response to treatment of steroidal reversible etotoxin release syndrome published in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled data that suggests tocilizing is an effective treatment for CRS.
Antibodies developed by people recovered from COVID-19 are being investigated as a recommended vaccination method for those who need filtered and stored antibodies.
This strategy has produced unconvincing results for the experience of SARS.
A virus neutralization/control neutral antibiotic is a proposed measure that could mediate the immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as anti-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or fungio-toxicity.
Other forms of indirect antibody systems therapy, such as the use of synthetic monoclonal antibodies, are rare.
The production of infected stem cells, which are part of the bloodstream of recovered patients and contain antibodies specific to the virus, may be increased to accelerate deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, closely related syndrome
