The black box in your car?
While American road designers are struggling to find the money to repair the crumbling highway network, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box that fits easily into the dashboard of your car.
The devices that track every mile a motorist travels and relay that information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial effort by Washington and state planning agencies to renovate the outdated system of financing America's main highways.
The usual fad of highway design has suddenly sparked intense debate and the creation of various associations.
Libertarians got together with environmental groups and lobbied for the government to use these little boxes to record the miles you're going and maybe where you're going and then use that information to compile a tax bill.
The tea party is terrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy concerns.
And while Congress can't agree on whether to proceed, some states are waiting for nothing.
They're figuring out how to move to a system where the driver pays for the kilometre of road he drives over the next decade.
Thousands of motorists have already taken their black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
"This is not a matter of choosing", said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of State Governments, which plans to start tracking the miles driven by every Californian motorist by 2025.
It's going to change the way we pay these taxes.
That's what this technology is for.
The incentive is the fact that the Highway Trust Fund, funded by the taxes Americans pay at gas stations, is down.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars will go a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents a gallon, hasn't increased in 20 years.
Because of the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax by even a single cent.
"A gasoline tax is simply not sustainable", said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the mileage system.
"In the long run, this seems to be the most logical alternative", he said.
Experts call it a mileage user fee.
It's no surprise that urban liberals like this idea, because taxes can be used to change the patterns of driver behavior, which can help reduce congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
California's planners are looking to this system to plan strategies to meet the goals set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most functional long-term alternative.
Free-market officials from the Reason Foundation also favor the idea of paying drivers for the miles they drive.
"It's not a tax that disappears into a black hole", said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy at Reason.
People pay for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former US transportation secretaries, who in 2011 urged Congress to move towards a pay-per-mile policy.
The US Senate last year approved a $90 million pilot project that would involve about 10,000 cars.
However, the House of Representatives rejected the proposal, doing so out of concern for rural lawmakers representing a segment of the population whose daily life often involves traveling many miles to work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are making progress on their own.
The most enthusiastic is Oregon, which involved 5,000 drivers in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon be paying the state mileage tax instead of the gas tax.
Nevada has already completed the pilot.
New York is looking into the project.
Illinois is trying to do that to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state departments of transportation, along with the eastern coastal states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) is studying how they can implement this change.
But this concept is not limited to supporters.
In Nevada, where some 50 cars of volunteers were recently equipped with the device, drivers were concerned that the government was able to monitor their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother surveillance and similar issues have been a big problem", said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategy and operations management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the pilot project progressed, the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged surveillance devices".
There is no need to build a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to record the daily departures and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is among the few states that are trying to find available technology that would allow the state to track how many miles a car can drive, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
The pursuit of such technology has led some government agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage.
This company was not initially involved in the drive-by taxation scheme.
She wanted to break into the emerging market of legal liability insurance where drivers would pay based on how much they drive.
But this device he's testing is attracting the attention of road network designers because it doesn't use GPS and it only provides a limited amount of information that is recorded regularly by a modem.
"People will be more willing to go if you don't monitor their speed and their location", says Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
A number of major errors have appeared in some of these pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less invasive ways to do that.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose to have a GPS device or not.
Or they don't have to take any equipment and instead choose to pay a flat fee based on the average miles driven by all the residents of the state.
In other places, they hope that the cautious public will embrace the concept if the device can do more, not less.
In New York City, traffic officials are working to develop a tax system that would be equipped to pay parking time charges, provide mileage insurance, and collect speed data from other drivers so that motorists can avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists will be willing to participate because of the value of the benefits offered", states the city's planning document.
Some road designers, however, would like to know whether all the talk of paying per mile is just a giant secondary problem.
Officials from the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area say Congress could very easily solve the problem with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising the gas tax.
A one-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other fuel-efficient vehicles, so they would pay a fair share.
"No radical surgery is needed if you take plenty of aspirin", said Randy Rentschler, chairman of the House Committee on Legislative and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will have concerns about their privacy and a whole lot of other things.
Sobotka is negotiating for the SSD.
Social democracy is being mocked, the people and the grandfathers are talking and planning a common course of action.
If the Social Democrats are mature in a few weeks, they'll sit down at the negotiating table with perfectly matched partners, who will put on the table a ready-made list of demands, including ministerial posts.
The CSDP delegates will either swallow the sour grapes of the coalition or they will bow to the shaky minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka after four days of being carried on a wave of sympathy, came across for the first time.
He failed to control the political establishment yesterday, and most importantly, to get convicted liars to resign.
He is the only one confirmed as party negotiator, the other members of the team will be allowed only after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CEC).
I've apologized to the guild members and now to the citizens.
You shouldn't lie, in your personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake", said Michal Hasek, the Social Democracy's narrowest leader, after the meeting.
He added that he was not running for the post of First Vice President.
"I will announce my decision on November 10 at the U.N.V"., said Hashek.
Similar remarks were made by the Deputy Chairman of the Czech Social Democratic Party, Zdeněk Škromach, and the head of the parliamentary club, Jeroným Tejc.
He pointed out that he was elected just two days ago.
Both MPs then declared that they would do everything to ensure that the 50-member CSDP club was heard with one voice.
The absurd theater was crowned by Michal Hašek with the sentence: "I have been a member of the CPSU for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I have respected the decisions of the party bodies".
So another lie on the air.
Or perhaps when he called for Sobotka's resignation and his exclusion from the negotiating team, he forgot that the August UVP voted 57 percent that Bohuslav Sobotka is the party's candidate for prime minister?
But the head of the CSSD, by summoning the UAV, only made a powerful army of enemies the following Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood the emails of 192 members of the body and the media with a raft of gossip and rumors, eventually reminding them of the real mistakes of Sobotko's political career.
There will be a fierce fight against the dirty laundry, and signs of a dark alliance between the coal baron Zdenny Bakal and the Sabotka wing.
The discussion will focus on the friendship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer Radek Pokorny.
There are disputes in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization of the CSIS.
Warning words are spoken by the mayor of Ostrava and Sobotko's ally, Peter Kajnar: "I signed Charter 77 so that idiots would not rule the country".
If the SEC were to meet this weekend, the liars would probably be forced to ritually sacrifice their functions.
The traitors will scatter their heads in ashes and stay.
And the current winning leader of the CSDP will end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Dr. Martin on the problems with OH in Sochi: Communication with the Russians is difficult
The corners of his mouth indicate a slight smile and then he just takes a deep breath and says, "It's hard".
Working with the Sochi 2014 Olympic team is a little more complicated, according to Martin Dr.
We can forget about what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same", says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things work slower and not as accurately.
It's so confusing.
In terms of invoices, they're relatively fast, not so much in terms of delivering information on essential things.
For example, we've been asking them for three months to give us the official name of the village so we can do a whole range of things.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating.
They're still communicating in a lot of things.
Is there at least an Olympic Village?
But it's not a catastrophic situation anymore.
A month ago, we were going through empty rooms.
The houses are still standing.
What do you mean they're empty?
Do you need the floors ready?
Just the basic concrete, which is what it was like a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even though there's a danger that when we get there on January 26th as the lead, it'll still smell like glue.
And if they don't, what happens?
Do you think President Putin would send an army there?
That's what I think it's gonna be.
Just so it's not that Olympic Village = potato village.
They're more likely to miss, like, the roadwork, the details.
They may have such a state of the road that we'll have to take the London games with us.
But I'm sure they'll figure it out.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78, although that number varies depending on the nomination criteria.
Maybe the skaters will ride in the trio that they're riding.
No one has to doubt the speed skater Martina Sáblíková, but otherwise it's in development.
Are you still on your way to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I'm not supposed to be there till January 26th.
We know what the houses in the Olympic Village will look like.
We even measured some things ourselves with a meter so we wouldn't just believe the sketches.
We're also preparing a whole bunch of other things, including transportation.
And what does the mission chief do 100 days before the Olympics?
I'm preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I'm doing the regular agenda in terms of communication with the Sochi Organizing Committee.
Putin promised an ecological Olympics, his plan is to hunt down a giant secret dump
Winter sports fans are already cutting a meter before the opening of the Sochi Olympics, while others are looking at their preparations with increasing concern.
The Russian Olympics, though not due until February, are facing another scandal.
The Russians seem unable to keep their promise that the preparations and the holding of the games will not in the least disturb the nature of the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will be heading in four months.
After the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had the bar very high, and the Canadian Games went down in Olympic history as the most environmentally friendly.
However, it seems that Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to the zero-waste games has long since been fulfilled.
AP reporters last week discovered a huge construction dump in the village of Achshtyri near Sochi.
So a dump full of construction materials, tires, cans and insulation foams was found in August by environmentalists, who immediately reported it.
The Russian authorities went rogue and the dump disappeared.
Just for a little while.
Last week, reporters were given a glimpse of a dump the size of three football fields.
It is not the only one, but several have been established in the area, described the British newspaper The Times.
The Russian Railways, a state-owned monopoly, is building a 60-kilometer-long line between Sochi airport and the sports resort.
The enterprise, which has already swallowed 280 billion rubles, was run by one of Putin's close associates, Vladimir Yakunin.
In August, the railroad was arguing that the landfill was being built by one of its subcontractors.
The locals are desperate.
According to the residents of Achshitra, trucks full of waste materials have been driving around the village day and night for three months.
Experts fear that the waste will contaminate the local Mzymta River, other streams, and eventually the Black Sea.
"Water from here will contaminate Sochi's water sources for the next ten to 15 years", Vladimir Kimaev of the environmental nonprofit EWNC told the British newspaper.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem for the Russian organizing committee and government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
By comparison, the Sochi Games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing cost $43 billion.
Last year's London games cost only 19 billion and the Vancouver games cost 9 billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns about whether there will be enough snow in the end, there have also been reports of human rights violations at the exhibition of sports venues and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers shut his mouth to protest that he hadn't been paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers are abusing a new law that bans the promotion of homosexuality during the Games.
Some of the visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
Young couple old enough to live with their parents, new house offers privacy for both generations
A Japanese studio, Tai and Associates, was commissioned to design a house on a plot of land that lies on the corner of two streets, with the land itself somewhat sloping.
The request also stated that the house would be inhabited by two generations who would like to live together, but each would have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple needed a small office.
The house is on the corner of two streets and on a slightly sloping plot.
So the architects decided to place each household on one floor of the house.
"We have respected family ties, history and memories associated with the place in the design".
"The three different functions of the house are connected in several ways through the exterior of the building, so that everyone is aware of the presence of others but still has their privacy", explain the designers.
The parents' home is on the level of a garden with an old pine tree, which is associated with family traditions and memories.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, as they differ in the various final arrangements of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which has been shaped using panels of planks, the part where the office is located is plastered white and the remaining elements remain in a pure concrete construction without further modifications.
Many of the walls of the house are completely glazed, making the interior of the house very connected to the exterior.
The parents' home, more precisely the kitchen, dining room, and living room, surrounded a small garden with a tree that had great significance for the family.
The connection between the interior and the exterior is underlined by the side wall, which starts at the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enter the house through the main entrance of the hall and then climb the stairs to their quarters.
The stairs are the main dominating feature of the house's interior.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to cascade through.
This was the architects' attempt to set the house apart and to impress something unique upon it.
The young couple's home is treated as one open space with the kitchen, dining room, and living room all together.
The only partition between the terrace and the house is a glass wall with a sliding door.
A living area with a dining area and a kitchen in a young couple's home.
The second floor is composed as one large open space that freely crosses over to the terrace, from which there is a nice view of Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the top floor is painted in a pure combination of white and black.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enter the house through the main entrance, find themselves in the lobby, and then climb up the stairs.
Defend academic freedom, that goes for Zeman and ODS.
I have repeatedly in recent months issued open letters to students, teachers and the management of secondary and higher education institutions in several regions to defend academic freedom in the face of the election campaign being conducted in schools by President Milos Zeman.
I've met with more or less success.
The rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused to attend the lecture of the honorary president of the SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, was even retaliated for not being invited to celebrate the Czech Republic's state holiday.
Here is a list of representatives of schools that were no longer so brave and made the visit of Miloše Zeman possible: the Technical University in Brno, the Hladnov Gymnasium in Ostrava, the Business School in Ostrava, the Business Academy in Cologne, the University of J.E. Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
Now we are in Pardubice to meet the continuation of the policy-making in the universities.
The newly elected MP for ODS, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic position and, moreover, it seems normal to him.
Professor, it's really not the same as staying on as mayor of a small town.
You want to join the ChSSD, who are both MP and chief, and like them, downgrade both professions?
Because that's what you're telling people that they can handle both of these challenging left-back functions.
I know, we have an example of Michael Hasch here, who can even do a few dozen functions at once.
I don't think that's exactly the kind of person you should be following.
We also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánka Fraňková, who preferred to leave the post of MP so that she could fully devote herself to the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
But the main reason I recommend you leave the post of Dean is that you will violate the apolitical nature of the academic soil of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubican ODS sees your current work in both positions as an asset to the university.
But you can help "your" school without remaining dean.
I think that the same opinion as I and Rector Miroslav Ludwig, will be shared by your students.
So reconsider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, you might be counted by the voters in the next election.
And it doesn't have to be long.
In Kunovice bubbles, cabbage, they don't add chemicals to it
More than 1,000 tonnes of sour cabbage are to be produced in the coming months at Slovak Frutě Kunovice, which belongs to the Hamé food group.
The season here started in October and will last about six months.
They've been making a healthy treat here since 1925 in the traditional way, which is by stepping right into the big tanks.
It's a rarity in the modern industrial age.
Our workers will be on a nearly ten-mile shift.
Each of the ten tanks can hold 15 to 30 tons of cabbage, and it takes three shifts to fill one", said Slovak Fruit plant director David Kladroba.
The cabbage heads are transported to the company's premises directly from their fields by farmers, mainly from Ostrog and Breclav.
Fruit employees then clean the vegetables, remove the brooms, and throw them into the spinning wheel.
From there, the cut cabbage falls into the 20-foot-deep pools where whores in white robes and slippers work tirelessly.
They're used to push out unwanted air.
The last crushed cabbage layer is covered with a cloth and weighed with water.
"The green currant then matures for six to eight weeks under spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of fermentation-promoting substances", emphasized the director of Kladroba.
The natural process is similar to home production, with the workers sprinkling the layers with salt and cumin.
The cabbage is then fermented and travels to the filling line.
Packaged in an acidic solution in bags or glasses and sterilised.
Hamé supplies sour cabbage mainly to the domestic and Slovak markets.
Interest is also being shown in some other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Canada.
Snowden is willing to cooperate with Germany in connection with the US surveillance.
Edward Snowden, a US intelligence whistleblower, has announced that he is willing to travel to Berlin to hand over evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander are unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German lawmaker Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he had been granted asylum, on Thursday to discuss the possibility of witnessing in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, which the MP handed over to the media in Berlin on Friday, states: "Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat the opposition as fugitives and to try to criminalize political speech with heavy prosecutions that leave no room for defense".
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the United States government to drop the criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the United States Department of Justice include espionage and theft of government property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make it happen".
Tensions between the US and Germany began to rise after allegations surfaced that the NSA had been listening to Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the member of parliament who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence, said that if there was any opportunity to question Mr. Snowden as a witness without putting himself in danger and completely destroying relations with the US, it should be done.
Mr. Sträbele, a member of parliament for the German Green Party, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
Two German journalists accompanied him on his way to Russia.
Mr. Sträbele said that according to a former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he ever left.
If Mr. Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be "safe" there, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a harsh and persistent campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
But he said the world's reaction to his "act of political expression" had given him courage.
Citizens around the world and high-ranking officials, including those in the United States, have deemed the revelation of an unjustifiable system of pervasive surveillance a public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities until the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved.
We regret being killed, but we are innocent, Khmer Rouge officials defend
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
Under the Khmer Rouge, a combination of Maoism and nationalism, from 1975 to 1979, more than three million Cambodians - at least a quarter of the population - died from exhaustion, starvation, disease, torture, and execution.
The commander of the infamous S-21 prison was sentenced to life imprisonment by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing they were acting in the best interests of the nation and did not know the true extent of the killing.
"It's easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything and therefore intervened and corrected the situation", Khieu Samphan told the court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is, I had no authority", he added.
Nuon Chea stated that he never ordered the Khmer Rouge cadres to "misbehave or kill people, to deny them food or to commit genocide".
But he did admit to "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, the victims, their families, all the Cambodian people", he said.
Bin Sivla, 55, who lost 11 relatives under the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP she could not accept Nuon Che's apology.
"He lied to us".
"He only wants to be forgiven".
"He doesn't care about the other", she declared.
"If he hadn't given orders, his subordinates wouldn't have killed", she added, adding that the Khmer Rouge leaders were "worse than monsters".
The court was also to hear the case of the "foreign minister" of the Khmer Rouge regime, Ieng Sary, who died in March this year.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, was found incompetent to stand trial in September 2012 due to dementia.
Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is about to charge for carry-on baggage.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge an amount of up to USD 100 for carry-on baggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, though in its announcement Wednesday, it said passengers will be able to keep the entire can.
The new hand baggage charge applies to luggage in the upper storage area, so small baggage under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says it'll charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if the paying passengers wait until they get to the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee was meant to encourage passengers to make advance payments.
"We don't like to charge this fee", she said.
The airlines started charging for first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and to take as much of the hand luggage hidden in the storage space as they could, so that there was often no room in this space.
Fees are one way to teach passengers to take less stuff on board.
O'Malley said the whole point of this new fee isn't really to make more money.
The thing is, Frontier's most loyal customers have made it abundantly clear that finding a place in the top storage space is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company's website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in line at the Frontier gate can bring baggage for which he pays nothing, while the other passenger in line will pay $100 for the same baggage.
O'Malley said the website and checkout procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers are informed of the charge before they arrive at the gate.
The new hand luggage charge will not be applicable until the summer, but no date has been set.
Travelers often complain about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who request this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the additional baggage charge as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most of them didn't touch on the hand baggage charges.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge for carry-on baggage three years ago, and another low-cost carrier, Allegiant Air, followed suit.
The only company that charges the same is Wizz Air of Hungary, says airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who keeps a close eye on the additional charges.
In its December 2011 report, it estimated that the Spirit hand luggage fee would generate USD 50 million annually.
Sorensen, a former executive with Midwest Airlines, recently flew on Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when passengers encountered an unusual Spirit hand baggage charge.
"Getting on the plane was the most fluid thing I've ever seen in my flying career", he said.
I expected to see teeth-grinding and fighting at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, and boarding was in a flash.
Frontier will also charge for coffee, tea, soda and juice, following the example of Spirit.
Frontier said passengers who get lemonade or juice can keep the whole can, and the coffee will be refilled for free.
Water will continue to be free.
US Airways briefly tried to introduce a drink charge in 2008, but after complaints from passengers seven months later it backed down and no other major airline offered it.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet assessed the compatibility of the aid measure with the internal market.
Airlines pay online travel agents such as Orbitz between USD 10 and USD 25 per ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to direct passengers to buy directly from them instead of through online travel agents.
However, Frontier went the furthest in this area.
In September, it started giving customers who bought through an online travel agency only half the miles in the loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the mileage reward to 25 percent of the mileage.
So a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased through an online travel agency is a 250-mile reward.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make a purchase directly through Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in their hometown of Denver, but their business is beginning to shrink and losing money.
According to the financial results reported on Wednesday by business partner Republic Airways Holdings, sales fell by 9 percent and traffic capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter.
The sale of this airline is an attempt by Republic to solve the financial problems of Frontier.
The NSA doesn't blame the hackers for the website's downfall, but an "internal error"
The Secret National Security Agency said last Friday that its website was down for several hours last week due to an internal error, not a hacker attack, as some claimed online.
"The NSA.gov website was not accessible for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a regular update", the intelligence agency said in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be resolved during the evening.
The claim that the outage was caused by a DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server scanners recorded that the NSA website has been down for at least six hours, and the site remains inaccessible to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency's internal sensitive networks were not "in any way compromised".
The spokesman said no classified information was compromised.
At least one group of online hacker activists claimed responsibility for taking down NSA websites through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood target websites with information until the servers overload and the site crashes.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, once nicknamed No Agency, has become the focus of public attention and bitter criticism in recent months after a string of revelations of foreign and domestic surveillance programs - a product of the NSA's leaking of secret files from the agency and their disclosure by disillusioned former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has fueled earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier's profit fell as a result of a drop in supplies and orders
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier reported a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday, driven by lower orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, has also not disclosed any flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor has it offered any up-to-date information on whether this aircraft will comply with its ambitious plan to enter commercial service from next September.
After the initial test flight about a month and a half ago, the aircraft flew only three times, raising questions about whether the test phase was progressing well.
The results were not as predicted and the Toronto Stock Exchange fell 8 percent.
State-owned bank Cameron Doerksen on Thursday downgraded the rating from "higher yield" to "sector performance" with the expectation that the stock market will experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
'While we generally expected smaller aircraft deliveries, the profit margin in transport has been a major disappointment,' Doerksen said in a report to clients.
As the test program continues, we believe Bombardier will win new orders for the CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect market skepticism towards this programme to grow.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will break into the lower end of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and after months of delay, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding orders for CSeries aircraft is a modest 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flight to verify the company's claims regarding the low consumption and cost savings of this transport aircraft.
At present, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid measure with the internal market.
Senior executives also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was progressing as planned.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected", Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane's downtime.
Every manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the upgrade, and that's what we did.
That's going to happen throughout the flight program.
Bombardier says the second of the five test aircraft is due to take off in the coming weeks and the others shortly after.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first customer could start operating the CSeries 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier claims that it has evaluated its plan for the aircraft's entry into service and will provide updated information in the coming months.
This slow pace of flight tests  although in line with Bombardier's internal plan  is likely to reinforce our view that the start-up will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015, said Doerksen.
From USD 172 million, or 9 cents per share, in the previous year, Bombardier's net profit fell to USD 147 million, or 8 cents per share, in the third quarter ending 30 September.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnover decreased marginally from USD 4,2 billion to USD 4,1 billion.
According to the Thomson Reuters IBES, analysts expected a return of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer stated that it had delivered only 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared to 57 aircraft a year earlier.
Net orders have dropped from 83 planes to 26.
Aircraft division outstanding orders were $32.9 billion as of September 30, which is unchanged as of December 31.
"The results in aviation were in line with our prospects, but the low order intake and the overall state of the market disappointed us", said Beaudoin.
Revenues in the aviation industry fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, said that revenue in the division rose by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Outstanding transport contracts amounted to 32,6 billion on 30 September, a marginal increase compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the execution of several large contracts.
The managers indicated that new prospects will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier shares, which also announced the arrival of Google CFO Patrick Pichette, fell 8.5 percent to $4.83 during trading on Thursday afternoon.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest competitor, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly earnings on Thursday.
The cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned the mobster about a police investigation is in jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, was supposed to pass information to the King of the Underworld, Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was afraid his drug addiction would come out.
Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top defense attorney who informed a drug mafia about a major police investigation, fearing his drug addiction would come out, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was supposed to pass sensitive information to the underworld boss Neil Scarbrough about the investigation into his drug-smuggling activities after he became suspected of using cocaine.
The lawyer, nicknamed Bash (party) and hailed by criminals as the best lawyer, was arrested at his home in 2011 after police tracked down Scarborough, whom he had represented in previous narcotics cases.
Police spotted Sarborough, 32, leaving three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, where he was having dinner with his law firm colleagues.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation revealed that Ditta was a regular user of Class A drugs.
During an eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he quietly sought information on the arrests of two men in favour of Scarborough and his accomplice.
All four suspects were being tracked at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After police seized around £1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine during a series of raids, along with £200,000 in cash, 32 others ended up in prison with them.
Ditta, 42, passed information to criminals for fear of being exposed to cocaine addiction.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors, a Blackburn-based law firm, experienced a shameful moment at Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty of obstructing justice in two cases after a three-week trial.
He admitted to possession of cocaine at an earlier hearing.
The lawyer's fall came after police investigation into Scarborough revealed that he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and spotted him placing a 60 percent purity drug under the lawyers' basket in a black golf glove.
Scarborough was then in regular telephone conversation with Ditta, who was having dinner at Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, where he found the drugs, and there were nine conversations between the two men.
It was reported in court that traces of class A drugs were found in his hair, wallet and credit cards and that Ditta was a "regular cocaine user".
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, and said he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation fell within "confidential communication".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards, but they were all intercepted and his hair samples were taken.
During police interrogation, he said that he had an office at both his home and workplace addresses and that clients visited him at home for business.
But the court heard that after key arrests, he contacted major players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, to tell them what detectives knew about them.
The prosecutor, Anne Whyte, said: "No one knows better than a criminal lawyer that he must not break the law".
Mr. Ditta is charged with misuse of his position as counsel and getting too close to a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations were undoubtedly legitimate, because he was his lawyer.
But it went way beyond the usual lawyer-client relationship.
He disrupted the police investigation as much as he could to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta has not brought his profession good repute, but rather disgraced it.
He's gotten too close to some of his clients, especially Scarborough, and he's allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied the offence and stated: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to pass information to Mr Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately".
However, after the hearing, Lancashire Police Inspector Lee Halstead said: "Mr Ditta went from being a criminal lawyer to a criminal himself when he started procuring drugs from organised criminals".
His cocaine addiction left him hopelessly weak and vulnerable to the intentions of the top organized crime figures who tasked him with gathering valuable information for police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and must inspire confidence and a sense of trust in the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organised Crime Unit has conducted an investigation into Mr Ditt, which has also led to his conviction on three counts of possession of cocaine and now one count of obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing the perpetrators to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another 35 people involved in the trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug offenses.
On his website, Ditta conducted an online interview about himself, in which he said that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from death row in America, that he would wish Muhammad Ali as a dinner guest, and cited inequality as a motivation for his work.
He negotiated the government with Klaus and Spidol.
Now the people of Jan Kasala have sent against Babiš.
The People's Party won 14 seats, or only a third of the number of Social Democrats or ANO representatives.
But they enter government negotiations with at least one advantage.
The team, which has already begun to discuss the outlines of a possible coalition, includes Jan Kasala, a man who, as a populist, negotiated the terms of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
The Social Democrats and Andrej Babiš don't have such a matador on their side.
I think this time it will be like the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"The experience was minimal", Kasal estimates, "as to how the talks will unfold this year".
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"It is a scary news and it is fitting to ask what will prevent Parliament from simply undermining the independence of the judiciary tomorrow", newspapers said, calling the bill unconstitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it", said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will hear us out and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the House", he said.
According to the Star, the bill effectively gives the government "full control over the media", and the Standard newspaper reports that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have been hit hard, criticizing the bill as "harsh".
The bill's passage comes amid a series of measures aimed at bolstering national security immediately after the September Islamic shooter attack at the Westgate shopping mall.
The Kenyan media reversed the anger of the authorities by broadcasting a security camera footage of soldiers sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looting a luxury goods store.
The police chief responded by summoning two journalists and a senior media official for questioning, but the summons was later withdrawn under pressure from the media.
Under the new draft law, media companies could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, along with the risk of being "de-listed" or being denied official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to seize the offender's property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, even one fine is enough to shut down most radio stations.
It is also stated that these measures may have a liquidating effect on what is called the Kenyan 'living blogosphere'.
Politicians know that if they shut down the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"You never know what might happen", wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist for the Nation newspaper, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of the system of mutual control and balance in public life.
"If we leave it to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and throw us back into hunting and gathering", he wrote.
Kenya's lawmakers have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to lift the cuts ordered by the National Pay Agency and to restore their fat wages of some 532,000 shillings a month, which is among the highest in the world.
They have to save up, young Czechs know.
But most of them have no idea what interest rates
More and more Czechs are putting their money aside.
Still, they're not reaching the regional savings champions.
The Austrians save the most money, saving an average of $181 a month.
People in Slovakia save a little more than the Czechs.
This is according to a survey by Erste Savings Barometer in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
It also found that the mood of the spenders is improving, and two thirds of those surveyed plan to save more money.
While the Czechs are in the middle of the ranking of savers, in Romania and Serbia, savers still use very little.
For example, nearly one in two Serbs is studying saving "under the pillow" at home.
The number of people who save more money each month has increased in the country this year.
Last year, 26 percent of respondents saved between $1,000 and $2,000 each month for various types of savings, and this year, the figure is up five percent.
However, the average monthly deposit has fallen slightly to CZK 2,078 compared to the previous year.
The biggest hit among savings products is pension insurance.
This is the preferred method of saving for 54% of Czechs, whereas three years ago it was the preferred method of saving for only 36% of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of building savings is declining, and interest in investment funds has also fallen sharply compared with last year.
Only 16 percent of respondents now use them, compared with almost a quarter last year.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to save, most do not know what they are getting back on each product.
Especially young people, who don't know how their money is being paid interest until they're 30.
In contrast, the oldest group of people surveyed are the most aware of the return on their savings, with 73 percent of those over 50 saying so.
In an international comparison, Erste Czech Republic leads in the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of the population.
The Slovaks and Austrians follow with a 12 percent margin.
The UN celebrates new goals for poverty reduction
The United Nations is immediately starting work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were introduced 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which kicked off overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for the 'Sustainable Development Goals', which are to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said overnight at the summit that now was the time to "put national interests first".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to implement the general SDG objectives", he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which builds on the success of the MDGs.
Concerns for the security of Mozambique are rising over the conflict of powerful figures
Under the statue of Samora Machela, Mozambique's founding president, thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo to chant peace slogans in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability", said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of the investment firm.
Fearing for her country's future, she traded her business attire for a T-shirt decorated with the words "We demand safety" in Portuguese and joined the crowd in Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, almost daily reports came in of clashes between government forces and the Renamo party, one of the worst since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was a once infamous rebel movement, initially supported by the white government of Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the independent government of that country.
After the peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that open conflict is unlikely to re-emerge in the country, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals alike.
The economy is growing rapidly, for the discovery of vast offshore oil and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies like Brazil's Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy's Eni, and the United States' Anadarko.
The ruling party Frelimo, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension.
Renamo claims that the government provoked the latest conflicts by launching an attack on its members in Sofala province, the traditional stronghold of Renamo Party, on 17 September.
The violent assault by the former rebels then culminated when government forces attacked the Renamo party base and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakam, the group's leader, Renamo party spokesman Fernando Mazanga told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for starting the conflict, because it allegedly attacked the soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to ease fears of instability.
Mr Guebuza told France's AFP news agency on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "loser" who wanted to use "anything left of his power to try to prove that he can dictate his own decisions to the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
But concerns were raised when Mr Mazanga's words were quoted that Renamo was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with seriousness", said Mr. Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions between the parties, fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
It's a feud between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said Open University lecturer and Mozambique expert Joseph Hanlon.
Neither is a good negotiator, and neither is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which has been pushing for electoral reforms, has already expressed that it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an attempt by the dying movement to gain advantages and financial gains from the government.
The electoral share of the Renamo party has been declining since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by a former member of the Renamo party, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza, who is finishing his second term next year, wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democratic system, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency", Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options the Renamo party has, but it has carried out devastating terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south road.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometers from the capital Maputo, but where the city of Beira is located, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on for their coal exports.
In June, Rio suspended the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the line.
Mr. Mazanga declined to comment on whether Renamo would repeat its threat.
Renamo wanted to warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good, Mazanga said.
The instability has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also worried about corruption, slow development and the recent spate of kidnappings.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies solely with the government and the president and that he should be the one to find solutions to the problems", he says.
Protester Omar Sultuane says the people just want stability.
"Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads", he says.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "models for a way of life", says the author.
The stories of Thor may show that brute force cannot equal cunning cunning, while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Many of the myths would be "too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene" to teach in school, said Crossley-Holland, who pleads for a careful selection of age-appropriate works.
"I think it's great that myths and folk art are now part of education", he said.
I've been defending this plan for 20 years.
He added that the open-minded authors and teachers are at the heart of the story with a "underlying" message for children as a "switch".
Crossley-Holland, who translated the epic Beowulf from English and who also writes the Penguin Book and the British National Anthem, says: "You may have good intentions, but you do better if you keep them to yourself".
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need for some sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end happy endings, but there has to be a natural sense of right and wrong.
And it has to be subconscious; revealed through the story, not openly established.
The old truth about showing is better than describing.
The Brno Observatory will take visitors into space in a new digital
At first glance, it's obvious that the hall of the great planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can sit in new comfortable seats, and a 17-meter-diameter dome-shaped projection surface has been added above their heads by the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the room is the most important part, the new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, there are other smaller projectors scattered throughout the room.
Another important part of the whole facility is hidden behind the hall walls.
"It's 21 computers that generate the image", said the director of the Brno Observatory, Jiří Dušek.
Computers ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but is integrated.
"Computers are 30 to 40 times more powerful than conventional personal computers", noted astronomer Tomáš Hladík.
The digital can create an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body, or the ocean floor.
The audience finds itself in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Another similar facility is nearest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The studio's management plans to show the purchased shows in the auditorium as well as their own production.
There are two shows on the schedule starting Saturday.
The first one is called Astronaut, and it's for adults.
It's where people learn about astronaut training, go to space, spin on centrifuges, and then see first-hand the challenging conditions astronauts face in space.
The second show is for kids and it's called Magic Reef - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a reef whose colorful inhabitants lived peaceful lives until the moment when a nearby volcano erupted.
The entire digitization cost about 50 million crowns, paid for mostly by the Ministry of Education.
The City of Brno and the Observatory also contributed smaller amounts from their budget.
The projection board cost 10 million crowns, the projector 12 million.
"The rest was taken up by audiovisual technology and computers", Dušek explained.
The installation of the digital room followed the reconstruction of the entire building that the observatory underwent two years ago.
According to Director Duška, there could be 25,000 to 30,000 visitors by the end of the year.
We studied 11 thousand views!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis detected more than 11,000 job advertisements, of which 4,300 were published in daily newspapers and 6,800 (62%) online.
The Internet is thus becoming the most important medium for posting job offers.
Back in 2005, when the survey was first conducted, it was 26 percent.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010) it stood at around 60%.
The analysis shows that the advertisement of job opportunities reflects to a large extent the current situation on the labour market.
An example would be a simple comparison of the number of advertisements published during a period of economic prosperity and during an economic crisis.
For example, in 2007 almost 25 900 advertisements were published during the same period, compared to less than half in 2012.
The job offer on the Internet is geared towards a narrower, and in particular more qualified, group of professions.
By contrast, the daily press offers a wider range of jobs, including those of working class workers, said the author of the analysis, Pavlína Šťastnová.
The degree of representation of selected professional groups is different in the two media.
Advertisements for managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers, and financial experts have taken the lead on the Internet.
The position of programmers or small business leaders figured only on the Internet.
The proportion of these professions in the daily press is much lower, but the service and labour professions are particularly represented.
Of course, the most frequently cited requirements that employers express through the tender offer are those relating to education.
Other areas of study included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement of knowledge of a foreign language was mentioned in three percent of the advertisements, on the Internet in 37 percent.
Only 2% of advertisements required employers to have an active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims of 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 percent of advertisements (11 percent in daily print, 57 percent on the Internet).
Experience was required in 54% of the advertisements.
The practical requirements are closely linked to qualified professions.
These are in particular production managers and other senior management.
The occupations of workers are mainly mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of foodstuffs or repairers of electrical appliances, added study author Jiří Tillner.
Employers also list requirements for the qualities and skills of potential applicants in half of their advertisements.
Communication skills have long been the most frequently requested skills in advertising.
Employers also demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, autonomy, responsibility, organisational skills and reliability.
The 10th anniversary of the New York comedy festival, the New Yorker, is a great time to be a comedian.
New York City may be said to be the birthplace of the comic solo act in America: nearly a century ago, the variety performer Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of the ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes to the assembled crowd by the method of conversation.
Fay's innovation has spread over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival, founded and run by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines solo comedy institution, is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year with more than 60 performances in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these titles have appeared in the Carolinas and have become so successful that they are too big to play in a club", Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wandy Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes", the annual musical comedy benefit show at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
As the festival expanded, so did the world of comedy.
Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival have emerged from non-traditional channels, such as shows on smaller radio or television companies such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has made his mark with his sitcom (the funniest "League" on FXX's fantasy-football theme) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a cast member on both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, but she is most famous for the fast-moving series Marcel the shell with shoes on.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognizable voices (the surrealistically pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the voracious, racially oriented W. Kamau Bell), are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest highlights of the festival will be an interview with David Steinberg and Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting is at Town Hall in midtown Manhattan.
"This town is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work", Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks down the alley between two buildings and thinks, "Man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here".
Oil prices have dropped further to $96 a barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about high supplies were balanced by a report that showed a strengthening of China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector.
The U.S. oil index for December deliveries fell in late morning European e-commerce on the New York Stock Exchange by 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel.
It was down 39 cents on Thursday and 5.8 percent for the month of October.
The abundance of oil has been weighing on the price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. inventories have increased by 4.1 million barrels in the past week.
In five weeks, the stockpile has increased by more than 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday, two reports on Chinese production gave a boost to higher demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth, which rebounded to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after the previous two weak decades.
Brent crude, the international oil index also used by U.S. refiners, dropped 26 cents at $108.58 a barrel on the London International Trade Exchange.
No, not that, Mr. Hush.
We have a unique opportunity to tell the politicians that this is not the way.
We need to put pressure on Martin Hašek to be stripped of all political functions and to leave the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already so flimsy.
Martin Hašek is protected by the promise he has made, but everyone and politicians in particular must be aware of the consequences of a given promise and carefully consider what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital a politician has (Mr. Babiš has the material capital, but the question is whether he is a politician).
The self-righteous agenda promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
In politics, you don't apologize, you step back.
Mr. Hush, if you mean well to this country (and your frequent statements confirm me in this, unless you've just been lying - here you see how difficult it is with lying), you'll leave politics alone, a man.
People will then take your apology as an expression of a man who made a mistake and takes responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a backward weakling whose words and actions cannot be trusted.
You either want to be a proud, flawed man or a lifelong scumbag.
It may seem unfair to you that I am speaking only to you, but you are the leaders and they are the lost sheep.
And you're the leader you always wanted to be.
I understand you're trying to turn a blind eye, regroup your forces, endure the shame and then attack again, but that's what partisans or traitors do.
You are, I repeat, in your own eyes, the leader, the alpha male, so act like it.
Take responsibility and leave politics.
The court blocked the order regarding the procedure for stopping and searching persons by the NYPD.
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a court order requiring changes to the police department's arrest and search program and dismissed the judge's case.
The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision will be stayed pending the city's decision on the appeal.
A judge ruled in August that the city violated the Constitution by implementing its program of stopping and interrogating people.
The city challenged its findings and its corrective regulations, including the decision to assign oversight to help the police department change its procedures and its related training program.
The appeals court heard arguments for the requested stay on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal said that the judge must be dismissed from the case because she had come into conflict with the rules of conduct for judges by not acting as a judge as required to avoid appearances of sympathy, in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she openly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unfairly targeting blacks and Hispanics as part of their arrest and search program.
It established an independent oversight body to oversee major changes, including reforms in procedures, training and surveillance, and ordered the launch of a pilot programme to test body-worn cameras in some of the most frequent areas of arrest.
In August, New York City agreed to end the method of keeping names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after a police search.
Oral justification of the appeal by the City is scheduled for sometime after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching people have been criticized by many civil rights activists.
There have been stops and searches in some form for decades, but the number of recorded searches under independent mayor Michael Bloomberg has increased dramatically to a record 684,330 in 2011, mostly of blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of whom are minorities, filed a lawsuit that became a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-search program argue that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and efficiency of the police force, and may affect how these practices are used by other police departments.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale but not crime, and that it will waste money, but will not solve the broader problem of the police force being under pressure after its numbers have shrunk by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of stopping and searching persons, which is constitutional, but reformed the way the NYPD has implemented searches.
One in five shopping centres are experiencing low traffic
This is according to data from real estate consultancy firms Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
The Krakow Shopping Centre is opened to the public in Bohnice, Prague, as Prague's 19th shopping centre.
There are now a total of 90 large shopping centres in the Czech Republic.
The unsatisfactory performance is about 20 percent of medium and large centers.
The main problems are insufficiently large centres and poor layouts, i.e. too many floors or complicated and unclear layout of passages, or dead centres", said Michal Soták of Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to Sylvie Samadi, head of retail real estate at Jones Lang LaSalle, about one fifth of shopping malls are experiencing low traffic.
The main reasons include poor transport availability, low income categories of local residents or over-saturation of the market in a given place.
Some projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were mainly unsatisfactory at first.
Today's customers are somewhat conservative and reluctant to change their shopping habits.
New shopping centres must do more to 'lure' their customers to new brands in the market, entertainment, services and marketing campaigns,' added Samadi.
According to Soták, the occupancy of shopping centres is generally stable, even rising in some centres, because the landlords were willing to discount the rent and sublet some units during the crisis.
"It is true that some projects have recently opened that are not fully occupied and thus reduce the average occupancy (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Shantovka in Olomouc)", Soták added.
The shopping centres opened in the last two years are moving very slowly in the market, according to Sylvie Samadi.
But there is a market for new projects.
The number of sites suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see a space for the construction of a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinience centres', focused on purchases and daily services for the population living in the immediate vicinity,' said Samadi.
According to Soták, there is also room on the domestic market for additional shopping centres.
This is true for small service centres, for large projects in Prague, or for medium-sized projects, or for expansion in regional cities.
"Cities like Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth", Soták added.
In Prague, he sees a space for a shopping center being prepared on Vítězny Square, furthermore, according to him, Na Příkopě and Václavské Square have a clear potential.
"The expansion of retail parks is developing intensively, allowing traders to cover and expand into smaller and smaller cities at favorable rental and operating costs, and space is still available in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centres, or their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of Prior commercial houses, which benefit from a good location", added Dita Kubánková from DTZ.
The Czech Republic currently has 90 modern shopping centres with a total gross leasable area of more than 2,2 million m2.
A quarter of all these shopping centres are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centres, according to the number of tenants, nine are in Prague, according to Incoma GfK.
In terms of the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to the values in the UK and France, the Czech Republic lags behind by about 50 square metres per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson hacked into the phone to verify the tip
Former News of the World (NotW) editor Andy Coulson allegedly used phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation to confirm a false tip about a romantic relationship involving then-Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis at the Old Bailey said the News of the World caught a false report in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper had assigned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and penetrate her privacy, but it was reported in court that Coulson had also called her and left her voice messages.
"The prosecutor suggests that Mr. Coulson, now editor of NotW, is not a man who stands outside his house hoping to catch people outside, but a man who likes to summarize people's stories to see what they say", Mr. Edis said.
He said that NotW used three methods to investigate stories: hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
He obviously knows about the other one, the surveillance, he must know about it.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says no, we say, "But of course he knows".
Rumors of Clarke's involvement in a romantic relationship were first picked up by the NotW newsroom when a source who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby was told, "You're wasting your time, she's with Charles".
The voice-message recording taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on the private investigator's computer where Ms. Pawlby and her sister were identified as "Projects".
During the time Mrs. Pawlby was under investigation, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the tracking of Mrs. Pawlby's movements.
On 18 June 2005, Coulson left her a voice message saying: "I have received a story that we are going to publish tomorrow and that I would very much like to discuss with Charles".
Mr. Edis says Coulson's involvement in the story was modeled after other high-profile figures, including former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
It was reported in court on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett about his affair with a married woman while he was seeing his co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied conspiring with other individuals to hack into phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have confessed to hacking into the phone.
The NSA's exposure is fueling social paranoia about state surveillance.
One quiet day in late August, a German police helicopter buzzed over the American consulate in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
The mission was ordered by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, to take photographs of the roof of the American forward patrol station, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media reports say the BfV hoped to identify the presence of the listening antennas, and this action triggered an exchange of views between the US and German foreign ministers in Berlin.
James Clapper, the U.S. director of national intelligence, reiterated in September that the United States is not using its foreign intelligence capabilities to "steal trade secrets from foreign companies for the benefit of American companies, thereby enhancing their international competitiveness or increasing their profits".
But since Edward Snowden, who went from collaborator to informant, began to reveal his valuable collection of secret surveillance by the United States, European governments and leading businessmen are no longer sure whether to believe the director's words.
After reports that the US National Security Agency was spying on Brazilian oil companies and gaining access to data held by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, the general paranoia about state surveillance has reached new dimensions.
The latest news comes with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone has been tapped for perhaps a decade.
If he can be targeted by the most powerful person in Europe, then surely the top businessmen are also potential targets.
Snowden made clear the intense cooperation between American intelligence agencies and corporations.
I'd say it's possible that these data are being used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up", said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey published in July by the consultancy EY, German companies are convinced that the US now poses as great a risk as China in terms of industrial espionage and data theft.
But in all the documentation Mr. Snowden has uncovered, so far, there is no evidence that the United States has passed trade secrets from foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks some IT and Internet capabilities and said it should try to reduce its dependence on the US:
The top businessmen are skeptical.
There are voices in the German parliament that we should make a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
That's not the way, says Hasso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP.
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn't have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
The scale and technical sophistication of the US spy agencies exposed by Snowden is shocking to some companies who have previously believed that China is the greatest threat to surveillance.
There is a big shift in cloud computing, where European officials have more broadly realized that data stored in the US is under US jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of non-U.S. members canceled plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after the discovery of the U.S. Prism data mining program.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP's CEO's, says, "We have this new question for customers that wasn't here a year ago - where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will stay in this jurisdiction physically?"
Many high-ranking German officials argue that the latest news is just confirmation of what they already knew: that the powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and that this data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is being conducted is no surprise.
It always does.
"This has been a key topic for many years and has not changed significantly during the current debate", says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF agrochemicals.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we are spying on them, because it is in our national interest to protect our businesses.
Business leaders generally do not want to brag about the countermeasures they have taken to prevent the attacker from gaining an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB flash drive to a trade fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of the carmaker Audi, says that for many years it has been common practice to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as eavesdropping devices.
The German BfV advises managers to consider not using simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad because of the risk of smuggling.
The prepaid cell phones are then thrown away.
However, there is concern that SMEs will remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are leading global players in their specific areas.
SMEs often lack the expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their business secrets from unauthorised access, warns the BfV in its report.
The United States is warning its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, the National Intelligence Estimate documents listed France in February as the second perpetrator of hacking activities for economic intelligence agencies, after Russia and Israel, and just behind China.
A board member at a German hedge fund has concluded that when it comes to economic espionage, the French are the worst.
Bernard Squarcini, former head of France's domestic intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview this month: "The agencies know full well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies".
The parents of a minor boy from Georgia who died in a freak accident believe he was murdered
The parents of a young boy from Georgia whose body was found inside a wrestling spirit in his high school gymnasium believe their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found dead in a mental institution on January 11th, behind the gymnasium of his high school.
Sheriff's investigators from Lowndes County have concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of the 17-year-old boy denies it.
"They are absolutely convinced that their son was murdered", said attorney Benjamin Crump, who represents Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said he did.
"They believe it goes against logic, the laws of physics and common sense", Crump said.
They think it's to cover up what really happened, to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school as usual, and he came back in a body bag", he said.
State's Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he was leading the ongoing investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there is sufficient basis for a normal investigation", he said.
Moore told reporters that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson died as a result of postural asphyxiation.
But the second autopsy, according to Moore, gave a different cause of death.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed", he said.
Moore added that if Johnson's death case reveals enough evidence to warrant an investigation into a crime or civil rights violation, he'll ask the FBI to execute it.
A deputy for the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not immediately available for comment Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all the surveillance footage that investigators have reviewed.
The teen's parents are hoping the video footage will contain a clue that will lead to the discovery of how their son died.
The CDC issued a guideline for schools regarding allergies in children .
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a set of guidelines to help with school-aged food allergies.
This is the first set of such guidelines issued by the U.S. government, and it is because of the increasing number of school-age children who suffer from food allergies.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools on how to make teachers and staff aware of children's food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction, if it occurs.
It also recommends that schools have adrenaline  most commonly an EpiPen  auto-injector to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State lawmakers recently updated rules that make it easier for schools to store adrenaline.
The report also lists the typical symptoms seen in interviews with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child may say: "It's like someone's poking me in the tongue", "I feel like I have hair on my tongue", or "My tongue is prickling me".
Parents of intersex children can choose an "indefinite sex"
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex in children born with an ambiguous sex identity.
Newborn babies will no longer be classified as either male or female.
The new law does not require parents to state any gender for such children and allows them to state the gender on their birth certificates as undefined or unspecified.
The purpose of the law is to stop the pressure on parents to rush their child into sex-determination surgery and to fight discrimination against those who are intersex.
One intersex person told the BBC many years later: "I am neither man nor woman".
I'll remain a doctor-created lettuce, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that one out of every 2,000 babies is born each year, neither a boy nor a girl.
They're intersex, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall under the diagnosis of sexual developmental disorders, an umbrella term for those with atypical chromosomes, sex glands (ovaries or testes) or abnormally developed genitals.
The intersex could have been Wallis Simpson.
Gender determination is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information and determine it, rather than waiting and monitoring the child's psychological and physical development until surgery, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender issues, said the new German law "seems like a good thing".
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children are not", he said.
Sex can be determined without surgery and then you can wait for identity to develop.
Knowledge of how a child develops in terms of sex is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
A report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not tied to gender but to their biological make-up, which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either.
These traits may be manifested in secondary sex characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, breasts and figure, in primary sex characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination experienced by intersex and transgender people in the workplace, as well as levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't fit any gender are now in a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to indicate their male, female or third sex in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, 52, from Australia, became the world's first gender-neutral person in June when she won a court appeal to retain her gender-neutral status for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will have a third mark, X, for intersex people, in addition to M (male) and F (female).
In neighboring France, according to a news report on France 24, the issue of gender is still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers in this heavily Catholic country signed a petition to remove "gender theories" from school textbooks.
The American Catholic Online website also took a stand against the German law, writing: "As the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a matter of choice but sexual activity is not, we are upending two more pillars of civilization".
A newborn mother in Maryland also told the Baby Zone that she would prefer to see her children assigned a sex at birth.
"Parenting itself is stressful without any other restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child", she told the parenting website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, babies of both sexes were called hermaphrodites, after the handsome Greek who was bisexual.
And for about a decade back, the medical community believed that gender was like a blackboard that could be erased and redrawn.
But now many are questioning the ethical basis of surgery, saying that gender is a complex issue and that doctors can sometimes make the wrong decisions because they don't know how their children will feel when they grow up.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency", Drescher said.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
A persistent theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sex was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that sex is submissive.
He created a new notion of "gender", arguing that social causes and environmental influences, how parents raised their children, affected the child's genes and hormones, and shaped the child regardless of whether it was identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as "John/Joan", his theory became controversial.
He recommended that the parents of a boy whose penis had been damaged by a badly performed circumcision have their child completely neutered, have his testicles removed, and raise him as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different", said Drescher.
When the boy was 15, he had surgery to revert to a boy and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors still use this model today.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these operations emerged dissatisfied with the outcome.
So was Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes but an ambiguous sex identity.
The doctors weren't sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man he could never live a satisfying life.
And so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce had his external organs and testicles surgically removed and was raised as a girl.
At 12, he got female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl", he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
At 18, he was sent for vaginal plastic.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrifying.
I was sterilized after birth and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to allow its sexual system to develop properly.
After he found out the truth, he turned back into a man, took testosterone doses, had his breasts removed,
The surgery caused his infertility.
Today, he represents others in an organization called the Interface Project, which seeks to normalize the perception of those who are intersex.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the California-based legal group Advocates for informed choice, worries that the German law "is challenging labeling and stigma".
"Many activists fear that the German law will achieve the goal of encouraging parents to make quick decisions and choose the uncertain for their child", she said.
We're afraid it will prompt an intervention.
We think it's better to assign a male or female and then wait.
But we don't know what the law will turn out to be, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports the Australian law because it allows adults to choose to be classified as third sex.
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about the legal gender", she said.
German law is about to assign it at birth.
That's a battle a little kid shouldn't be fighting at this point.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based chest radiologist who has a daughter with a developmental disability and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said that German law gives powers to both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a DSD called androgen-insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are defective, Katie has developed feminine traits.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.
Now 29, Katie is married and is an intern in child psychiatry while studying at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
"The law gives parents some leeway to not rush their decisions", said Baratz.
It gives them time to run certain tests and think about it and it gives them time before they write "man" or "woman".
In this respect, it's all right. You're raising your child and you love him.
You have a wonderful child and you're so happy for him.
You don't have to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
"It gives the child the opportunity to be involved in the decision-making process and takes away the anxiety that parents have because they are not sure they are doing the right thing", she said.
Eventually, the child decides which sex he or she is more likely to identify with, and that's a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
A drunkard poured gasoline all over the house, threatening to burn it down with his family!
The tension was rising, the fear was rising.
The man started threatening to burn the whole house down.
Therefore, all available police patrols in the area were deployed, as well as a fire brigade from Mladá Boleslav and a unit of the volunteer fire brigade.
A police negotiator arrived at the scene to try to excuse the man's irrational behavior.
The man continued to threaten to burn the house down.
So a task force must have broken into the house, disarmed the man and tied him up.
The assailant then ended up being examined at the Młodobeleslav Hospital, from where he was transferred to the Alcohol Control Station.
The firefighters eventually sprayed the house with sorbent, which was later cleaned.
All the animals were rescued from the house, except the people.
The man didn't want to talk to the police, so the command went after him.
Report: Obama's campaign was considering replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest adviser, according to the New York Times, was secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 presidential race.
This revelation is the most significant sensation in the eagerly awaited book on the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann Double down: Game Change 2012.
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday night that the president's top aides were holding intensive group meetings and polls in late 2011 to assess whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama's fading re-election hopes.
According to national-political correspondent for the Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials within the campaign and at the White House, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to gauge the impact of former Secretary of State Clinton's election to the vice presidency.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only a few of the president's closest advisers, including Daley, former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe, knew that this change was being considered.
The book Double Down claims that Daley was the front-runner for the bid to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make the move when data showed that adding Clinton to the nomination would not substantially improve Obama's chances.
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden Clinton.
"I've been doing a lot of research, and this was one of them", he told the Daley.
You must remember that the president had terrible prospects at the time, so we were like, "Jesus Christ, what are we going to do?"
While Daley characterized the research as "care necessary", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to see if the move would pay off in the election.
"You don't spend that much money on campaigns and quality research unless you really think about something", Martin told AC360.
It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was considering the exchange.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his then boss knew about this potential shuffling.
While Daley said he didn't think the president was aware of the potential changes, the former chief of staff admitted it was possible that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double Down" definitely doesn't answer the question of whether the political probe got to Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the research that removed Biden from the race.
"Maybe", said Martin.
The fantastic ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur made the first ice cream that glows in the dark using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of this sea creature to develop a glowing candle.
He got the idea after reading a paper on jellyfish, and he convinced scientists in China to chemically make a protein that causes light to shine.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer's tongue  raising the pH level of the protein and subsequently causing it to radiate.
Chris says that ice cream glows when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, and that's why the more you lick it, the brighter it glows.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious", says: "It's a wonderful substance, but in terms of production, we're just getting started, so for £200 you get about 2g of this substance".
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth heats up the protein, the pH level goes up, and the ice cream starts to glow.
We've been testing it for the last few months, and it seems like a great idea for a Halloween celebration, because it creates this fantastic glow effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because glowing jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
And so each pile costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes great.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
His next product is even more ambitious.
He says, "I really wish I could make invisible ice cream".
It's essentially impossible because of the light fracture caused by the ice crystals that make the ice cream, but I'm hoping that we'll find some way to do that.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially made by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat candy, stay up late, and show off to the neighbors in costumes.
Today I feel like I've become a screwball.
I haven't had a candy bar in my apartment in two years, and this year probably won't be any different.
But the statistics show that when it comes to Halloween, I'm a black sheep.
According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), this year the majority of Americans - in fact, 158 million - will celebrate Halloween, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes, and decorations.
But what I always look forward to on Halloween is trends.
According to NRF, 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent is expected to go to costumes.
This year's latest fashion show is sexy inanimate objects.
It's not just women anymore; it's food like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.
As for the men, I expect we'll see a lot of zombies with the parade of the dead, and I bet the space men from Daft Punk will be bringing it to our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with following tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes, and to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes, according to the NRF.
So he's gonna see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don't waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans spend $1.9 billion.
That's about 300 million pounds of Hershey's, lollipops, milk duds and Twizzlers and a Clark bar.
That's great news for the 41 million callers who the U.S. Department of Commerce says are about to storm our neighborhood.
In fact, we're going to buy, and believe it or not, we're going to consume, on Halloween, 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Candy Association, nearly 16,000 tons of it is sold around Halloween.
That's about nine billion individual corn candies.
That's a secret I never solved.
Nothing more Halloween-y than haunted houses.
They have the best names like "Terror behind the walls", "Howl-O-Scream", and "The house of shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially dedicated haunted houses in the United States, which, according to the Haunted House Association of America, are making $500 million, and that includes those amazing photos of you pissing your fear off that your friend posts on Facebook, and you can't delete them, and the person you like, they look at the photo and they comment like, "Haunted Faces".
And finally, a little bit about pumpkins.
Ever since we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin, and carving pumpkin lanterns is like decorating a Christmas tree. We've been doing it since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the baby in the pumpkin trend didn't start until last year with Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting out the pumpkin instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
The pumpkin lantern with the shimmering flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkins have been grown this year.
If you're looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try cutting up their pumpkin weighing almost a ton.
The Land Rover racing series is announced
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts as well as intercom.
Options include improved brakes, a service package that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between plants.
Drew Bowler, technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said, "The race participants who come to Bowler have changed".
Not all are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also an accessible path to world-class racing.
We are delighted to offer them this route in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience the different racing disciplines in the UK and overseas, and that it will prepare competitors for the hardness and reality of Rally Raid racing.
We've really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge car. It's going to be a really exciting competition.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
We have an early election in two years.
Top 09 chairman Karel Schwarzenberg is expecting another early election soon.
A week after the last ones, in an interview with Aktuálně.cz, he said that there is no other way out and every government that came out of the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible blind man.
"It can't last long", said Karel Schwarzenberg, estimating the life of the election season to be two years.
He disagrees, arguing that voters will hardly choose completely differently next time: "I think it will be a bit more balanced decision-making".
At the same time, the TOP 09 chairman does not believe that his party could lose voters in the next election as it did this year (it lost about 300 thousand votes compared to 2010).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it is clear that there will be an early election within two months, it will strengthen Andrei Babis's ANO 2011 movement.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Grandma will lose.
The turbulent situation in the CFSP, where chairman Bohuslav Sobotka declared after a secret meeting in Larnaca that either he or Michal Hašek would remain in the leadership of Social Democracy, Schwarzenberg comments in his own way:
"Democratic Party officials like little boys go to the head of state to allow them to overthrow the party".
"I thought Mr. Hashek was smarter and more intelligent".
"Because I've never seen anything done so stupidly in my life", added the chairman of TOP 09.
And to President Zeman (whom he faced in the presidential race), he said: "The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to take over the party".
The first laws have already been submitted by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you personally?
TOP 09 has formally submitted its first draft laws in the House, including the Farsi Register of Contracts, which was discussed by parliamentary committees before the elections, but fell under the table with the early elections.
The TOP 09 chairman, in an interview with Aktuálně.cz, claims that such speed is given by the fact that "these laws are needed".
At the same time, TOP 09 clearly wants to overtake similar attempts from other parties.
For example, ANO's election leader Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the election campaign of "stealing" the ANO's program by introducing a contract register.
The TOP 09 has now taken the lead - it has simply dusted off a bill that had already been put to second reading.
Firefighters arrive to rescue a lost puppy trapped 50 feet above the ground on a dangerous quarry ledge
Cockspaniel Ruby ran away after a minor car accident.
Three days later, he was spotted trapped in a quarry by a man who was walking his dog.
The firefighters jumped over a rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was rescued by firefighters who came to rescue him after he somehow got himself trapped on a dangerous ledge in a quarry 50 feet above the ground.
A nine-month-old cocker spaniel named Ruby escaped after a minor car accident on Sunday afternoon, surviving on its own for three days until it was released from the quarry on Wednesday.
His owners Scott Alderson (25) and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were at the Flappit quarry in Denholm, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and to thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After he ran away, got into a little accident, they were frantically searching for their lost dog and posting challenges on social media.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a bright-eyed dog-walker spotted Ruby trapped on a spit in a quarry 50 feet above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and headed down to free Ruby, using a pet-carrying bag to pick him up off the cliff.
The technical rescue team's expert commander, Andy Clayton, said the dog was in a dangerous situation.
He was right in the middle of the rock wall, 50 feet from top to bottom.
He didn't move his eyebrow when we rescued him. He was totally frozen.
But he's all right now.
He got cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
It's incredible that anyone saw the dog.
"Ruby had great luck during his escape", said Peter Lau, technical team leader.
There was a possibility that he might be very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a checkup, and other than exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Miss Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "I was scared when I saw the rescue operation.
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was so wonderful to hold him again.
The vet said if he got too exhausted and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
The fire department did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're so grateful to them, they've all been just great.
Mr Alderson of Keighley added: "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there".
The fire department was great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger says that Katy Perry was 18 at the time, and he definitely didn't go.
In an interview for an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock star and he went after her.
And she added, "That was a long time ago, and now he's very nice to me".
In a statement Thursday, Jagger's representative said he categorically denies that Katy Perry ever proposed.
The deputy said, "Maybe he's confused with someone else".
Perry was one of the guest singers who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert string this year.
Her new album, Prism, debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another scary story of independence.
This time, the warning appears that the condition for an independent Scotland's EU membership would be its entry into Schengen.
This gave rise to stories of passport controls in Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
It is true that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but  as might be expected  it did not make headlines.
Nor did anyone mention that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws when it suits them.
Given that Scotland is not now in Schengen, an offer of continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for whatever it really wants from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
The journalistic duck that "independence means passport control" I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet, there is an interesting thought in this bearded tale.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe?
Why trade the London chomout for the Brussels one, especially now?
This is the true story of Europe: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
The so-called Europe Project is officially dead because of the euro crisis.
Across Europe, parties dedicated to resisting the EU or abolishing the euro as a common currency are gaining influence.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party founded this year came out of nowhere and already won almost five million votes in the federal election in September, effectively ousting the Free Democrats (the British equivalent of the Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
At home, there has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, has become the turning point.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with the straitjacket imposed on national economies by sticking to the single currency, have led many to conclude that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments managing high budget deficits  this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a euro system that locks its members in exchange rates favourable to German exporters, and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluing its domestic currency, southern Europe is at a disadvantage compared to Germany in terms of domestic production.
The only way to help is to cut public revenue and expenditure, which Germany is encouraging.
The current budgetary and monetary problems are rooted in the European poor performance.
As a result of the 'green' energy policy promoted by Brussels, the 'code' for supporting French and German companies at the expense of consumers, European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gasoline as it does in the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have seen in Grangemouth.
Even all the wage freezes in the world would not deter the European petrochemical industry from being flooded with cheap shale oil from the US.
The result is a raging revolt, especially in France, once a staunch supporter of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as an instrument to keep Germany in check and allow Paris to be on the same level as Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a proof of political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policies in Europe and left the worn-out French economy to its fate.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right wing, the anti-European National Front, just won a crucial by-election, pushing the ruling Socialists to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote  a timely warning to British Labour that they cannot assume that the split on the right will automatically translate into a positive left.
How is Le Pen handling her newfound popularity among the white working class?
She would like to use the European elections next year to create an anti-European bloc across the European Parliament, acting against the single currency.
If the anti-European parties do well in this election, which is likely, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time in history.
I think that in the near future, the growing anti-European sentiment and the attitude against the single currency will come together and the euro will be destroyed.
The EU will not disappear, but rather transform itself into something more free in the sense of the "Europe of (sovereign) nations" that General de Gaulle favoured.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project and join the United States.
However, Washington's increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be a region of (basically) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes the possibility of telling Berlin and Brussels when to let us go.
I suppose Scotland would do well in a liberalised Europe provided it kept its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should follow the example of Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is  surprisingly  the most successful non-austerity political movement in Europe, winning a large majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition stance to the cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the ensuing coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland were to vote for independence now just to adopt austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Early
Research has shown that African-American and Hispanic women reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching
There's no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are involved.
Experts say that one of the triggers of early puberty may be the obesity epidemic.
The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced in boys.
Former CNN reporter Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be horrified when her daughter starts growing breasts and shameful hair at 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are fairly common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I spent a lot of time reassuring my parents that it's not usually a sign of rapid progress toward full puberty", Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, pubic hair, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
However, in the last 40 years, there has been little change in the age at which menstruation occurs.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years old, compared with 12.75 years in 1970.
"When breasts start to develop, it takes at least two to three years for the first menstrual period to occur", said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem".
The most reliable test of how puberty will progress is time.
It is debated what actually triggers the onset of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spurt before age 8, a girl is considered "premature".
In most cases, the process slows down or stops, which can be closely monitored by the pediatrician.
Rapid growth may be a reason for the endocrinologist to perform tests to rule out serious problems, such as a tumor or cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent the further consequences: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to stunting and curvature in adulthood.
Recommendations for medication and hormone therapy depend on the child's age, developmental rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
There are also psychosocial aspects that are important.
As for the use of drugs, Kaplowitz is cautious, but he recognizes that "suppressing puberty can alleviate the behavioural problems of a girl and her feelings of being different from her peers".
Understandably, there is another big problem: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have their period.
"They're worried she might get pregnant or how she'll handle hygiene", Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock", recalls one woman whose daughter began menstruating at age 10.
Even though there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
But there is no consistent body of evidence yet that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz proposes that the most serious cause is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped lead a study on girls ages 6 to 9 that linked body fat to the timing of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic women tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
There are different explanations.
Globally, early puberty patterns seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys may experience facial hair at an early age and shame, the trend toward full bloom of early puberty is not as pronounced as it is in girls.
Other physicians attending the American Pediatric Association (AAP) conference added to the complexity of the subject.
Acne and baldness are common even in infants and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty", said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for instructions on how to talk to their child.
"It may mean having to talk to the child sooner than you expect", advised Kaplowitz.
If you remain calm, your child will likely respond well.
Girls who are developing early need reassurance that even though it is premature, it is a normal part of life.
Thank you, Convalinks, for the role of hostess.
She got a new job?
Actress Nadya Konvalinkova, 62, appeared in the role of a housekeeper and did very well.
That a popular Czech actress is planning to change careers and start a business in a pub?
Nadya Konvalink showed up at the James Joyce Irish pub and was making beer.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I was right.
My boss even offered to hire me, and I could make a living by spinning beers.
But I refused, I'd rather stay with what I'm doing now, acting", confided Konvalink, who was a guest at the Irish pub's 20th anniversary, with a smile.
"I like Irish beer and I'll have Irish whiskey now and then", the actress revealed.
Nadia's longtime friend and colleague Pavel Nový also showed up.
I'm dead and in this new life I can't drink.
I'm allowed one beer or one drink a day, and I try to stick to that", the actor added.
Aircraft manufacturers are fighting over seat width, big contracts are at stake
A dispute over the width of second-class seats on long-haul flights has erupted among leading aircraft manufacturers, setting off a bitter exchange of views at the Dubai airshow this month.
The dispute concerns the seat width provided for long-haul flights for economy class , which is not exactly the width that airlines would normally prefer, but whose allocation is key to the efficiency claims of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industry standards to offer at least a foot wide seat in economy class, but major U.S. rival Boeing says that's for airlines to decide.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing for the largest version of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way the rear of the aircraft is arranged  especially whether there are 9 or 10 seats next to each other  is the basis of the economic performance claims for the new mini-jumbo aircraft designs.
Boeing says the upgraded 777X will carry 406 people in economy seats over 43 centimeters wide, arranged in 10 rows.
Airbus says that a competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 46 cm wide economy seats arranged in nines.
The giant planes often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in the professional media.
Airbus now appeals directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to dominate with more than 100 orders.
He recently previewed what could be the start of a new advertising war by showing the financiers a picture of three people posted in a restaurant with the caption "Would you like this?"
"Boeing is promoting long-haul flights in seats narrower than those in regional turboprops", said Airbus chief sales officer John Leahy.
As eating habits change, people get bigger, but the seats on planes haven't changed radically.
Since the early 1970's, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul aviation, by the turn of the century, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the weight of the average American aged 40 to 49 had increased by 10 percent.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the average American in the 21st century is 6'5".
Airbus claims that its rival is following the 1950s seat concept, when the average seat width of a newly christened aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims to have conducted research that suggests that a 2.5 cm seat extension improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing rejects Airbus' seat sizes and says that it is not within the competence of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the cabin experience depends on more than just the width of the seat.
"It's really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do the things they believe they need to do to be successful", said cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us dictating what's profitable for them.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, more elbow room is essential, but for suppliers it is a growing problem that can affect revenues.
Behind this dispute is a race to the plane with an estimated trade in the next decade worth at least $700 billion in catalogue prices, enough to weigh the scales of American and European exports.
As Reuters reported in July, the seating arrangement is exactly what's driving the battle between the latest planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim that their latest designs for twin-engine long-haul aircraft are 20% more efficient than the market leader in this segment, the 365 seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's performance requirements depend in part on a comparison of the design of the 777X with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
The unit cost profit is weakened compared to the 10-seat concept.
"The reason Boeing is doing this is to fill more seats and make its aircraft more competitive with our products", said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that the 10-seat cabins in a row for existing 777 models are in line with the fact that many passengers are in favor of a denser layout, which can go hand in hand with lower fees.
"A 45-centimeter-wide seat would be great for the passenger, but the reality is that from Airbus' business point of view, the proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777", said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer airlines a catalogue of suppliers to choose from.
Traveling aircraft dealers even carry a measuring tape with them to check the competitive arrangements.
While boasting of comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-density aircraft for low-cost carriers and regional travellers.
Airbus is offering a 10-seat A350 in a row, but says it hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus had emphasised the need for more cabin modifications by offering wider aisle seats on some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of one more manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industry standards will go unheard, but it may deter a surge in 777X sales.
The number of HIV-infected people in Prague has exceeded 1,000
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected people is increasing every year.
For example, in 2002 50 people were tested for the disease, five years later 121 were tested, and in 2010 180 were tested.
Last year, there were 212 cases, a record number.
"I think there is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year will exceed 200", said Miroslav Hlavatý, an AIDS expert who has been the head of Prague's House of Light for Patients for years.
According to him, 165 new HIV cases were reported in the country between January and September last year, up from 176 during the same period this year.
From the start of the follow-up to the end of September this year, tests confirmed HIV in 1,710 men and 353 women, with the highest number of infections in Prague.
In September, the number reached 1,005.
In the Central Bohemian Region, there were 206 infected people living in the area.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from Moravian-Silesian and 116 from Ustecký.
The least infected came from the Highlands, 19 of them.
A total of 88 percent of the patients were infected during sex.
Fourteen people have been infected by blood transfusions in the past.
However, such a case has not been reported in the Czech Republic since the beginning of the testing, i.e. in more than a quarter of a century.
Six babies were born with HIV, transmitted from their mothers.
The nonsense in the movie Gravity is, but the spectacle is beautiful, experts say
The fantastic film from the universe Gravity sold out in the Czech Republic for some time after its premiere.
In October, it was seen by almost 150,000 viewers and earned over 26 million crowns, according to the Union of Film Distributors.
Most reviews are positive.
Others, however, find some inconsistencies.
The Lidovka.cz server asked astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (director of the Brno Observatory and Planetarium): I like science fiction films, which I consider to be modern, dream fairy tales.
The movie Gravity is no exception, even though it presents itself as a "physical reality" show.
He's not, but that doesn't mean he's bad.
I enjoyed it very much.
You can see, for example, Sandra Bullock's hair, which doesn't float in a weightless state.
Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station travel in very different orbits, so they cannot be seen in one shot.
Some viewers of the film have charged the unrealistic effect and the entire behavior of fire in a weightless state.
They also said that the suits wouldn't hold up against such wounds.
The characters in Gravity often collide with various objects, and the suits will easily hold everything.
Criticism was not spared, nor was the plot.
Such a tragedy on a massive scale in Earth's orbit is unrealistic, some commentators say.
Plus, he wonders why the doctor was sent into space to fix the technology.
People also argue on the forums about "unrealistic" behavior.
They say it looks like it was designed for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (director of the Prague Observatory): I've only seen it on the big screen so far, but I can definitely say that I was fascinated.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, but science fiction.
And in a story like this, the author has the right (almost the obligation) to not follow reality consistently.
"More than the inconsistencies you mentioned, I was moved by the way the space station is shown three times with a degrading level of technology (the last one is Chinese)".
"China will be here by the end of the decade, and it'll probably look better than it does in the movie".
Vladimir Karas (director of the Astronomical Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences): In the computer-generated scenes, the authors try very successfully not to violate the laws of physics, so the naturally oriented viewer will appreciate that the moment of momentum is quite correctly preserved in various cosmic collisions and collisions, in the words of physics, also the view of the Earth from space is very realistic including the thin shell of the atmosphere and the polar glow located on the polar regions.
Inconsistencies will be found upon closer examination.
Additionally, for example, I found in reading the comments that the preferred direction of circulation of various space junk in orbit appears in some scenes to be inverted than it actually should be (west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences): Some things were adapted by the creators to their needs, but I did not notice any fundamental and heaven-calling transgression against logic or natural laws in the film and compared to other films of similar focus, it is seen that the creators paid attention to the credibility of the events depicted.
One of the things that doesn't make sense is that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits in a different inclination than the ISS.
The result is a significantly different speed and therefore the rescue operation could not actually be carried out as depicted in the film.
And then, in the moment of separation between Clooney and Stone, I didn't notice that the ISS was rotating, so there's no clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, forcing both actors to let go when they're no longer moving toward each other.
New nicotine vaccine may take the pleasure out of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take the pleasure out of smoking cigarettes.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mice from nicotine addiction for life.
More tests are needed before human trials, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York says the first signs are good.
"We strongly hope that this type of vaccination strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their addiction to nicotine is so strong that it outpaces all current approaches", said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to create anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then start to produce a steady stream of these antibodies.
The antibodies pursue all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine hit.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice, which were additionally given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
But the unvaccinated mice were calmed down, the researchers said, which is a sign that nicotine had entered their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be given so often to maintain adequate levels of antibodies, they proved expensive and impractical.
The cost of the new vaccine should be much lower, because they're turning liver cells into factories to make antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines are completely safe for humans, they could be given to children before they have the desire to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
However, smokers are much more likely to use it to quit.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not have any pleasure from it because of the nicotine vaccine, and this will help them to get rid of the habit", he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but they cautioned that more research is needed.
Tripodi denies that he was influenced by Obeid.
The former Labor Minister of New South Wales, Australia, will be investigated by the State Board of Corruption Supervision.
Former NSW Minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing the policy on offshore leases at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid lobbied several state ministers to have his lease on Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a cafe, renewed without him having to participate in a tender procedure after it expired in August 2005.
The committee is now investigating the allegation that Mr. Tripodi knew of Mr. Obeid's secret interests in the property, based on evidence presented Thursday by the former deputy chief of staff to Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks that started in 2005, the government pushed for public tenders.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer term terms.
In 2009, the leases for the businesses in Circular Quay, which were earning the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to bid.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister for Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially a supporter of public tenders.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, Mr. Tripodi admitted, was pushing for a shift in government rent policy.
The call logs submitted to ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr Obeid and Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the Port Authority after working under Mr Obeid in the Fisheries Department.
'Was the subject of the discussions during these telephone calls the development of commercial rental policy?' asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy of Mr Tripodi.
"No", said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we talked about, but definitely not this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli military jets have struck a target in Syria, the official in charge said
Israeli warplanes hit targets in the Syrian port of Laziqyah on Thursday night, an official with responsibility for the administration confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not specify what target it was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was a Russian-made SA-125 missile.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel has carried out airstrikes on missile supplies in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
Maybe the commentator Pečinka spoke in a way that was agreeable, while the chairman of the Stech was stirring up discord.
Heytman Chovanec was my suspect as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and he confirmed it.
Chairman Sobotka was always, and is still, a symbol of the misery of the CFSP.
The other gentlemen have shown their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and legible and unusable, Vice President Zaorálek has been hampered by most of the TV interviews.
Based on this, I don't see a better option than for the CSDP to propose as prime minister the vice-president of the Senate, Gajdoshka, the only one who would not have a starting handicap and I think would perform standard.
It's such a good solution, hardly anyone in the board will support it.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what happened and move on without breaking up the party.
Alena Gajdoshková could easily form a minority government with the blessing of President Babis and without the People's Party, but with the People's Party Minister of Health Hovorkou, who is actually a believing Social Democrat.
This minority government would have great stability, because it would enforce the proper referendum law, and that is what President Okamura Dawn has pledged to support.
President Babiš would eventually accept the tax advancement because he's smart and he'll see that it's not possible without it.
The people wouldn't be a problem, because the Speaker is the bearer of the best they have, and they wouldn't be in government otherwise.
The same goes for ANO, there would be a valuable minister here too, but if they are reasonable enough not to enter into risky government participation, but provide support, well done.
Let's give some courage to Alena Gajdoshka!
Foreign workers with visa status may be subject to an eligibility test
As the government plans to expand police intervention, it is considering the "eligibility" test for foreign workers with a 457 visa.
The test, if accepted, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 programme from being used to fill unskilled jobs or as a backdoor for family and friends to move to Australia.
When a government discussion piece was published today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it might offend Australia's neighbours.
"The loud 'foreigners at the end of the line' and 'work first for Australians' statements are a very unpleasant relic of the time when unions demanded a protected labour market", she told the Australian-Indian Institute today.
Historically, this meant protecting white labor, and I wouldn't be surprised if anyone in this region recorded an echo of this historic artifact.
The discussion article discusses 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he's dealing with officials over human trafficking, has implemented five of the recommended changes, and the rest are still to be considered.
If the eligibility criteria are accepted, visa applicants may be examined in detail to see whether the nomination is eligible for situations where the applicant is in a relationship or personal connection with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring enterprise.
Following previous experience with enterprises that intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds, enterprises may also be required to justify the number of 457 visa holders.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on an asylum ship on Christmas Island this week.
The man's frightened nine-year-old son had traveled to Australia with him, and after his father died on Wednesday, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities rushed the man to a hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
The UK Government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
HS2's work indicates that high-speed services for Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as the first phase is launched in 2026.
The Minister of Transport, Baroness Kramer, has told us that the project will "bring the UK together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "enjoyed" to be working with the UK government on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
Once Phase Two is complete, the line will run from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed line between London and the north of England from GBP 32,7 billion to GBP 42,6 billion.
The UK Government, which has been in talks with the national transport authority Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 to explore additional rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for the north of England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of eventual travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: 'Our aim for HS2 is a truly national network that better connects the UK and its cities.'
We've given SH2 a green light because the benefits it brings are enormous.
Without it, we face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it's also about connectivity  across the UK, with HS2 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh will be better connected.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland.
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to unambiguously support Scotland's integration into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: 'The High Speed Line has the potential to bring immense economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds to Scotland's economic weight in the overall case of high speed rail across the UK.'
So we're excited to be working with the UK government to explore the possibilities of bringing high-speed rail to Scotland, to the benefit of all, and to complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish government is planning anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report of this study with the British ministers over the next year and to jointly deciding on the next steps.
Along with Barta, the inspection team arrested an anti-corruption police analyst.
The news of the arrest of Vít Barta began to spread on Thursday evening, when the news was brought by the server Prvnízpravy.cz.
MF DNES soon found out that the case was taken over by the General Inspection of Security Forces (GIBS), whose people were supposed to arrest Bart in the center of Prague.
It happened outside the Four Seasons.
The inspection deals with cases where police officers are among the accused, but its powers also extend to civilians.
According to MF DNES, among the arrested is one of the officers of the anti-corruption police - senior analyst and computer scientist Jan Petržílek.
He used to work for the Secret Intelligence Service.
Anticorruption police spokesman Jaroslav Ibehej, however, declined to comment on the information, saying that the media must turn to GIBS in this matter.
Even her spokeswoman, Radka Sandorová, refused to comment on the case, referring to the Prague City Prosecutor's Office.
"We will not comment on this question in the interest of protecting classified facts", said the spokeswoman of the prosecutor's office, Štěpánka Zenklová.
Again, this non-specific reaction suggests that the event took place, but is in a state of secrecy that prevents speakers from saying anything specific.
The situation is similar for Barth's lawyer, Oldrich Poor.
He told the media that he represents Barta "in this case as well", but since it is classified information, he cannot confirm or deny Barta's arrest.
Some media initially speculated that Bart's arrest might be related to former police chief Peter Lessy.
He was promoted to the post by Bart, along with former VV chairman Radek John, who was head of the Ministry of the Interior.
The dispute that had been sparked between former Prime Minister Petre Nečas and VV had to be resolved by the then President Václav Klaus.
I don't know where this connection came from.
No one contacted me, I wasn't questioned.
"I don't really know anything about things", Lessy told iTONES.cz.
In January 2011, Lessy became the Chief of Police.
Officially, it was put forward by Radek John, the real party leader, but at the time, it was Barta.
Barta now ran for the elections for the Dawn Movement, the parliamentary mandate escaped him only by a narrow margin - by 175 votes.
The leader of the Dawn, Tomio Okamura, has said that he has no idea what this is.
"Vit Barta was one of many candidates from many parties for our candidacy and as I repeatedly said before the election, he was not and is not a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy Tomia Okamura", he distanced himself from Barta Okamura, who before the election said that he gave Barta the space to run for Dawn because it helped him solve the problem of executioners.
Vít Barta was in court in 2012 with his former party colleague Jaroslav Škárka.
Rules on the use of electronic devices on board aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Passengers on Australian airlines will continue to have to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite changes in the US to ease regulations on these devices.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given American airlines room to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight, as long as the devices remain in flight mode.
Passengers can already do this for most of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot access their electronic books during take-off and landing.
The Australian carriers are investigating this decision, which requires a lot of work from the US carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they have no plans to change their practices anytime soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said that it had examined this notification but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight are still in place in Australia.
CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic equipment on board aircraft, he said.
This issue is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, which has already spoken to CASA about the expansion of its wi-fi in-flight entertainment system, was in favour of the change but announced that it would submit to the regulatory authority's decision.
"We would welcome CASA to conduct an analysis of the permits to use electronic devices because we really think that now that we have [wireless in-flight entertainment], it would improve the customer experience", the spokesman said.
Qantas has announced that it will comply with the current regulations for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no intention of changing that anytime soon", he said.
The FAA regulations apply to American airlines.
But we're constantly interested in regulatory developments that could be useful to our passengers, and we're certainly looking closely at the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
In the case of US air carriers, the impact of the regulations will vary from one company to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile phones, and also revise manuals, training materials, hand baggage programmes and passenger information.
"Once an airline confirms its fleet's tolerance, it can allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at any altitude", the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will order passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
The Group also recommended that heavy equipment be safely stored under seats or in storage space above the head during take-off and landing.
With the growing poverty of the middle class, the pawn shops of Singapore are booming
At a pawn shop in Singapore's Bendemeer mall, Janani Amirthalinga stocks a gold bracelet, ring and earring to pay her daughter's school fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house and I put all my money into it", says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she receives $2,400 a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is not enough, she says.
The demand across Southeast Asia, where household debt is rising, is indeed such that ValueMax, where a woman makes her transaction, has become the third-highest-ranked company on the Singapore Exchange this week.
Stopping jewellery is not only a quick way to borrow cash  1300 SGD in the case of Ms Amirthalinga , but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
The rate of interest charged by the Singapore branch is 17%, just above the rate of 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, the advantages of the landlords are that they do not require identification (payment history) or proof of income and can grant loans faster than banks.
And so, with families feeling the pressure of rising living costs and growing household and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to mortgage companies.
After five years of tremendous growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit, supported by loose monetary policies in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to mortgages to cope with their worsening financial situation.
This week, Standard & Poor's ratings agency cited the increasing use of credit by households, primarily due to rising rents, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt per GDP in Asia.
Malaysia tops the list with a share of 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists also feared the high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely recovered from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and weaker consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with rising costs, people from the middle to the low [income] will try to supplement their income wherever they can", said Song Seng Wun, an economist at Malaysia's CIMB Bank.
The historically high gold prices of the past two years have contributed to people temporarily stopping their personal assets and taking the opportunity to exchange their family jewelry for cash.
About 70 percent of the items held in 200 city pawnshops are gold.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, we'll stop Grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month".
The largest pawnshop operator in Thailand, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its pawnshop in recent months.
Growth in the mortgage industry is so great that ValueMax, which operates a branch in the center of Bendemeer and 15 similar ones in Singapore, plans to expand not only into neighbouring Malaysia, where it has four branches, but also outside Asia, says ValueMax CEO Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will finance it using 60 percent of the SGD 66 million it raised this week on the Singapore Exchange.
While some discount lenders have come under fire for their high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says that the mortgage not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
"Customers are stopping items they already own, and monetizing personal assets does not increase household debt", he says.
In society, asset pledges are increasingly accepted as a means of securing short-term, secure financing.
Moreover, those who use pawnshops are not the only ones in financial distress.
Rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax branches when they stop gold bars or Rolex watches, and they can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our clients come from all walks of life.
"These include wealthy individuals who need short-term loans for their bold business or investment, or small businesses who need help solving their cash flow problems", says Ms Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money as soon as possible.
A $325 million bailout package for Tasmanian health care
The federal government insists that the $325 million bailout package for Tasmania's dying healthcare system include tough conditions to ensure the state government does not waste funds.
The Federal Minister for Health, Tanya Plibersek, announced that the Australian Federation is taking "accelerated action" to avert the crisis caused by the island's ageing population, higher rates of chronic diseases and systemic disruption.
The four-year funding was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilke.
"The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the country", Ms Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for surgeries at the patient's request.
An additional 2,600 operations, including orthopedic and cataract surgery, will help to eliminate the debt.
The money is also being spent on free clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved post-operative care, training for health professionals, mental health services and introducing personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
"These investments are in response to ideas that leading clinicians have told me will best help Tasmania's healthcare system", said Ms Plibersek.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian Government must require a strict reporting and recordkeeping regime.
The State will have to maintain the current level of funding to receive the money from the Australian Union and report monthly on where the additional funds have been spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the State delivers services as efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million will be of no use until genuine reform is implemented to lay a more sustainable foundation for Tasmania's public health system.
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for emergency aid, which he first raised during a meeting with the Prime Minister in early May.
"I believe the federal relief package can lift the state's public health system out of its critical state", said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the State Government, these additional selected procedures will significantly reverse the recent cuts.
Federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's statement is nothing more than a "plasty".
"The reason I'm here is the Labour government has cut $430 million from our health care system", he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state government taking almost half a billion dollars, and the Australian Federation donating 300 million dollars, and pretend that's good news.
Mr. Dutton has challenged Mrs. Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout will be spent on higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux adapted a novel by Denise Diderote, which offers an exceptional cinematic adventure and depiction of time, but is also more boring than it should be.
Set in the 1860s in France, it tells the bleak story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman who is sent by her family to a convent.
When she rebels, she experiences extreme cruelty from a reprehensible mother superior, and becomes an object of sexual passion for another.
A film never gets to the point of being flashy or sensational, and that's the problem.
The ceremonial nature of the story means that the viewers will also experience the torment of wearing a ragged shirt.
Ski areas want to give a discount to families with children
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production facilities, says watchdog
Syria has destroyed critical equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Committee said on Thursday, as fierce clashes erupted in the north of the country near one of the suspected sites of the poison.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group said that since the start of the civil war nearly three years ago, more than 120,000 civilians have been killed.
The announcement from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before November 1st,
the deadline set by the Hague-based organisation for Damascus to destroy or disable all chemical weapons production facilities and chemical mixing machinery for the purpose of producing toxic gas and loading munitions.
The completion of this essentially initial phase of destruction is a significant milestone in the ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
Destruction of equipment means Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
It is estimated that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including yperite and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came as fighting raged in the town of Safira, which experts refer to as the site of a chemical weapons factory and warehouse, on Thursday, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
An activist group that tracks the total death toll through a network of activists in Syria reported on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 members of the armed forces of Bashar al-Assad, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 armed men from the Lebanese Hezbollah.
The death toll is also reported to include 2,202 government defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since.
The conflict has forced some 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's forces have been fighting in Safir against insurgents, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda, for weeks.
The Observatory said Thursday that losses were on both sides, but it didn't have specific numbers.
The fighting highlighted the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who must cope with tight deadlines in their mission to dispose of Syria's chemical arsenal amid the ongoing civil war.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, said its team is now "satisfied" to have verified and monitored the destruction of "Syrian declared critical manufacturing and blending/filling equipment".
He added that 'no further control activities are currently planned'.
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were unable to visit two sites because of safety concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that these two sites were "abandoned" by Syria and that ... the items of the chemical weapons program that they contained had been moved to two other declared sites that were inspected.
It was not immediately clear whether the Sapphire facility was one of the places that the OPCW inspectors were not allowed to visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan to completely destroy its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I salute the courage and bravery you have shown in carrying out this most challenging mission this organization has ever had", said Director of Observers Ahmet Uzumcu in a commentary published by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, it is pitted against each other in a civil war, mainly Sunni Muslim rebels and the Assad government with its security forces, which are full of members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
As for further developments, the head of the Observatory, Ramí Abdul Rahman, said that on Wednesday, there was a massive explosion inside an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Laziqiya.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over the verdict against the perpetrator of the Bali bombing
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the verdict against the last of the perpetrators who were brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be executed.
Patek, who spent nearly a decade on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for assembling the explosive device used in the bombing.
He could be paroled in 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder in the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of several other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution was seeking life in prison, although it could have insisted that the man nicknamed "Demolition Man" be given the death penalty because of his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of explosives.
This decision has brought back painful memories for June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in a devastating attack by Patek and other instigators nearly a decade ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek should be sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the others' footsteps.
Mrs. Corteen told the AAP, "He should be put on death row".
Every day I have to live with the fact that I won't see any more of my grandchildren and my daughters.
Sari Club was razed to the ground when a powerful bomb placed in an outdoor van was detonated shortly after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar where, just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber had detonated a bag filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while being kept alive, he died three times to doctors.
Mr. Hughes said that Pateka should meet the same fate as the three other members of the Jamaat-e-Islamiya terrorist cell responsible for the massacre of Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like nobody else.
Keeping him alive... no reason to keep him alive, there just isn't.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and injuring hundreds isn't much.
Patek was on trial as the last of the Bali bombers.
He evaded capture for nearly a decade, but was finally caught in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where less than four months later, U.S. forces killed former Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to reestablish ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
"He did not surrender voluntarily", said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he has no remorse for the pain he has caused others.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year, and include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"We're going to see a lot of tears this year", said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek can still appeal the verdict.
FAA: Air travellers can now use technology on planes (but not call from their mobile phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices  from gate to gate  in addition to making calls from their mobile phones  to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music under the eagerly awaited new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect changes to happen immediately.
How quickly the change will be implemented will vary by airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to demonstrate to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals and the equipment storage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted plans are Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the status of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly", the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the aircraft are closed.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches a height of two miles and the captain gives the go-ahead.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the aircraft is descending to land and not turn them on until the aircraft is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines with properly protected aircraft against electronic interference can allow their passengers to use their equipment during takeoff, landing and takeoff, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that have been adapted to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the change.
"Once the new rules are safely implemented and we work closely with transport companies on this, it will be a success", Glading said in a statement.
We're tired of looking like the Watchers, to be honest.
However, surfing the Internet, sending e-mails and text messages, or downloading data will continue to be prohibited below 3 kilometers above sea level, the agency said.
Passengers will be advised to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to air-flight mode.
So still no Words with Friends, the online scrabble game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he was, as is well known, thrown off an American Airlines plane for refusing to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will have to continue to be stored out of fear that they might hurt someone if they were to fly over the cabin.
Mobile phone calls will remain prohibited on board.
The rules for using cell phones are not set by the FAA, but by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said that cell phones continue to be considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but we also know from the FCC data that in the air they can cause interference with broadcast towers", Rosenker said.
A sector advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate the problem last month suggested the government allow wider use of electronic devices.
The FAA has been under pressure in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, argue that there is no legitimate security reason for the ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of such devices is pervasive.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the obligation to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to disruption of navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began carrying FM radios, a technical achievement of the day.
The new airlines are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed, and approved by the FAA, to be resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi in high altitude travel for several years.
Plans modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt to the increased use of electronic devices under the new rules, Huert said.
Modern electronic devices generally emit much less radio intensity than did previous generations of devices.
For example, electronic readers only give a minimal transmission when the page is turned.
But the transmission is stronger when the devices are downloading or sending data.
Among those pushing for easing restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company's representatives loaded a commercial aircraft with their Kindle e-readers and conducted a test flight, but no problems were encountered.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passenger Association said he believes the disruption from these facilities is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members stated that there are only fragmentary reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause disruption to aircraft systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off equipment during flight according to instruments in low visibility.
The tourism industry group welcomed these changes and considered that this was a sensible course of action for the traveling public, which makes extensive use of the technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that a pleasant travel experience is not at odds with safety", said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was airlifted from a drilling rig in the North Sea and released back into the wild
The bird was brought ashore after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One of the youngsters was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after being treated by the Scottish company SPCA at a rescue centre until he recovered.
Operations Centre Colin Seddon said: "This stork was probably migrating from northern Europe when it was caught in a strong wind over the North Sea".
Apparently, he's run out of energy and has taken refuge on the oil rig.
Mr. Seddon added: "He was unable to take off again, so we were contacted with a request for assistance".
By the time the stork was released, he was in good shape and healthy.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a promise to bring businesses together and define what changes in the EU relationship UK entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see.
To do this, we have conducted the largest and most comprehensive survey of leading UK business people asking their views on the UK, trade and the EU.
YouGov interviewed 1 000 business leaders representing UK businesses of all sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We found that the vast majority of companies are now trying to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing, while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see the government prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming Europe's mysterious institutions.
When asked for their views on specific policy areas  from monopoly regulation to product law , most businessmen expressed the view that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and businessmen said that the costs of Brussels regulations now outweighed the benefits of being part of the European trade area.
And finally, our survey of business leaders revealed the most eloquent insight, and that is that a clear majority wants Britain to seek a change in the treaty and relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings, which have been shared by businesses of different sizes and major business groups, show that the business sector is pushing for 'meaningful change' that will bring the impact back to the UK.
There is a lot at stake  a change in the treaty and a better deal for Britain could mean a gain of up to 16% in the referendum on remaining in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this poll shows that British business supports his plan to revise the terms of UK membership of the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to represent a significant shift away from the current balance of power back towards the UK.
A better deal for Britain is possible and increasingly necessary as the euro area embarks on the road to closer economic and fiscal union.
Jobs and growth in the UK must be a priority, and as our survey results show, this means a refocus on trade for business and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach in Brussels.
John Kerry admits spying has gone too far!
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in spying, US Secretary of State John Kerry admitted during a video conference between Washington and London, according to AFP.
But the minister said the intelligence gathering was used to deter terrorist attacks.
The "first confession from Washington", according to AFP, came amid fierce controversy on both sides of the Atlantic over the scandalous revelations of mass surveillance by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which has also targeted US allies.
"In some cases, I admit, as did President Obama, some of these actions have gone too far, and we assure you that this will not happen in the future", Kerry said.
But he was mostly defending his practice.
He said that information gathering is essential to fight terrorism and prevent attacks such as the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States, the Madrid attacks of March 2004 and the London attacks of July 2005.
"We prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being killed because we were able to be informed of the plans in time", Kerry stressed.
However, he reiterated that the information gathering "went in some cases disproportionately far".
The US intelligence scandal, which allegedly monitored hundreds of millions of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turns out that Americans have been monitoring the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders were not shy about their outrage, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would prevent or significantly limit surveillance.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says the pipeline in Bulgaria is ushering in a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, the head of Gazprom said.
"Today we are witnessing a milestone: the start of construction on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe", Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement.
This project is a key element of energy security for the whole European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to the routes of Russian exports through Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russia's gas to Europe, adds to the risks of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says that a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "eliminated forever".
Once the entire project is operational in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says construction is scheduled to begin in other countries later this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
The decisive battle is ahead.
The Lebanese Hezbollah has deployed 15,000 fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle for the mountainous region of Kalamun.
According to the increasingly accurate reports, Israel destroyed missiles targeting Hezbollah in two airstrikes on Wednesday in western Syria.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria with the army there.
Its agenda is also to fight Israel, which is not involved in the Syrian conflict, but has made it clear that it will prevent the transfer of arms to Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Reports of Israeli airstrikes on Wednesday on weapons depots in western Syria are only getting more precise.
Israel has not commented on the attack, but American sources have confirmed it.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, missiles fired from the Mediterranean Sea have hit the Syrian missile base Snúbar Jabla south of Latakia.
Al-Arabiya news station says two warehouses were hit, where the missiles were being prepared to be shipped to Lebanon.
According to her sources, they were Russian-made SA-8 missiles.
Israel declined to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Yishai said Syria was continuously trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian Air Force was training members of Hezbollah's armed wing to handle missiles.
The SA-8s are obsolete missiles that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They're mounted on a moving chassis.
Although they are rather primitive, their mobility and small size make them easy to hide.
They're equipped with radar, but it shuts down after a missile fires, making it difficult to locate them.
Latakia is located in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling Alawites.
It's a heavily guarded area, and Hezbollah has been involved in fighting in western Syria in the past.
He claims to be helping protect the Syrian Shiite community, which includes the Alawites.
Now, it is said that 15,000 of his warriors are ready to help the army recapture Kalamun.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also reinforcing its forces there.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and the third-largest city in the country, Homs.
The battle is reportedly in retaliation for the recent opposition attack on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite Brigade of Abu Fadl Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army recapture the town of Qusayr on the Lebanese border this year.
Many of the rebels from Kusair have gone to Kalamun.
Until recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
Corruption, overspending on government contracts, tax increases, and, last but not least, government scandals were cited as reasons.
The results of the elections show that the majority of citizens were happy with this situation.
That they didn't really mind and with the state of affairs that was here, they were actually happy.
Otherwise I can't explain why 3 413 497 voters did not come to the polls, 596 357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters voted ODS total 4 394 028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.16% of all eligible voters.
Which is over half the vote.
If I add 1 016 829 voters to the above parties, then the old order (because all the parties involved in the "robbery" and indebtedness of this state), then this state was actually approved by 64,23% of the legitimate voters.
In fact, a majority of voters have indicated that they are not punishing the guilty for stealing and over-indebting this country.
Or do you think the members of the CPSU who participated in this will push for appropriate legislation?
Is there any help for us?

The Royal Commission has learned that prior to the charges against Jonathan Lord, two employees of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) were charged with
The Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse has learned that before charges were brought against Caringbah child educator Jonathan Lord in 2011, two employees of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of child sexual abuse.
But it was reported to the committee that in its opening statement to the committee, the association stated that it had never handled a case of child sexual abuse within its organization.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case where one of the YMCA's employees was charged with child pornography offenses, and another where the Caringbah gymnasium vicar of the YMCA was convicted in 1991 of sexually molesting children in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, the commission counsel, that he knew about the first case, but not the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA's opening statement was inaccurate in stating that external audits were carried out at the YMCA, which had recognised the organisation as a leading advocate for children's rights.
The evidence presented by the committee indicates that the YMCA was alerted to the fact that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in the audit of the Ministry of Education and Society from August this year.
Mr. Hare, who started with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that the leadership from him down failed to take Mr. Lord on without making sure that the staff were aware of the obligation to report child safety violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexually assaulting 12 boys during his two years with the YMCA.
He was jailed for a minimum of six years.
Mr. Hare, however, denied the claim that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting Mr. Lord's child safety violations.
Staff members have provided evidence of witnessing such violations, including Lord being alone with the children, privately babysitting them, having them sit on his lap, telling them he loved them, and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's employee and requested child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, the head of child services at the Caringbah YMCA, who was Lord's employee, was "very intimidating and often difficult to talk to".
The CEO said he would not accept evidence from staff that they felt uncomfortable if they should contact their superiors and report their actions.
Instead, he said their friendship with the Lord had clouded their judgment, and so they didn't report the problem.
Mr Hare said he had told the board of the New South Wales YMCA that the lesson for the organisation from the Jonathan Lord case was that staff had not reported, and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to have staff sign non-disclosure agreements shortly after the allegations emerged was made by the YMCA's General Manager of Children's Services, Liam Whitley.
He said the goal was to avoid tampering with evidence, but it was "overly zealous" and poorly executed.
Child sexual abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission that the YMCA in New South Wales was not a safe organisation for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said that there were serious problems in recruitment, screening, employment, training and management of personnel.
The hearing was adjourned to December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return to the post of Prime Minister, but he admitted that a return is unlikely.
In an interview at night on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic politics.
Since June 2007, when he stepped down after 10 years in the leadership position, Mr Blair has mostly avoided discussions of British politics, and has limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as an envoy for the BSE Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, his answer was quoted in the Evening Standard of London as follows: "Yes, of course, but it's unlikely that will happen, so... "
As the crowds of show jumping experts gathered in Cardiff to compete for the Horse of the Year award, it was clear that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he is not yet in school and only took his first steps a few months ago, this little boy and his pet, the Shetland pony Toffee, have smoothly swept three rounds to finally win the grand prize, leaving behind 30 dragging adult competitors.
The inseparable pair - with the same height - were praised for their looks, behaviour and style at the annual competition run by the Sunnybank equestrian centre in the village of Rudry near Cardiff.
He stood up to the gentlemen and ladies in fancy hats, tucked his baret into a cheerful corner and let his two-year-old Toffee stroll around the circuit.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural ability to control horses that far surpassed his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for insight and personality.
Fenton got Toffee for his third birthday in March, and he's been training with this Shetland pony every day since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee work together great".
They didn't have much hope, but they left with a golden cup and flowers.
It was only the second time he'd competed with Toffee, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone thought he was phenomenal, and complete strangers wanted to take pictures with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says: "There was an exciting atmosphere, and everyone cheered and applauded".
He ran across the sand along the length of the arena and, although he seemed so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals, loves horses, tractors and farming, and he's got two chickens.
Considering how he started, he'll be back at the Horse of the Year competition soon and I'm sure he'll do well.
A spokesman for the annual showdown said: "The Fentons are only three, but they already know how to handle a pony".
They make a great team.
The judges picked Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and the way they performed on the competition circuit.
They always watch how good the teamwork is between the pony and the person who drives it, and Fenton and Toffee were the best on the oval.
I'm sure Fenton's cute outfit helped him, really fit in with him.
Too curious newspapers to be investigated
Chinese newspapers that have made a front page request for the release of a reporter accused of defamation will be thoroughly investigated, the press administrator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express has issued a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to make up stories about a company partially owned by the state.
The manager said the New Express is now doing a "full correction".
The order for the correction came from the State Administration of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong Province.
The provisional investigation showed that from September 2012 to August 2013, the New Express newspaper of the Yangcheng Evening News group published several false reports about the company Zoomlion.
"The editorial staff of the New Express was disorganized", the editor said in a statement.
He said he had to decide to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of revoking his journalism license.
He also ordered the Yangcheng Evening News Group to carry out a complete overhaul of the New Express and recommended that they investigate the relevant persons responsible for the New Express and immediately change the management of the New Express.
Mr. Chen wrote a few articles for New Express about financial irregularities at a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper published two petitions on the front page for his release, claiming that it was behind his journalistic work.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and admitted to publishing false stories for a bribe.
"In this case, I have caused harm to Zoomlion and also to the entire media industry and its ability to gain the trust of the public", he told state-run CCTV news station.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realize I did wrong.
After Mr. Chen's apology, the New Express published a front-page apology in which he stated that he had failed to carry out adequate scrutiny of his messages.
Recently, several highly-tracked suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still being forced on a regular basis, despite a change in the law this year that prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
A drug-smuggling tunnel was found between the U.S. and Mexico with its own railroad .
They've managed to discover one of the most ingenious drug-smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico, complete with its own lighting, ventilation, and electric railroad.
U.S. authorities described the tunnel, measuring about one by one meter, as one of the most ingenious secret passageways they had ever discovered.
The tunnel, which runs the length of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
This area is full of undefined warehouses where trucks can easily be hidden before they are loaded with drugs.
Authorities say the tunnel was sealed off before drugs could be smuggled through.
Along with the tunnel's discovery, authorities also seized, according to court records, eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine.
Three men, who authorities say were working as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute.
If convicted, he faces a sentence of 10 years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers are infiltrating the city's extensive drainage systems.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after a marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which poses a problem for drug cartels in getting their product to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, authorities found a corridor some 2,000 feet [600 m] long, equipped with rails that led from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economics and the Center are the link between management.
They'll offer a joint ad, for example.
The new integrated newsroom of Economia in Prague Karlín.
Economia has taken the next step in transforming Centrum Holding into its media house.
From Friday, Economy and Centre have a joint top management.
"The unification of the organisational structure and the personnel union is essential for the integration of both publishers into a common media house", comments the Vice-Chairman of the Board of Economy and Managing Director Kamil Čermák.
Mr Czermak, who will head the single management, will be joined by CEO of Centrum Holdings Andreas Demuth.
The new joint director of the store was appointed Pavel Vopařil, who is also subordinated to the advertising director of both companies, Zuzana Tylčerová.
The new head of IT is Stepan Burda.
The joint editorial director is Vladimir Piskáček, whose team also includes the director for transformation Jakub Unger.
The newly created position of marketing director was given to Adele Pitts.
The separate corporate communications department is now headed by Vera Lhotská.
The joint financial director is Karel Žalud, the human resources management for both publishing houses is headed by Petra Slabá.
"The new organisational structure will, among other things, allow us to enter the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better link the content creation of all titles issued and, last but not least, to further significantly streamline the company's commercial management", added Čermák.
Economia, owned by financier Zdeněk Bakala, signed a deal to buy Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April.
The Centrum Holdings portfolio consists of the servers Aktuálně.cz, Žena.cz, web portals, a large e-mail database under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and the SMB agency Najisto, as well as a portfolio of almost two dozen other smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of Hospodářské noviny, the news server IHNED.cz, the weekly Respekt and Ekonom and a number of print and internet B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, it has been the most successful in selling digital versions of its major titles.
In June this year, the publishing house moved into newly built modern premises in Prague's Karlín.
CME is targeting the TV business.
They're releasing almost a quarter of the people.
CME Media Group is going to lay off.
He wants to lose 1,000 people by the end of the year.
He's going to cut all the side activities and focus on his main business, broadcasting.
The group, which owns TV Nova in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of around 4 500 people.
Almost a quarter of the people will lose their jobs.
The media group operates television stations in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CET 21 is a member of CME, which holds the broadcasting licences for Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and the Czech version of the music channel MTV.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs around 650 people, and what this will mean for the country's TV Nova flagship, is not yet clear.
"It's premature and we really can't comment", said Novy's communications director Josef Koukolíček.
According to MF DNES, the Czech Republic will certainly face significant redundancies, but by far the greatest impact will be on the staffing situation of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both the new Nova bosses Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who took over from long-time CEO Adrian Sarbu, spoke to analysts during a conference call on Wednesday about their intention to restrict all activities not directly related to the television business.
It is therefore likely that they will significantly reduce, in particular, the costs of producing their own programmes, filming and producing.
The cooling tower burned down at the Czech Republic's industrial complex in Prague last night.
A large-capacity storage tank burned in the industrial complex of ČKD in Prague, according to the firefighters, probably a cooling tower.
"Firefighters were already going to the fire on Thursday before 11 pm, this morning they were still putting out the fire", said Pavlína Adamcová, a spokeswoman for the Prague fire brigade.
The amount of pollutants in the ambient air has not exceeded the permitted limits as measured.
The extent of the damage and the cause of the fire are unknown.
About five dozen firefighters gradually arrived at the Kolben Street campus.
"It's a fire in a large-capacity storage tank, probably a cooling tower", said Adamc.
"There is no functioning hydrant network in the area, so we are extinguishing with the help of the pipes from the tankers", she added.
According to the tn.cz server, the fire was complicated by a malfunctioning network of hydrants, so the firefighters had to transport water from elsewhere.
The fire chief has declared a second-level fire alarm.
There are four stages, and in the most serious cases, a fourth is called.
Chemists were also sent to the scene to check the level of hazardous substances that could be released into the air during a fire.
"But they did not detect any airborne pollutants that exceeded hygienic standards", said a fire department spokesman.
British police have delivered an extradition notice to Assange
British police today handed over extradition notices to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he sought asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had delivered an extradition notice to the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to report to the police station and that if he did not, he could face arrest.
Assange exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court this month overturned his appeal against extradition, and he faces extradition to Sweden on sex crimes charges.
Fearing Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he sought refuge on June 19 at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum in the South American country.
Scotland Yard has delivered an extradition notice to the 40-year-old man, asking him to appear at the police station on the day and time set for him, a spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate the terms of his bail.
The embassy declined to comment on the delivery of the extradition notice.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he may face charges of espionage because he published 250,000 US diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
Driver fined £1,000 for driving 200mph with a hot drink between his legs
The motorist was fined £1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was seen driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a cup of liquor between his thighs.
At the Colchester Police Court, Howie pleaded guilty to the charge of reckless driving and driving without due care and attention.
He was awarded seven points, resulting in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay costs of £90 and a surcharge of £100 for the defendant.
The London bubble is bursting as a result of the tax on foreign property ownership
The Treasury has pre-established the tax on financial asset income, but is awaiting the final decision of Mr Osborne, who introduced in the 2012 budget a 7% transfer fee for buildings over £2 million and annual fees for buyers who own property within the company, not as individuals.
The transfer fee revenue in the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea housing fund, which reached £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: 'Given the increase in real estate transfers for high value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high value property is undertaxed regardless of the effect of the outdated head tax system.'
He added that 'this move may have caused some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy or sell properties in London'.
The top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price in the wealthy belt stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, saw a record 11.8% increase last year.
Prices in central London continued to show steady year-on-year growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by the booming 'domestic market', where, according to Savills' survey, the South West, North (7.4%) and East (6.5%) were experiencing increases.
Scientists shed more light on how tail movements are linked to a dog's mood
Previous research has shown that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs wag their tails mostly to the left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences in tail movements.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said: "It is well known that the left and right sides of the brain have different responses to stimuli that trigger positive or negative emotions".
We've been trying to observe the same thing in other species.
He added that, as in humans, the right hemisphere of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
In an effort to learn more about how dogs react to the disproportionate wagging of other dogs' tails, researchers monitored animals watching movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't take long to figure out why their tail sometimes goes one way and sometimes the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed the dogs the dog movies either in a natural version or in silhouette form to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we were also able to adjust the tail movement to show it more to the right or left".
When the animals saw the otherwise inconspicuous dog wagging its tail to the right (from the dog's tail-wiggling view), they remained completely calm.
But when she noticed the tail turning mostly to the left (again from the dog's point of view, which was tail-twisting), their heart rate increased, and the animals seemed uncertain.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs would consciously communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned by experience what movements they must and must not pay attention to.
He said, "If you meet dogs several times and their tail movements in one direction are repeatedly associated with more friendly behavior and their tail movements to the right produce less friendly behavior, you will react based on that experience".
Researchers say the findings may help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers better understand the emotions of their pets.
Dog behaviorist John Bradshaw, a professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study to examine whether the left and right sides are important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they see an aggressive dog, and to the right when they see a cheerful dog.
And in another paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "Dogs were more likely to recognize a robot dog when it was wagging its tail to the left than to the right, when it was more likely to become uncertain".
The difference, he says, is that in these different studies of animals in movies or dog robots, they didn't interpret themselves as dogs.
He explained that it could help study how dogs react to real dogs.
"Although there is strong evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes in many different mammals, many details still need to be clarified", he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won't take long to understand why their tail sometimes goes one way and sometimes the other.
The Arctic Monkeys have moved their Glasgow concert because of Alex Turner's illness.
The Arctic Monkeys have postponed a Glasgow concert after the lead singer was diagnosed with an aneurysm.
The Sheffield band was scheduled to perform at the Hydro City Complex on Friday.
But lead singer Alex Turner's illness forced her to postpone the performance.
The group's announcement came after it was similarly forced to postpone Thursday's performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to postpone today's performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham and based on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys have also postponed their performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday 1 November".
"Alexi Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and unfortunately will not be able to perform".
The performance will take place at the LG Arena in Birmingham on 20 November and at the Hydro complex in Glasgow on 21 November.

Pope Francis names the first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced Thursday that Pope Francis will name new cardinals for the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22.
Cardinals are the highest ranking clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope and are the ones who elect the pope, so Francis will establish his first group of men who will eventually help select his successors.
Now there are 201 cardinals.
However, once a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope  the group is thus reduced to 120 cardinal electors.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting of the current cardinals, known as the consistory, would be held before the solemn promotion of the new cardinals.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world", Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinals voting is likely to fall by February.
He said that the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as he needs to get the votes back to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
Next year's consistory will be significant because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a certain orientation towards Europe, Europe and Italy in particular.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance", he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of cardinals since Francis created the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, who he has tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope made all the decisions for himself.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him", Valero said.
He said it was "quite possible" that these cardinals would be consulted by the pope.
But we haven't been in this situation before. It's a complete novelty.
Valero said that traditionally the popes have promoted bishops from large places to the position of cardinals, but Francis is "full of surprises" so we don't know who he's naming.
GM is recalling some new light trucks in the U.S. for seat-back repairs.
According to a Friday announcement from the U.S. Motor Vehicle Safety Administration, General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light trucks to fix a manual-flap issue.
The front-seat folding mechanism may be defective on some of these vehicles.
As a result, seat backs are not in compliance with federal automotive safety standards for head restraints.
A notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website says that "if a vehicle is hit from behind, the headrest may not protect the occupant properly, which increases the risk of an accident".
The recalled models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
GM launched the delivery in June, and for the leading American automaker, it is the most important vehicle launch since its restructuring after its bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owner of the van of the malfunction in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the owner notification due to 16 days of government shutdowns that weakened growth in car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra, which were redesigned for 2014 models, rose to about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverados and 16,503 Sierras from its deliveries.
The New York Stock Exchange was up 1.4 percent Friday afternoon at $37.47.
The desperate cry of Obama's voters
I voted for Obama twice. I shared the hope for change.
He says Obama's sincere efforts have crushed the Republican Party's obstructionism.
Obstruction policies can't excuse the misery of Obamacare websites or drone attacks.
Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
I thought this book would encourage me during the bleak days of my second year at medical school and renew a glimmer of hope in me.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patient evaluations and go to bed at night, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches took your breath away.
The election ended in a landslide, and the news on television made us think about the historical value of this moment.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents hid the newspapers they had found.
A young team of visionaries headed for the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
When he took office in 2008, Obama had 82 percent support.
And here I close the book.
Moving into the present is a rough awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It's hard to remember these optimistic days, they seem like distant memories, sad memories of wasted opportunities.
In the years since I cast my first ballot, there's been a real change.
It was definitely not what I imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and diverse accomplishments from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq to the end of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy after the killing of Osama bin Laden.
And I believe that party obstruction has reversed so many efforts to move our nation forward, including immigration reform, public choice health care, and the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.
But after many situations where I've defended the Obama administration to colleagues and friends, I've reached an absolute limit in terms of the explanations they can provide.
I felt in a place of political hopelessness.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the approval of wiretapping of foreign leaders or drone strikes that kill innocent children overseas.
They can't explain the NSA's collection of data on the private lives of Americans, or the fact that it prosecutes those who expose government misconduct.
He cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen, without due process or for restricting public contributions and spending during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are the most aggressive since the Nixon administration.
And most recently, they can't even excuse the inability to create a simple website more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was signed.
I don't know if I expected that.
I should have known at 18 that government power could be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it.
The elected office obviously has no predictable course and our public conversations will be shaped by the opposition political party and random events like the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I have given above seem to be largely the result of the administration's own decision.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unedited alternative, and it seemed that he could not consolidate his policies or position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, freed from the pressures of the next election, would fulfill the hopes we once heard.
Yet returning to 2008  with Obama's support dropping below 45% this week  through this book is getting harder.
It makes me remember all the promises that were broken.
I read a chapter in a book this week about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
At an extra meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back on track and stay true to his mission.
"I want our magic back", he said.
We must not forget who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are those of Nathaniel Morris alone.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest over the parental leave program.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest over the parental leave program because his daughters could get pregnant and profit from it.
A mining tycoon who is in the middle of a $6 million tax-incrimination lawsuit made this claim in an attempt to dispel the issue of conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which will play a crucial role in deciding whether to levy taxes on coal and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could be in conflict of interest, and added that the Abbott daughters were in a position to benefit personally from the policy.
"He got into a big conflict of interest with regard to paid parental leave because if any of his daughters got pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether she got parental leave", Mr Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission, after the vote count, officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the contest for the Fairfax district of the Sunshine Coast Region by a margin of 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer has called for a review of the election results to expedite the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the polls close?
"We must have a better system", he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, type the details into your computer, vote instantly, and get the results at 7:30 p.m.?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
Is it that you can just fiddle with the results if you don't like them?
In this day and age, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission has been studying the possibilities of electronic voting and recently issued a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his political agenda extended to the Sunshine Coast airport and that he would take his new job 'very seriously'.
Public office is a public service.
"We are not seeking any reward other than that we can serve society at this critical time", he said.
Are you washing your hands?
Scientists have found that washing your hands can change your mood.
The experiment involved 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two were to solve an unsolvable problem.
Of course, both failed.
But the group that washed their hands after failure seemed much more optimistic than the group that didn't.
The "washed-handed" group also performed better in the next test than the other group.
Yet, those who washed their hands scored worse in subsequent tests than those who did not.
The results of the 'washed' were at the level of the third group, whose participants had not experienced any previous failure.
The results of the test, according to psychologists, show that physical cleanliness eliminates truly negative feelings of failure.
But at the same time, motivation is declining, and the test takers are having to concentrate much more in the next test.
If we transferred the results of the research to the Czech Republic, we'd probably be most optimistic after we get back from the toilet.
Only one percent of Czechs do not wash their hands after using the toilet, but a fifth of them do so when using public transport.
They also tend to follow the rules of hygiene after working in the garden or in the workshop, where 85 percent of people wash their hands.
Petting a pet motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference between the perception of Czechs and Slovaks of the need to wash their hands after shaking hands with a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"While it would be appropriate, I'm afraid the reality is different and people are trying to make themselves a little bit better", commented dermatologist Claudia Komarková.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is suspending two traders in its foreign exchange division, which is another indication that global investigations by regulators into suspected FX market rigging are becoming more frequent.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with the relevant authorities in the investigation of the world's largest financial market, which changes hands every day for $5.3 trillion.
The two traders would be the first employees of RBS to be suspended in the context of an expanding investigation which is their response to the LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) manipulation scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
"Our relentless investigation into this matter is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other authorities", the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the event reported that RBS had provided the UK Financial Conduct Authority with records of emails and instant messages sent from and to the accounts of the former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been relieved of his current position as European head of foreign exchange trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European head of cash trading at Citi, took a leave of absence this week, while Matt Gardiner, former head of currency trading at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
None of these dealers have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Mr. Usher's messaging team included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, people familiar with the event said.
UBS said this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma announced it was investigating suspected foreign exchange market fraud at several Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide  the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antitrust agency Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority  are investigating the allegations that these bankers have conspired to move the money market.
In addition, people familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had launched internal investigations or received a request for information from the relevant authorities.
Banks are scanning years of old text messages and emails to find cases of any wrongdoing.
Reports of investigations have alarmed traders in an area that has been one of the biggest engines for profit-making in investment bank closures in previous years, but which has been disrupted by the low volatility of currencies that have limited opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the situation by claiming that with a large and highly liquid foreign exchange market it is virtually impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say that may not necessarily be true.
The senior trader said that despite the significant volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the liquidity squeeze between the various trading platforms and banks increasing their use of their own internal platforms means that you can start to influence the market at relatively low prices.
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had fired a stock trader from its stock trading department this week, who had caused a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the competent authorities and is cooperating with their supervisory authorities.
"We believe that this trader acted alone and that the problem has been resolved", Credit Suisse said.
The number of HIV-infected people in Prague has exceeded 1,000
Doctors in Prague have already registered more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the start of the follow-up in 1986 to the end of the third quarter of this year, a total of 1,005 people in the metropolitan area were tested positive.
This is according to statistics from the National AIDS Reference Laboratory of the National Institutes of Health.
According to her, there have been 2,063 cases in the whole of the Czech Republic so far.
In 396 cases, the disease of immune failure has already broken out.
198 people died.
The number of infected people in the Czech Republic has been increasing every year for the past decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, and five years later, it was 121.
In 2009, the investigation revealed 156 new infections and in 2010 180.
Last year, the number dropped to 153, but last year it was a record.
The lab said there were 212.
"I think there is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year will exceed 200", says Miroslav Hlavatý, an AIDS expert who has been the head of Prague's House of Light for Patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011, tests revealed infection in 39 people and 47 last year, Head said.
In September, doctors registered 21 new cases and three female cases.
From the start of the follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests were confirmed in 1,710 men and 353 women.
AIDS has broken out in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
If you really want to know a city, you should go to the cemetery.
His visit reveals more than a stroll through the lavish center of monuments, churches and galleries, more than the bed-sheet would reveal.
Many people "read from the graves".
Slowly, they wander the graveyards and gain intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what kind of people live here, what nationality they are, what religion they are, how large and cohesive their families are, how old they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, what their taste is.
And they will find out from the condition of the graves how the dead are cared for by the remnant.
The Supreme Court upheld the Obama health care law
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the health care bill signed by Barack Obama is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
By a 5-4 vote, the court ruled that the individual regulation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  that requires citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014 or face a fine  is not unconstitutional on the basis of government taxation.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also upheld the remainder of the 2,700-page law, further ruling that the statutory requirement for health care that requires states to expand access to health insurance otherwise threatened to lose all federal health insurance funding was unconstitutional and unenforceable.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Businesses to block the law.
During the 2012 primary, the bill was strongly rejected by every major Republican candidate, including the presumed proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
"Mugabe is a lame ass" is no longer a prison sentence, the court struck down the law
Until now, Zimbabweans have had to be very careful about how they speak in public about the 89-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s, and since the end of 1987.
Under section 33 of the Penal Code, contempt of the office of the president was punishable by a fine of $100 and up to one year in prison.
"Public prosecutors should not be so eager to accuse people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places", declared the Constitutional Court officials.
The nine judges unanimously ruled that the law undermines freedom of expression.
The government is likely to appeal the court's decision, the BBC reported.
The law has been loudly opposed by a number of injured Zimbabweans, including Tendai Danga, who was arrested by police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president during an argument with a police officer in a bar.
In May, an opposition activist who publicly praised Mugabe as a "loose donkey" ended up in prison.
In August, the prosecutor charged a 26-year-old man with intent to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as toilet paper.
The court also declared a law restricting freedom of the press unconstitutional.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements later turn out to be false", said Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwean law allowed for a 20-year prison sentence for publishing false information.
"The existence of a law that allows criminalising someone for making false statements has a chilling effect on the right to free speech", Malala added.
Despite Mugabe's hard-line rule of the country for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with broader civil liberties in a referendum in March.
The country's small steps away from one-man dictatorship began in 2009, when an agreement between Mugabe and the opposition elevated Morgan Tsvangirai to the post of prime minister.
However, the country continues to suffer from an economic crisis and, until 2008, the highest inflation rate in the world, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, the government therefore abolished the national currency altogether.
Today, Zimbabwe is only paying in foreign currencies.
The impoverished economy is being driven by Mugabe's reckless agricultural reforms.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience in farming.
Central banks will hold swap lines permanently
The temporary and bilateral arrangements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument that will allow banks to access global currencies whenever they need to.
The banks stated this in their joint statement.
"It's a very sensible move", commented Julian Callow, chief international economist at Barclays Bank in London.
"Meanwhile, all the transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so it is not surprising to me", adds Vojtěch Benda, chief economist at BH Securities.
Central bankers are tightening the shackles that began to form in 2007, when the international credit market first contracted.
Central bank agreements gave access to euros, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The central bankers' decision comes as the US Fed prepares to end its economic stimulus program, which could push the price of money on the global market even higher.
A swap contract is normally used to overcome the liquidity shortfall of one currency while the liquidity surplus of the other currency is present.
It can be understood as the deposit of one currency and the borrowing of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in European banks.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will supervise 150 banks.
How Tipsport does not delete personal data.
Over a year ago, I registered on Tipsport.cz.
But I didn't finish that one because there was someone sitting at the branch who couldn't finish the online registration.
And because I didn't want to go to another branch, my registration failed, so I moved, and that changed my address and my ID number.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that I couldn't because I have a different P.O. number, an address and that it just couldn't be completed and that I should request deletion of the data and make a new registration.
So I did, and on October 24, 2013, I wrote to technical support requesting the deletion of all my personal data from the database under the current data protection law.
So, tech support texted me the other day to finish the registration at the branch.
This started a marathon of emails to tech support, where they finally wrote after the 4th emergency on October 25th that they had deleted the personal data at my request.
So you would think that you could do that new registration and here the problems started again first it said that my username was already taken (I understand it wasn't deleted - it's not personal data, but in the end they also deleted this).
So I used a different username and it occurred to me that my personal data had already been saved so I could complete my registration at the branch (how could they have saved something they claimed to have deleted?), so I contacted technical support again.
When I asked how it was possible, they texted back that they had actually deleted the personal data on the 25th of October and asked me to send an email with the error.
I did that (around 3 p.m. yesterday) and I got a reply today that I had registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 1.22 p.m. and that's why it's not possible because I used the same name and date of birth.
How about I've been contacting tech support for a week and I'm still not getting it.
And what about the fact that if what he says is true (which it isn't) no one could register with the same name or date of birth if that's already registered.
Just by the way, at 1:22 p.m., I actually registered, same name, same date of birth, but I used a fake e-mail and phone number, and, amazingly, a page popped up that e-mailed me a link to complete the registration.
But how is that possible if you can't register under the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport ties the registration to the e-mail and phone number and the data just didn't get eliminated like they claim.
So again I told the tech support that they're just lying (either intentionally or they don't know what they're writing) because what they're writing isn't true.
I've verified several screens that the registration issue was before October 31st, so a "fake" registration simply doesn't affect this.
Tipsport wrote back a stern sentence: "I'm sorry, but since you're already registered, we can't verify your claims".
And he's cut off his communications.
The same sentence is repeated over and over again, that the registration is tied to the name and the date of birth.
They can't even accept the fact that the registration wasn't completed by clicking on that link in the email and so it didn't actually happen.
So, to sum it up, Tipsport not only didn't erase the data as he claims, but he's lying when he claims otherwise.
What's worse is that they can be easily proven to be lying and trying to make it look like the fault is on the customer's side.
By the way, after I mentioned this issue on my personal blog, things got a little bit moving and an email came from Technical Support that they were passing the matter on for review and I would be informed (after a week of urgency and arguing and alerting to the same error).
♪ There's music playing on the subway ♪
The Prague Transportation Company (DPP) has launched the project Music in the Metro.
The first vestibule where instrumental music is played continuously during the operation of the metro is the A-line bridge at the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The test run will take six months.
Michal Horáček presented his new double album, band and three singers
The songwriter Michal Horáček brought not only his brand new two-CD Czech calendar to the hall of the Cologne City Social House, but above all in the programme Between Us singers Lenka Nova, Františka Segrada and Ondra Rumla accompanied by the excellent Matěj Benk Orchestra.
After the opening intro and the acting study about the late musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, he came with a candle in his hand and recalled the story of how they last played in Cologne and the theater and the whole city went out of power.
"There were two types of cards in Cologne that I came into contact with a lot", he recalled.
He also reminded me of President Zeman's countryman.
"Maybe we could do a tour of the Zákolany or the Dobrovce near Bratislava", he joked about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage and sat at a table with a glass of wine when he was not speaking, touched his new musical work.
Josef Manes made the calendar, put it on the clock, about ice hockey, but he had no idea at the time, how we meet in those squares and chant, who doesn't jump, is not Czech.
That's the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we're not playing it here today", he said.
But Ondra Ruml sang a very appropriate song for him from this album, Sleeping by Day, Singing by Night, and accompanied him on guitar.
Otherwise, when he wasn't singing, he played percussion, and all three singers were accompanied by a band of keyboards, cello, guitar and double bass.
All three singers sang a little bit of a refrain to the side of the heart that immediately spread the audience.
"I'm glad you liked the song, which didn't surprise me in Kmochov", Michal Horáček responded.
After the memory of Peter Hapka, I Recognize was performed by František Segrad, in the original by Richard Müller, which was rewarded with a huge applause, the song Dad liked Lida Barova reminded Hana Heger again, with Horáček's explanation of the communist ban and Barova's replacement by American actress Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocába was again reminded by the piece Sebastián, Segrado then sang a beautiful piece of Prague composed by Jarda Svoboda, a native of Szczemock and former Kolínák.
But that was the end, a standing ovation and an optimistic addition to the song "We Live in Wonderful Times".
There was one more addition to the playlist, but it was not applauded by the fans.
Almost immediately after the concert, the four of them sat at a table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček's books and even the cover of the legendary LP and with any interested parties.
Berdych and Štěpánek are joined by Rosol and Hájek.
In the Davis Cup final against Serbia, the non-playing captain of the Czech tennis players, Jaroslav Navrtil, nominated Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czech national team is defending the trophy, but they are going to play on the opponent's field in the Belgrade arena, where the match will take place on hard ground from November 15 to 17.
The Czech Republic is in the final for the third time in five years.
"We know we're going into hot ground, "that it's going to be wild, "and we need to focus on our performance as always".
"We're going there with one goal - to get three points and sell the best", said Štepanek, the winner of last year's final against Spain.
The secret wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training Obama on how to bomb Syria.
The American command in Libya.
Top Gun in the Gulf.
The Israelis have demonstrated exactly what bombing Syria looks like.
Without any unnecessary hype, threats and millions of statements, they sent out planes, they hit the target and they came back.
Without hesitating to officially remove chemical weapons from Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole thing and they don't talk about it anymore.
The exact opposite of the confused and arrogant, unsupported actions of Obama's Syria policy.
And the most satisfying thing about the whole attack was what the Israelis were bombing.
Don't be fooled by the media's claims that "Syrian base" or "Hezbollah supplies" were bombed.
I wrote here recently that while US aid to secular rebels in the country remains on the rhetorical level, Russia happily continues to supply arms to Syria.
And it was a fresh shipment of Russian missiles that landed at the port of Latakia that became the target of an Israeli airstrike.
That's a clear message.
And notice, again, Israel bombed the Assad regime, not the rebels, although according to popular Internet theories it should be the other way around.
The U.S. government has identified two members of the Space Force, possibly Delta Force.
It was not known until now that they had been prominent during the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi.
There's a known heroic death of two former SEALs who defended a CIA compound in the city, and I believe they were members of a secret CIA command made up of ex-soldiers.
It's been long speculated what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even at the CIA's other residences.
It's clearer now.
Anyway, the information that the CIA has offices in Libya protected by machine gun nests (in one of which both SEALs died after being hit by a mortar) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about these two hitherto unknown heroes.
They were part of the American command in Tripoli, and as soon as they got word of the attack in Benghazi, they volunteered to intervene and, along with five private contractors, they cleared their way to the CIA compound in Benghazi.
The Obama administration is confused by the fact that during that attack, the command was not officially deployed and that they were just hesitant about what to do.
The commander of the command, without orders, will probably release these volunteers.
Anyway, the fact that there's a permanent U.S. command, CIA agents and private contractors in the country is quite interesting information.
And that's because until recently, there was no official acknowledgement of this, and even now there's talk of some kind of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it's a good thing that the U.S. is halfway through fighting terrorism in Libya.
Although, to solve the nationwide situation, it would take a lot more help.
The last place of secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
Not so long ago, the media almost praised the Iranian Air Force for chasing down American drones.
But little is known about how the Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to find your drone in the air, there's nothing you can do about it.
But if an Iranian drone is discovered in international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom chased an American drone into international waters, in what may have been the first acute deployment of an American super-fighter F-22 Raptor in history.
He flew the Phantom to optically verify his gear without the Phantom ever registering on the radar or even noticing him, and then when he suddenly appeared at his house and called the Iranian pilot to come home, he obeyed without complaint.
No wonder the Phantom is an American-made aircraft, but it remembers the Vietnam War.
He can't compete with the Raptor.
We want to show that Pilsen can still win, promises Rajtoral
It's a bit of a paradox.
While his team has been mostly unsuccessful in terms of results lately, defender or defender Viktorie Plzeň František Rajtoral has the form that brought him back to the national team after a year.
He's good at shooting, he's active, he was given a penalty kick in a match in Teplice after surgery.
Viktoria reached for victory in the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplice, but in the end she took only one point from these two duels.
Francis Rajtoral believes his team will break the series against the Jablons.
We want to show we can win.
"I believe we can beat the Apple at home", promises Francis Rajtoral.
The men are preparing carefully for a tough match against the North Czechs, who are playing offensive football.
Everything is going to be fine for the game against the Apple, the coach is preparing us well, as always, and we're also drawing a lot from the video analysis of the opponent's game.
"I believe it will be a great match on Friday night", the Czech representative attracts fans to the Doosan Arena stands.
Plzni's last few games didn't go the way she'd hoped, but the word of crisis from the defender Victoria refuses.
That's the way it is in football, sometimes you're in good shape, sometimes you're in worse shape.
But I wouldn't talk about a crisis.
"I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good again", the defender of the Wests says.
Victoria's team will once again rely on the support of the fans.
"It's Friday night, and I'd like to invite our fans, who are great".
"I believe we will repay them with a victory", adds Rajtoral.
Step back, please.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step, it's a big leap -- a few years back, back to my childhood.
It's a reminder of what it was like to have no worries and just come home from school and do the dishes and the waxing and the homework.
Although these "obligations", it was mostly just theory, the wishes of the parents.
The practice was completely different - running out of school, throwing the bag in the corner and running out.
Play ball games with the other kids, jump the drink.
Then on the show, Helena and her boys chain-stitch a party napkin for Grandma's birthday.
And then after several warnings to finally wash the dishes, to wax, to put wood on the brick stones in winter and to do homework under the lamp until after dark (or to rely on a classmate and instead of homework write love poems addressed to school love).
In the morning, I ate homemade strawberry jam (a real fruit, not the kind of jams that are sold today that contain strawberries) and drank it with dried herbal tea that my mother and I so loved to collect.
I also remember those magical evenings when there was grave silence in the bedroom, when my sister and I would record songs from the radio to tapes that were playing loudly on my mother's old cassette player.
And then we would print the tapes on pencils and play the same song over and over again, our favorite song, and then we'd drink to that with a siphon.
Or we would use the table to make telephone calls using cans that were tied together with a string - and while we were talking about making phone calls, to make it easier to hear, we had to thoroughly clean our ears, and the earplugs were sulfur plus cotton.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live off it so that we lacked nothing.
We didn't need any of those iPhones, iPads, or even cell phones and laptops or branded clothes.
Clothing was passed down from generation to generation, and the best addition to the wardrobe was a batik-coated T-shirt made in-house with the help of SAVA.
We were satisfied with the electronics, including my mother's cassette player and, at best, the Walkman, which my sister and I shared and which we used only on the train on a school trip.
We thought it would be more interesting to play "Hop Hat" with Aunt... or "Man, don't be mad", or as I said, "just go out".
When I was a little older, we had a video player under a tree, and I'm sure my parents saved a lot of money on it, but unfortunately it didn't last long.
My little sister put an oyster in it, said it was so cute, so she tried to see if it could sleep with the oysters.
Unfortunately, he fell asleep, but it was his last bite.
Well, that's still on his plate, poor thing, from his dad all the time.
She says when Lenka was little, she would stumble into a video and think she'd play the recipe and she wouldn't, which is why she can't make it to this day.
I remember how we all communicated, how we all got along without cell phones, computers.
My sister and I arranged to meet next summer at my grandmother's house with the neighbor's granddaughter during our vacation, and that was the way it worked.
We're all gathered together.
Promise someone now that you'll see them in a year?!
I also remember the winter when we'd run outdoors with the whole village, building snowmobiles, riding on the snow-capped hill by the church on bags filled with hay.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the day.
Of course, before each meal, my sister and I would hear the well-known phrase, "Go wash your hands!"
Yes, that's true today, but I'm sure you don't have soap in a lemon net tied to the bathroom faucet.
After dinner, while Dad was "working" in the garage for beer with Yarda from the village, Mom and I would lie on the floor, rest our feet against the brick stove, open the door and look at the flame and listen to the crackling of the wood as it was sliding out of the stone.
We were closer -- really -- we didn't count how many friends we had on social media, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated -- we talked -- we didn't text each other every day through different chats, text messages.
There was nothing like it, and yet we knew so much more about each other.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It's a beautiful memory, especially when I fill in those memories by looking through albums, where the black and white photos are carefully glued together by the black corners.
And in case I didn't know how old I was, the year of the photo is always written on the back.
I see that although the potty haircuts didn't suit us very well and we had cousin's pants two digits larger, no one had laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd rather go back to that step forward, to reality.
By 2013, I'll be waiting to see what the modern age will come up with for my kids one day.
What I know for sure is that these memories of mine are now at least 100 years behind the monkeys for the younger generation, and I think they're missing out on a lot of that pre-monkey time, too.
I wish they did!
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents for the now-defunct Nortel, filed patent infringement lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone makers including Google, the company it auctioned off in Nortel's bankruptcy.
The Rockstar Consortium, which bought Nortel's patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei, and four other companies in the U.S. District Court in Texas for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents include technology that helps to link internet search terms to relevant advertising, the complaint states, which is at the heart of Google's search business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which competes heavily with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google raised its bid several times, and eventually offered up to $4.4 billion.
After Nortel was defeated by Rockstar in a patent battle, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal motivated in part by Motorola's patent pool.
'Despite the failure to obtain the disputed patents at auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe the patents', the complaint states.
Rockstar seeks increased damages from Google because it claims that Google is intentionally infringing the patent, as claimed by the claim.
The smile of November
It came from outside, 4 degrees Celsius, which we're not used to.
First she put away the smile, the one she always wore as a defense against the wishful friendly environment.
She was relieved, because it was a mask she chose not to wear in public.
He was only honest at home on the days when she was babysitting and had grandchildren Elinka or Adik around.
And, of course, when her sons called.
She remembered the lesson from the endless business skills courses very well.
Now they're finally really useful.
So she doesn't upset her loved ones.
Then he went into the corner.
Like a disguise for a masquerade.
November, no other moon can do the miracle of actually smiling like they did on the trip with the one who's been gone for almost three years.
Egypt inaugurates first freely elected president
Muhammad Morsi has taken the oath of office, but his triumphal day is hardly going to end the political turmoil in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was inaugurated as the country's first freely elected president, after Hosni Mubarak was ousted 16 months earlier.
When appointed to the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He swore before 18 judges dressed in black robes in a palace overlooking the Nile, reminiscent of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic", Morsi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"The Egyptian people today have laid the foundation for a new life of absolute freedom, true democracy and stability", said Morsi, a 60-year-old US-educated engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of sharp attacks by governments for most of the 84 years since its inception as an illegal organization.
When Morsi arrived in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 a.m. local time, hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to celebrate the president, and unlike the presidential pomp of Mubarak's era, traffic was briefly halted to allow the convoy to pass through the usually busy road connecting the city center with the southern suburbs.
Morsi's personal prestige, derisively dubbed the uncharismatic spare tire of the Muslim Brotherhood, has grown sharply since his victory and his Friday speech, which was intended to present him not only as the candidate of the Islamists but also of all those who want to end the uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state", Morsi, dressed in a blue suit and red tie, told the judges in a wood-lined chamber where he was taking the oath.
Morsi later traveled to Cairo University to deliver the inaugural address.
While standing guard, he received an official welcome from the military band playing the national anthem.
The military commander, Field Marshal Hussain Tantawi, was brought in.
His arrival was accompanied by the chanting of "Kharmad" and the people are one handed by the hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Cairo University was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later became a stronghold of Islamic student movements in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and solemnly promised to reclaim the presidential powers stripped from him by the military council that took over from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take the oath of office in court, rather than parliament, as is customary, he has submitted to the will of the military, suggesting that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi's speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
There'll be police specialists in the ghettos, trying to defuse the tension.
In the future, police specialists should be employed in the ghettos of the Czech Republic.
They'd spend half their time here.
They'd keep order and solve problems.
They should contribute to reducing tensions between the people of slums and the people of the surrounding areas by their environmental knowledge.
The Home Office is counting on it in their proposal to reduce security risks.
He said that the main thing that would help improve the situation in the country would be "the accelerated provision of social housing".
The document was negotiated by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 slum houses and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
They were home to 80,000 people, mostly Roma.
Adults in the ghettos were out of work, families were dependent on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
There was a lot of interest.
Experts at the troubled sites say it's increased by a hundred.
Relations between their inhabitants and the rest of the world are becoming more tense.
In several places anti-Roman marches were held.
The extremists were joined by people from the neighborhood.
According to the insiders, it is difficult for the police to maintain security and order in ghetto areas.
The key condition is 'the consistent application of equal access to law enforcement'.
But they say that without a thorough knowledge of the place and the people, it is impossible to achieve that.
A specialist would go on assignments in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half his service, the rest serving in his own circuit.
He'd be the one to keep the place clean.
He'd also know the locals, so he could handle problems or misdemeanors better.
"The trust will make it easier for specialists to prevent a whole range of illegal acts", the ministry said.
Specialists in ghettos would receive a monthly stipend of 500 to 1,000 crowns.
The deployment of special police officers to the problem areas is to be financed by Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (about 15.5 million crowns).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the amount, the funds 85 percent.
The preparations started this year, and a detailed proposal is now being worked out.
The project is scheduled to run until 2016.
The writers were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied for several years in Slovakia, where the problem of socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roma settlements", the report's authors stated.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer is to be found in an analysis that will determine where a special agent might be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release each year for these officers after the project is completed.
According to the draft, the selected police officers are first trained in Slovakia.
Five dozen members should be trained annually.
They'll make the most suitable candidates.
Special training should also be provided for police officers who will operate in ghettos.
The authors suggest that social housing is the main factor that would help to improve the situation.
It's supposed to motivate and lead to integration.
According to the interior design, it would have three categories.
The minimum standard would be accommodation with well-defined rules, such as the number of persons per room.
The average would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard would be social housing comparable to ordinary housing.
Tenants would have to follow an integration plan, which would be drawn up with them by social workers.
They would have to follow the rules of accommodation, take care of their health, send their children to school, retrain and actively seek employment.
If they tried to integrate, they would move to a higher standard of housing.
The housing scheme should operate for at least 30 years, according to the interior, until the next generation grows up "in a pro-integration environment".
The social housing model is being prepared by the Department of Local Development and Employment.
They're supposed to draft it by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: The Coal Mountain - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Coal Mountain is a prominent hill three kilometres southeast of Bruntal.
Along with several others, it is evidence of volcanic activity in the Low Asenik in recent times (from the geological point of view).
The last eruptions here were at the beginning of the Quaternary.
When viewed from a greater distance, the baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of Help, built in 1755-1765, is conspicuously whitewashed on the top of the Coal Hill.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn next to the church didn't survive.
Shortly after the church was completed, a four-row alley was planted, about 1 km long.
The crossroads on the Coal Hill is the third version, the original was here after 1916, the second from 2001 lasted only until 2004.
At 15 stops there are wooden plaster casts made by the local artistic carver František Nedomlel.
He used different types of wood from the Low Autumn region.
Similarly, the rock beds of the area provide an interesting geological exposure.
Each stop is marked with the name of the sponsor.
The coal mountain is the remnant of a young volcano.
Although radiometric dating varies slightly, the last eruption was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is younger than the Great Red (age 3.3 million years) and older than the Venus volcano (age 0.8 million years).
The volcano was born by explosion.
It spewed a considerable amount of volcanic ash along with fragments of rock from the floor, which burned to a reddish-brown color.
At the end of this phase, lava flowed to the surface - a layer of porous limestone that is up to 40 feet [13 m] thick today.
The second eruption produced red, reddish-brown, and in places, black tuffs.
Their layer is powerful up to 50 meters and part of it is accessible in the wall of the quarry.
The tuffs are marked by volcanic plumes up to 1 meter in size.
At the end of the activity, lava flowed out of the volcano, which now forms a powerful layer of crustal ash up to 50 m (160 ft).
Volcanoes that alternate between erupting volcanic ash and lava flows are the most common type of volcano.
Because they're actually made up of layers, they're called stratovolcanoes.
The original volcanic cone was gradually eroded.
However, it was only threatened by mining in the quarry on the south side.
The most intensive mining took place here in the years 1953-1962.
The tuffs were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
Under pressure from experts and the public, the mine was stopped and the unique site was preserved.
The problem is the porosity and poor cohesion of the rocks, which are rapidly weathering, breaking up and moving down the slope.
The hole is disappearing pretty fast.
To complicate matters further, the warm, south-facing slope is ideal for some rare species of plants and animals.
So, the repair is problematic, but over time, it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles are maintained at a number of key sites.
The Coal Mountain can be reached by a green tourist sign from Bruntal or Silesian Kočov.
Motorists can use the free parking at the beginning of the lip avenue, where a short learning path also begins.
She moved from the villa to the pancake house.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a mansion with a garden and swimming pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villa districts on Ořechovce.
However, the original owners of the house got it back in restitution, and the tenants had to move out with a small discount.
So Ivanna quickly sought out a place to live for herself and her aging mother.
She got a tip from her acquaintances for a 3+k flat in an older panel house on the other side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor of the vast forest park and the dam on the other side excited me", recalls Ivan.
At first I thought it was a three-year internship.
"We have lived here for over 13 years now, and I would not change it just for the sake of a gradual renovation", adds the owner.
A mother and her daughter were moving from a 100-foot [100 m] apartment to a smaller one of 62 square feet [62 m], and they gave away almost all of their equipment.
The event was not easy, the items were stored at friends' homes and the gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in fairly good condition, but necessary adjustments had to be made, such as painting the doors and replacing the windows.
The previous owner had blown up the core, but the owner was most concerned with the impractical and unnecessarily large lobby, and the small bathroom.
The two rooms were combined to create a multifunctional living space.
The architects used cardboard to define the zones and divide the room, which allowed for a new placement of the lights.
The first operation she undertook after a few years was to remove a curb in the living room.
This changed the layout of the apartment to 2+q, but the room gained air and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step towards partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of PVC flooring with laminate.
Ivana was a bit overwhelmed with the bathroom.
For years, I've been picking up housing magazines and looking for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting realization.
So I consulted a young architect named Kamilla Doudérova.
"It was actually the most important step for the future", says Ivan.
The bathroom was rebuilt to accommodate the lobby.
The architect combined the bathroom and toilet, and replaced the two doors with openings with one sliding door, saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also fairly barrier-free.
The quality of the covers is a sandbox, plus a comfortable seat in the shower, and a bidet shower by the toilet.
The successful cooperation with Kamilla Doudere continued.
As part of the program How a dream is built, a quick but fundamental transformation of the living room took place, in which the architect Martin Čeněk also participated.
We had to bring three functions, dining, living and sleeping, into the space that was created by connecting two smaller rooms, without using the traditional principles of optical partitioning, such as semicircles or Japanese walls.
"This would ultimately violate the openness and unity of the space", explains the architect.
We were able to separate the sleeping and the living area originally.
All you had to do was turn the backs of the two sofas together and put a custom-made bedspread cabinet between them.
The dining area is defined by the shades of the floor and the paintings.
The architect used quality marble on the kitchen and dining area floors, and she brought the sliding doors to life with patterned wallpaper.
The kitchen corner shall be covered by sliding panels with wallpaper if necessary.
The new anti-allergic marble floor has a number of advantages over the previous laminate floor: a softer, non-slip surface without seams and better sound insulation.
The system of spaces and sidings in cardboard, highlighted in color, is an example of how space can be worked on in a panel.
I left the painting to the architects, wishing it was fun.
"I like orange, the same shade I had in my previous apartment", says Ivan.
The graphoglass cladding with a flowering magnolia motif is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
For the warm, energetic tone, the architects chose white, which emphasized the modern functional style.
The small apartment was able to store books in a space under the window sill, among other things.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are conveniently controlled remotely.
The new interior is a fine contrast between the old and the new, such as the decades-old glass chandelier and the fine art objects that Ivan has collected throughout his life.
The kitchen came last.
The cabinets were previously placed on either side, and the owner felt a bit like she was in a tunnel.
The architect took their numbers and rearranged their layouts.
The furniture is custom-made in a simple design, the white surface is smoothed by a slightly pearly surface.
The washing machine, dryer, and washing machine were designed to fit into a small space.
The small kitchen was brought to life by the full-glass walls over the countertop.
The unique graph glass with a digitally printed motif is attractive, and it is also very well maintained.
Ivana chose magnolia flowers that remind her of her favorite neighborhood where she lived for years.
Now she seems happy here too.
The original bathroom had a small bathtub and sink, and the new owner chose a neutral shade of decoration.
The big shower corner has a glass door, Ronal.
The aim was to create a clear, simple space from the environment in which the functions and devices would be in harmony.
We combined the interior materials and colors to try to make it look elegant, cozy, not too crowded.
"Another condition for the assignment was a barrier-free solution with minimal obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and the accessibility of everyday necessities", adds Kamila Douděrová.
The Supreme Court has ruled that time is not a crime.
The Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Nečas can also be prosecuted for possible criminal acts he may have committed before the August dissolution of the Parliament.
He was only protected by the immunity from prosecution that applies to speeches in the House.
In the case of former ODS deputies Ivan Fuks, Mark Schneider and Peter Tluchora, on the other hand, the Supreme Court ruled that they could not be punished for possible criminal acts until they gave up their parliamentary mandate in November last year, said Supreme Court spokesman Petr Knötig.
By this decision, the Court rejected the request of the Prosecutor of the Republic, Mr Ivan Istvan, who wished to continue the criminal proceedings against the Members.
He said that they had accepted bribes in the form of lucrative positions in state-owned companies in exchange for giving up their mandate and not making any trouble in passing laws.
On the contrary, the former prime minister who offered them these posts could be prosecuted further.
Vít Barta and the anti-corruption police officer were also arrested
Barto's lawyer Oldrich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption of VV deputies, also did not want to comment much on the case, but said: "Yes, I represent the client in this case as well, but due to the protection of classified facts I cannot comment further".
According to the information, the case is being handled by the General Inspectorate of Security Forces (GIBS).
The server of tn.cz stated that Bart could have bought classified information from the police.
According to the server prvnizprava.cz, the case may be related to the case of former police chief Peter Lessy, whom Bart allegedly sought to appoint to the post.
But the latest intel from the law shows that the detention of Vitt Barta is not related to Peter Lessy.
Police spokeswoman Eva Kropáčová declined to comment, saying the case was being handled by the Prague City Council.
"We will not comment on this question in the light of the protection of classified facts", said on Friday the law spokeswoman of the City Prosecutor's Office in Prague Štěpánka Zenklová.
It is the prosecutor there who is supervising the case of Barth, and it is thus implicit from her words that the file or the criminal proceedings are being conducted in a secretive manner.
Novinek reporter was able to reach Vít Barta's wife Katerina Klasnova in the morning outside their residence in Prague's Klaárová.
She was just packing her bags and leaving.
She refused to comment on the whole thing.
On Friday morning, the leader of the Dawn Movement, Tomio Okamura, spoke out about Bart's arrest.
He says he has no idea what the case is about.
"Vit Barta was one of many candidates from many parties for our candidacy, and as I repeatedly said before the election, he was not and is not a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy Tomia Okamura", he added.
Vít Bárta, who unsuccessfully ran for the Dawn of Direct Democracy movement of Tomia Okamura in the last early elections to the Plzeň Region's parliament, is known for his corrupt bribery of public affairs MPs.
In April 2012, he was wrongfully sentenced to 18 months with a 30-month suspended sentence.
Later, the sentence was reversed, and Bart was acquitted.
I want an NHL contract.
♪ I still have the passion, the lust and the passion ♪
For Prospala, family has always been first, so at 38 he wants to submit to it fully.
Either he gets a job overseas and extends his career, or he's out of hockey for good.
"I want to be a father and a husband".
"I'm really looking forward to it", says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for the offer.
Even though he's a hard worker who never cheats.
Even though he leaves a heart on the ice every time and can pull his teammates off.
And also despite the fact that he was the most productive player in Columbus last season.
"But the desire to show everyone is still in me", he declares determinedly.
He might make it, reportedly the New York Rangers, who have a losing season and two injured power forwards, Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
What's it like coming to the Rangers?
It's just speculation.
Until I have something on paper, there's no point in going into it.
I know there's an article in the New York Post saying they should sign me, but that's it.
Nowhere else did it say that it had happened.
I'm sorry, I'd like to announce that I have a contract, but I just don't.
You haven't heard from the club?
That's the kind of communication that happens every day in the NHL.
That's where it's about getting into the situation where the deal really comes.
When a player gets hurt or someone doesn't get it and the mancheft doesn't get it.
There's a lot of different factors that have to come together to get me that contract.
But that's exactly what happens in New York, isn't it?
Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan are down, and the team's out of the season, so there's a chance, don't you think?
Of course, the odds are always stacked.
The other thing is, you always need two sides.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't gotten one yet.
That's the reality I have to live with.
You're flying to America on Friday, you expecting something to happen?
I've had these expectations since July 5th, when the NHL free agent market opened, and still nothing.
You're going to New York to remember?
No, I'm going to Tampa to see my wife and kids.
I look forward to the sunshine and seeing you again.
Do you have your schedule in place?
It's because I'm a father and a husband, and that's what it's all about.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm gonna be a dad and a husband, and I'm really looking forward to it.
Your boy's got two hockey games on Sunday, so it's a holiday for me and my whole family, when we can go support our kids in whatever they want to do.
You think you could do this in the in-laws full-time?
Yeah, you can think about a lot of things.
This could happen.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 games for knee surgery.
And I had a lot of fun.
It gets to the point where all the goals and wins and draws don't replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's what life is about.
You can have whatever job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could have happened to me besides my family.
You've had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play in the NHL just because it's the NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
As a hockey player, I put my sporting achievements first - besides my family.
The NHL is the best league in the world.
And family life is a result.
My children, I'm sorry, our children -- my children and my wives -- grew up in the States, went to school there, and so on.
And we'd love to see that trend continue.
Because, as we're gonna tell ourselves, in America, the options are somewhere else.
That's the chance we should give them.
So you plan to stay in America permanently?
We'll practice it as we have.
That means we'll be in the Czech Republic in the summer.
And in the winter, in Tampa or wherever our footsteps take us.
It's perfect, being always warm.
I've been very lucky in my life.
I mean, I went up against him, and it took a lot of strength and sacrifice and took away a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey has offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where we live.
There are a lot of people in the world who crave this so they can choose what they do and how they live.
How long will you have the will to work, train hard and wait for an offer?
Yeah, well, that's a question I can't answer.
I still have it in me today, the juice, the desire, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and the motivation to prove to people that you're still in the NHL, that I'm still better than everyone else.
But I can't tell how long it's gonna be there.
You can't plan that.
So you're saying you're gonna wait this season, see how it turns out, and then decide what to do next?
I'm in the day-to-day phase.
The Commission notes that the measures in question are not compatible with the internal market.
He explained this by waiting for the new State energy concept and the approval of the Contract of Difference by the government.
For these reasons, the current CEEC leadership is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - i.e. as the majority shareholder.
A qualified manager should make recommendations to shareholders, not hide behind them.

CNN: Israel has bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli military aircraft reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
Citing an unnamed U.S. government official, CNN reported.
The Israeli press reported extensively on the explosion at the alleged missile storage facility, but the Israeli government has not confirmed the attack.
An Israeli military spokesman declined to comment on the news of the airstrike.
"We don't comment on foreign media reports", she said.
The target of the Israeli airstrike was rockets and related equipment, which the Israelis believe could be transferred to the Lebanese militant movement Hezbollah, according to a US government source.
The AP, citing another U.S. security official, said that the Israeli airstrike on a target in Syrian territory targeted Russian SA-125 missiles.
Israeli TV channel 2 reported that the target of the attack was reportedly a highly advanced Syrian air defense system.
But satellite imagery of the attack area showed a battery of Russian S-125 Neva missiles, according to DPA.
In addition, they reportedly saw a battery of SA-3 missiles, including a command center with radar to track missiles and their targets.
The missiles, according to an Israeli TV report, are designed to fly 35 kilometers and could carry warheads weighing 70 kilograms.
Israel has reportedly bombed missile deliveries inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and AP reported.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly stated that it will strike any arms shipments destined for Hezbollah or other designated terrorist groups.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company updated its annual profit forecast and expects record profits from recreational boats in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual basic profit before tax to be between USD 325 and 340 million, compared to USD 305 to 315 million from the previous forecast.
If current trends continue, this will represent a 12 to 17 per cent increase from the record profit of USD 290,4 million in 2011/12.
CEO Graham Turner said Flight Centre generated an 8% profit in the first half and in the second half began a sharp rise, mainly in Australian and UK non-business travel.
"As of today, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading for record annual profit before interest and taxes", he said.
This includes Australia and the UK, which are traditionally our biggest profit-makers.
Recreational activities recovered in Australia during the second half of the year, compensating for the slightly weaker domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre did well in the leisure sector, while business customers spent less.
US business has recovered from losses during the seasonally weak half of the year and is expected to return to full-year profitability for the third consecutive year.
Flight Centre's stock was up 3 cents yesterday at $38.20.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transferred to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained since September in Russia for protesting the planned Arctic oil drilling have been transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
This was reported by AFP today, citing the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
It also claims that the original charges of piracy against its activists have not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women detained in Russia following a non-violent action against an Arctic oil rig have been transferred from a correctional facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg", the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for the transfer of the detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA, it was a planned transfer.
The environmental authorities initially charged them with piracy, which could result in up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
But last week, they announced that they're replacing the charge with a lesser charge of disorderly conduct, which carries a lower sentence, with a maximum of seven years in prison.
But Greenpeace has warned in a statement today that the charges of piracy have not yet been dropped as promised.
That means the detainees are now charged with two felonies.
The powerful Investigative Committee announced last week that they're replacing the piracy charges with the riot charges.
But when 30 prisoners appeared before the committee this week, the piracy charges were not dropped.
Instead, new charges were brought against everyone", Greenpeace quoted AFP as saying.
The Russians detained three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries at the Gazprom oil rig in mid-September.
The environmentalists were on the Arctic Sunrise, which was flying the Dutch flag.
Since then, they have all been held in custody, against which they appealed, but the court rejected them all.
Environmentalists are complaining about the conditions in the prison.
Greenpeace Executive Director Kumi Naidoo said today that the move to St. Petersburg will make it easier for detainees to meet with their families and consular staff.
However, there is no guarantee that conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact they can be worse", he pointed out.
One of the detained activists, Faiza Oulahsen, asked the Dutch king Willem-Alexander for help.
In a handwritten letter published today by the Algemeen Dagblad, she urged the monarch to discuss their situation at a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It claims that Maliki has a large role in the renewal of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is also partly the result of fighting in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on math, spelling and grammar
English literature classes will require studying at least one Shakespearean play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onward.
The test will also include 'hidden text' to motivate further reading;
Combined English literature and language courses will be abolished.
From 2015, students will be required to take a language exam and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an elective.
The Department of Education is scheduled to release the new curriculum for English and math tomorrow, the first subjects to undergo a radical change.
Other major subjects are due to change next year.
In a separate step, Ofqual, the authority that oversees the final exams, will reveal changes to the structure of the final exams, along with a new grading system and a smaller number of projects for students.
In his speech this summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there was "a broad consensus on whether we need to reform our test system to regain the trust of society" and that there was a need to insist that the high school test be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies show that English schools spend 116 hours less time in maths per year, or three hours a week, than most other countries.
By comparison, schools in Australia spend an average of 143 hours a year in mathematics, and in Singapore, about 138.
While no official demand will be made for more time spent on math, coalition sources said that the extensive high school math exam  coupled with a greater emphasis on the subject in the results rankings  is likely to encourage schools to provide additional teaching.
The curriculum will focus more on 'real world problems', including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Mayor Kajnar: I am not the cancer in the CFSP
Before the elections, a long-simmering dispute between two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrov-Czechoslovakia SSR was in full swing.
It all came to a head when Ostrava Mayor Petr Kajnar filed a lawsuit for undemocratic candidacy.
The case-makers, however, did not want to say much about it, lest they hurt the party even more before the election.
But now the votes are counted.
The leadership of the Ostrava CSDP called on the mayor of Ostrava to resign from the party on Monday evening, and will probably press for him to lose his position.
But Peter Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
What the controversy is about and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview with the Daily.
How do you feel about the election?
I'm sure the S.H.I.E.L.D. was counting on a much better result.
Did it hurt her in our country that there was a media controversy before the election?
I can imagine that social democracy could have had a better election result.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state of the SSSR now.
It's a party that has its internal problems, it's internally sick, and people perceive that everything is not right in it.
They made it clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of the SIDS?
I think the ODS has been in decline for some time now and unfortunately the same thing is happening in social democracy.
The thing is, the lobbyists, the influential people who had previously expected to find their prebendas in the ODS, have moved to the people in the CIS and are influencing them.
It has to do with the police going around the Ostrava Magistrate's office and collecting computers.
It shows that the SSSD is not just made up of people who want the good of everyone else, but many of them think first of their own good.
The ČSSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps in Prague, as seen in the current power struggle between the Hashkovs and the Sobotkovs.
But even that was a long time in the making.
What happened before the election in Ostrava was just a foretaste of what is happening now in Prague.
The Hashk wing has gradually taken positions, so that after the elections it can create a situation that will weaken the Sobotk wing.
You're in a situation in politics where you have to compromise sometimes.
But everyone has an inner limit to when they can't compromise, and that includes me.
I didn't want to run for the House of Representatives, but when I saw the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Lubos Zaoralk that I would try to get to the regional candidate, to strengthen Sobotko's wing as mayor of Ostrava.
But the hashish wing put a stop to it.
Why are you on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka and not Michal Haska?
Slavek Sobotka is a man who always talks about the CSDP program and, to a certain extent, about the vision for the party and for this country.
I confess I've heard nothing of the sort from the other side.
Michal Hashek is just fighting for power.
I don't understand how the Bureau, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can just start to dismiss the party chairman.
It's a struggle for power against all odds and against the party's rules.
I think what Michal Hasek has done in Prague has ended his political career.
How did you feel about the fact that the Ostrava leadership did not approve you as a candidate?
Political parties are based on a contest to see who gets to be the second-place candidate.
The competition should be based largely on the programmatic visions and the ability of the people to realize those visions.
Of course, there are people who don't have much ability or vision who are in this race, but the political party is an elevator to money they wouldn't get anywhere else.
The problem is, when these people start to get ahead by ruthlessly violating the rules, violating the party charter.
They're making political parties into mafias by their practices, and I think they're violating the laws of the Czech Republic.
Bringing attention to this issue is more important to me than considering whether any Kajnar has any political future.
It's important that the parties start respecting the statutes.
So that's why you filed a motion to the court before the elections for a preliminary injunction against the appearance of the CSDP candidate in the Moravian-Silesian Region?
The current district executive committee of the CSDP in Ostrava is consolidating its power by being able to abolish organizations that do not suit it, purposefully founding new organizations, gradually expelling uncomfortable party members.
For example, they wanted to expel Richard Bednarik from the club, but he filed a lawsuit against it, and they then decided to cancel his expulsion.
This shows that enforcement of the party's statutes through the courts is the last option, but once the other means and control bodies within the CSDP have ceased to function, it is the only option.
The Ostrava CSDP leadership, led by Adam Rykal, is trying to remove you from your position as mayor.
It is a public secret that the mayor of Poruby, Lumír Palyza, has a crush on this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can to get me fired.
They promise people positions, they get votes, and then they consolidate their power in the party.
If I go back in time, everything that happened around the football club Baník Ostrava and the purchase of the Bazala stadium was just a pretext for them to attack me.
It was staged to make me look like a man who puts money where it doesn't belong.
In doing so, the city has purchased a property that is of strategic value to it.
So, how do you see your continuing as mayor?
On Monday, the District Committee invited me and others to consider staying in the CIS.
But I think it's like a thief screaming, "Catch the thief!"
If you look at the results of my work over the last 11 years, I don't see anyone in the social democracy of Ostrava who would initiate and push, sometimes even against party members, the creation of so many development things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of the science and technology park.
And yet, everything is becoming uncomfortable.
I don't read it any other way than I'm preventing others from getting into places they want.
Will you continue to fight these efforts?
Because if this republic is going to work, then the political parties have to work.
I can hardly believe that any party can effectively run a country if it can't even run itself.
So I'm not considering leaving the SSSD now, because I think that the one who's causing the cancer of this party is not me, but these people who are trying to piss me off.
Olomouc opens a public ice rink in the historic center
The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating, Pavel Spaleny, said that the preparatory work on the rink was started on October 26 and that an ice-making unit has been in operation since Wednesday.
The ice sheet is already seven centimeters thick and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The ice rink has an area of 375 square meters, the podium took 358 square meters.
Two punch stands will also be available for rowers and passersby.
"We have expanded the floor area, increased the area in front of the stands, and almost the entire floor area is roofed so that skaters can comfortably slide", described Burnt.
The streets of Olomouce are already resembling the approaching Christmas.
Last year, a skating rink was installed in front of the main entrance to the Town Hall in Upper Square to repair Lower Square.
The repair of Lower Square was completed at the end of the summer, so that the ice surface could return to its original position.
The first time people could skate directly in front of City Hall was in 2009, when the ice rink was in operation from January to March.
The ice rink then became an integral part of the city's Christmas markets.
The Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural programme, will open in the Upper Square a month before Christmas Day.

The brutal murder of a senior in Zlínsk will be reopened by the district court
The district court dismissed the charges of a 25-year-old Slovak and a 22-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men have denied the charge.
They're looking at 15 to 20 years in prison or even a special sentence.
Spokesman Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the Supreme Court had overturned the decision of the Regional Court and had returned the case to the Regional Court.
The judge declined to comment on the reasons for this, saying that the decision had not yet been served on the parties.
According to the prosecution, the youths assaulted a 77-year-old man in his home.
Senior died a painful death.
According to the prosecution, the men strangled, beat, and kicked him throughout the body and also struck him with a metal object, possibly a gas pistol, and inflicted about three dozen blows to his head.
The man suffered severe injuries, including skull fractures, brain swelling, or a brain hemorrhage, which caused his death.
The young men reportedly took away about $3,000 and jewelry worth about $5,000.
According to the district court, the only, and only indirect, evidence against the defendants was the odor traces, which the expert assessed as not fully detected within the meaning of the legal guidelines.
Although the scent marks from the scene of the crime and on other items matched the defendants in more than a dozen cases, the police initially treated them as scent marks rather than material ones.
In addition, some mistakes were found in their handling.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the defendants has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
The elderly man was found dead with his head broken by relatives who thought he may have fallen and injured himself.
Not even the emergency services doctor called in the violent deaths.
It wasn't until days later that the forensics team contacted the medical examiner who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
The police couldn't work with all the clues from the crime scene that the relatives had cleared.
No DNA from the defendants was found at the scene.
The young Slovak was living in Uherskohradištka.
He is now serving an eight-and-a-half-year sentence, which was upheld by the Olomouc Supreme Court last year.
He said the man was the head of an organized group of six young men who were responsible for robbing jewelry stores.
The robberies took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of the senior in Slopny.
The younger of the accused for the murder of the elder lives in the Uhersk Hradišt.
The court released him in August after 11 months in custody.
Znojmo starts the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, reconstruction of the football stadium in Znojmo will begin.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by a construction crew who will renovate the lawn.
The reconstruction of the municipal stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages in order to meet the standards for the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter will close next week with Strings of Autumn .
Saxophone legend and jazz legend Wayne Shorter will be making his mark next Wednesday at the 18th annual Autumn Strings Festival.
Shorter will perform on November 6th at the Grand Hall of Lucerna with his quartet of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening Shorter will be joined by a spontaneous jazz improvisation by the PKF - Prague Philharmonic under the direction of Martin Kumžák.
Shorter's arrangements for symphony orchestra include Pegasus from his novelty album Without A Net, as well as his earlier works Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August, Shorter is still full of energy, which is also proof that the Prague concert at Strunny Autumn will kick off his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the music world over 60 years ago.
The list of artists he's worked with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock to Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey he also met Czech musician Miroslav Vitouš and Viennese native Joe Zawinul, with whom he was the director of the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade.
For the past 13 years, he has been performing mostly with the Wayne Shorter Quartet.
There's going to be an after-party after the festival, a club night called Spotlight, which will be held on November 9th at the Roxy/NoD Club.
Alongside charismatic singer Andrey Triana, the local audience will be introduced to the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin with their jazz-influenced electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring an electro-jazz formation inspired by dance styles.
Damkovsky is reportedly prohibiting UEFA from publishing penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chairman of the refereeing committee of the Czech Football Association, has stopped publishing the penalties for referees.
She is prohibited by UEFA rules, which she stated in an interview with Pravda.
Otherwise, he'd be facing punishment.
Damková also refused to side with the football players of Pilsen, where she comes from.
These speculations are really ridiculous.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in the case of voting I can lose 1:6, " said Damková in response to criticism, which was outraged after Plzeň recently played twice as many penalties as other league teams.
So although the FACHR has stopped publishing the sentences for referees in recent months, Damková assures that judges regret their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the committee finds out that the referee made a mistake, they will restrict his delegation, no matter what the match", Damková declared.
The reason why the penalties are not released is because, according to Damka, he's banned by the European Football Union.
'UEFA prohibits the publication of such information and severely punishes infringements.'
"We're very suspicious, and we look for something behind every mistake".
"We published the restrictions, but I got two very strong warnings that if we don't stop, there will be tough sanctions", Damková said.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really the exception", she added.
If the information were to continue to be published, the Commission could lose money from UEFA for the education and development of referees.
"And they are very important to us".
"Without them, we could not complete the referee training program", added Damková.
The arrest of Barta is related to Janusz and Bém: is he behind the leak of the wiretaps?
The chairman of the Public Affairs Committee, Vít Barth, was arrested by the police on Thursday.
He was detained along with the head of the anti-corruption police department, analyst and computer scientist Jan Petržílek.
The arrests are related to the interrogations of lobbyist Roman Janouš and former mayor Pavel Béma (ODS).
The information about the intercepts, which came with the server Novinky.cz, was confirmed by the Czech Press Office by a reliable source.
The intercepted phone calls of Janusz and Béma, published in March last year by the newspaper Mladá front Today, in which the two men refer to each other as "Mazánku" and "Kolibřík", show Janusz's influence on the city's actions under Béma's leadership.
The newspaper said at the time that they had been acquired by the Security Information Service (BIS) in 2007, and that they had leaked to the ABL security agency two years later.
Bart owned it back then.
The server of Novinky.cz pointed out that the detained criminal Petržílek worked for the BIS before joining the anti-corruption police.
Petržílek moved to the anti-corruption unit, which subsequently handled the intercepts, at the same time as they were published.
"I can't confirm anything or say anything at all with regard to the law on the protection of classified information", said prosecutor Michal Muravský from the Prague City Prosecutor's Office.
He also refused to confirm that he was overseeing the case.
The case is not open to comment for the same reason.
Six out of 10 companies are preparing for the new Civil Code
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
Only eight per cent of the companies surveyed said that they had not addressed the issues related to the two key codes at all in their company.
This is according to a survey by Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which asked 108 Czech companies for their opinions.
With the two key codes coming to an end, many managers are only now beginning to realise at the last minute how significantly they can affect the way their companies operate.
The biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Because of the politics of the lavirate, the business sector has long been uncertain whether revolutionary changes will eventually come or not.
"However, they now have only a few weeks to make the transition to the new law smooth for their companies", commented Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal partner Jan Spačil.
Of the 61 percent of companies that are intensely engaged in new legislation, 26 percent said their firms have already taken all necessary steps to be ready in time.
Furthermore, 35% of these companies are planning to take the necessary measures in the near future.
In contrast, one in five companies has not yet been involved in recoding, yet has a concrete idea of how to prepare for it.
Eleven percent have no opinion and cannot judge the issue.
Only eight percent of companies admit that they have not yet addressed recoding issues.
The most important legal issue related to the new Civil Code is the conclusion of new contracts for the largest number of companies surveyed (21 percent), followed by the resolution of business conditions (16 percent), and then changes in the real estate cadastral and liability for damage (after ten percent).
One of the most significant developments in the whole recodification of contracts is the unification of the regulation of contracts only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil and Commercial Codes will disappear, and as a result contract law should become more transparent for citizens and businesses.
"For entrepreneurs, the new arrangement will offer many new features with an emphasis on greater freedom in the way of relations", pointed out lawyer Lukáš Poddaný, of Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
In the context of the Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the accountability of statutory bodies to be the most important issue.
The topics followed were changes in the convocation and course of the general meeting (15%) and company representation (14%).
The new legislation means a tightening of the obligations and possible implications for statutory bodies, in particular in situations where companies are threatened or are facing insolvency.
"In practice, this means that if the members of the board and the managers of the companies do not act with the care of a good steward and do not avert the impending collapse of the company, they may lose the benefits gained from the performance of their functions in the last two years", added Spačil.
Pierre Rainero: I try to make Cartier's style evolve as a living language.

This French luxury house dates back to 1847.
It travels through mud, river and jungle, providing free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
In West African countries, there are not many doctors; only one for every 5,000 people.
Vote here or on your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 contenders for the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year award.
In the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year contest, you can vote for him or any of the other top ten nominees.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious over and over again, and drive to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, Cameroon's capital, in 1981.
At first he was treated with only a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that spread to his brain, where it created a hematoma that plagued him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon", says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received the kind of treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy", says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00 in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since the death of Bwelle's father in 2002, things have not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
Just for comparison, the rate in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people.
And even if doctors could visit Cameroon, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the health care spending in this country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty", says Bwelle.
They can't enjoy life because of poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he started the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he has helped nearly 32,000 people with his volunteer group.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others rush into vans, attach medical supplies to rooftops, and travel through rough terrain to villages in need.
They don't always have luck.
The vehicles have to push through the river and the mud at one time or another.
But when they arrive, they'll be greeted like true heroes: feasting, singing and dancing and the best accommodations the community has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is a real cause for celebration, and Bwelle  with her broad smile and unbridled energy  is very willing to join in the local cheer.
The next day, the team starts treating hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on each expedition", says Bwelle.
They're coming to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers, and they're walking.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide a variety of medical care.
Many are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive free crutches or donated glasses or a birth certificate - a document that the school requires but that many impoverished families simply cannot afford.
Tonight, the team performs a simple operation under local anesthesia.
Surgeries are usually done in a school building, at city hall, or at home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery area to make room for another patient.
With the help of generator lights, operating rooms, and sanitary equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning.
It's exhausting, but the village musicians usually help the team to keep motivation.
"They play drums all night long to keep us up and going", says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team heads back to town, tired but proud of their work.
This group - made up of Cameroonian doctors and international medical students - performed 700 free operations last year and they know that their help can mean a lot to the local population.
One man said he'd be able to work again after his kidney was operated on.
"This will change the future of our family", said the man.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and working as a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
He says that this second job is what funds about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I'm not sure when she actually sleeps", says Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia who volunteers for Bwelle's group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it's a great practice they wouldn't get at home.
"Dr. Bwell's hands were thoroughly washed and bloodstains removed or we held his tools", says O'Malley.
You'll never experience that as a second-year medical student in America.
Student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But once they arrive in Yaoundé, Bwelle provides them with food, transportation, and education.
"He is a hero, without a doubt", says O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
Bwelle's constant pursuit is no burden to him.
Helping others to live happier lives, fulfilling the promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy doing this job", says Bwelle.
And I think about my father.
I hope they see what I'm doing.
To make people laugh, to ease their pain. That's why I do it.
Take a look at the ASCOVIME website and find out how you can help.
Minister Holcát has resumed the position of Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic
The main nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100 thousand.
"I think it is essential that these functions are clearly defined and formalized so that nurses have their representative within the structure of the office - a representative to whom they can always turn if necessary", explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of the nurses and I think the nursing profession deserves to be given the proper attention from the Ministry.
The exercise of this profession requires not only high professional standards but also a human approach and personal conviction.
"I will gladly and responsibly promote measures that can improve the position of nurses".
"We have excellent and skilled nurses in our healthcare sector, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us much with their approach to patients to carry out their profession with empathy and help us improve the public image of nurses", says Alena Šmidová.
The newly appointed Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic Alena Šmídová also stated on the occasion of her inauguration that she wants to deal with various aspects of the position of a nurse and intends to cooperate with professional associations, professional societies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors, among others.
"I don't want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but rather see them as standing side by side, each with their own competences, and together with other healthcare professionals as a team that provides healthcare for the benefit of the patient".
"I myself face many of the problems that arise in the practice of nursing, and I recognize these difficulties and intend to contribute to their solution".
These include, for example, ensuring the simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
"From my own experience, I know that some administrative tasks are unnecessarily burdensome and take away the time that nurses could and should spend with patients", says Alena Šmidová.
Other areas it intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways to better collaborate within the team and with the management of healthcare providers, adjusting competences, and also labour law issues such as compliance with the Labour Code or not burdening nurses with insufficient numbers at a given time and place.
We often hear anonymous reports, but for fear of possible retribution, they are not documented in a specific case where there might be a violation of the rules.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, and so the function of the Chief Nurse of the Czech Republic could serve as a guarantee of anonymity in this case and allow the competent authorities to investigate the specific case", concludes Alena Šmídová.
Msgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Secondary School of Medicine in the field of Nursing (graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University in Prague in the study program Nursing - pedagogy (graduated in 1992).
Since 2010, he has been Head of the Department of Nursing and other non-medical disciplines and Recognition of Qualifications at the Ministry of Education and Science of the CCP.
During her professional career, she worked as a nurse at the Internal Department, and later as a teacher at the Secondary Medical School, where she was also the statutory deputy director for 8 years.
She was the head nurse of the Czech Prison Service from 2004 to 2009.
She has published several nursing textbooks and articles in professional journals, and has lectured in nursing.
She's not a member of any political party.
So I don't get caught up in hate
The writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After many years of reading, living, but not writing, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes a new novel Wind, Darkness, Presence.
The number of pages suggested by the book is comparable to his best-known work, The Household (Petrov, 2001).
Another prominent Czech writer of the present time - Emil Hakl - spoke for Salon Kahudu.
What made you write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it - to avoid being trapped by hatred.
Seeing around us ever new clones of human foolish petty-mindedness, young organisms afflicted by blind selfish pursuits.
Not to mention us old people, faces ruined by helpless lust, soul-sparking, and ideologues reversed in their pools, trying to sell their "product", as little sales whores are called.
At the turn of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and I filmed my weird friends, weirdos and hidden entities.
I'm over that.
Sometimes I feel like my brain is burning from living on this planet.
I like to go for walks and then read a book by the lamp in the evening.
You're talking about feeling resentful, hating.
Was there a break in your past that affected you, or are you just getting older like the rest of us?
The break happened a long time ago, about ten years ago.
It didn't have a name then.
Well, I lived by it.
But there's still a surprised quiet boy in there somewhere.
I see other lonely trainees, each in their own tornado of anxiety.
Writing books saved me.
I will be part of this huge, thousands of years long movement of the life system on this planet - the birth of an unfathomable future.
The immense, breathtaking complexity of life, where every stone is a direct inheritor of our present.
We are players in a sad and beautiful game where by trial and error, the next generation of beings, the next generation of beings, in trillions of interactions per second, create some kind of superhuman, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a long time.
Do you see your writing as a continuous process, or did you start from scratch?
Self-talk, or rather, dialogue, conducted by the right and left hemispheres of the brain, sometimes comes to the surface and forms a book.
As periods of peace are interwoven with the still sleeping metastases of wars that may one day wake up, so my book is twelve years of silence clothed in words.
I felt a silent avalanche of life grow in my brain, and if I didn't do something, one day it would quietly fall on me.
It's a set of questions that the brain has formulated and put them into layers that are stored in the darkness "below the consciousness level".
The neocortex, the gray cortex, is questioning the older evolutionary formations, going back to the ancient cycles of the brain tree.
He speaks to the furry beasts, he asks the serpents, he seeks the answer in the flight of birds, he looks up to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law within me and the starry sky above me.
In the end, the brain asks the world.
You're a relatively frequent metaphor for ego - could you define it biologically?
The brain stores in its billions of connections and electrochemical bonds all the memories, experiences, and experiences that the person has had.
This forest of logically and emotionally exposed and branching information trees, memory registers, using the brain in its recognition, cognitive process, is exposed to the ever-changing present, in a relentless effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes there's a congestion problem.
Similarly, if you dropped your PC, from a program like a speech emulator and a foreign language translator, you would be entangled first in an operating environment like Windows, and after a few failed restarts, you would end up with the dark green flashing screen of the BIOS, the underlying system that controls functions and collaboration on the motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory, etc.
For those of you who haven't figured it out yet, I'm talking about a psycho-spiritual crisis.
You mention it often - why do you care about this kind of regression on a regular basis?
Because it's a pit.
In the matching of the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling, and behaving, a breakthrough occurs.
It's good to find Nietzsche here: "He stared into the abyss so long, that the abyss stared into him".
A sense of loss, of being lost, of all hope, of psychic death, of the emergence of a new quality.
And why do I care about it personally?
I'll answer with a parable.
One day, he fell into the mud and drowned, and days and months and years passed, and he kept drowning and reading, and those books taught him how to swim - to live.
He became a "diver".
I hope someone can use a sentence I've written, as the Count's lyrics once helped me.
To what extent do you think about the reader, the specific person who will read your text?
The one about which nothing meaningful can be said, some call it consciousness, another super ego, but I think Arthur Rimbaud best characterized it in a letter to a friend:
"I am someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of word and sentence formulation".
From an early age he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in Captain Nemo's submarine, ran in the Stínadlechs in dark alleys.
Anyway, at the end of all the author's twists and turns and their message, it says, "The sun shines on other worlds".
What if the book's out?
Do you care what the reader thinks?
The feedback that comes to you through people reading the book?
Of course I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of text.
And then, maybe years later, people just randomly contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with some of the hard choices in their lives with my book.
Books are actually "lives" or rather "worlds".
They're encoded in letters, they carry the experience, the history of the regions of the language.
We can wake them up anytime we want by letting their sentences flow into their brains.
It's actually, in a way, something forbiddenly divine -- to awaken more and more life stories, little universes and temporary planets.
It's a reality whose DNA is embedded in stripes - according to old demonology books, we practice witchcraft.
After the book is published, as it often is, you have a chain of author readings.
I remember you used to like to read.
Are you gonna throw yourself back in with joy, or do you feel differently after all these years?
I'd rather just tell it now.
And what did I learn?
There are good, intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic characteristic is that they're inconspicuous, they don't draw too much attention to themselves, they have a friendly air, you don't feel lonely with them.
For example, in the town of Red Bones there lived (and I hope he still lives) a furry bookseller (he is aptly named Red), a cheerful companion and a good bull girl.
At a drinking establishment, he introduced me to individual articles in the chain of readers of my book The Hustle.
I looked them in the eye, and then I was shown a shredded, read copy of my book.
Embarrassed, I put down the morning cloth I had just read and wept briefly as a man.
We all stood there in silence, waving and weeping drunkenly.
Then the young blond mixed-race couldn't take it anymore and screamed and jumped out of the window into the snow.
It was downstairs.
We ran out into the night landscape and ate the happy rage of the sensitive, the aching soul of the country folk and the sob of the reclusive patriots - howling and wailing like werewolves until the morning.
Each of your books is different in form and content from the previous ones.
Does that apply to the lyrics of "Wind, Darkness, Presence"?
It's a story.
It's a tale of one land behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
In his novel Suchodol, Ivan Bunin puts the words of an old Russian fairy tale into the mouth of a folk healer: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Buyan.
There's a dog, with a grey coffin.
The horror, the terror, the mystery.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Maybe we were devils in hell once, drawing lots to see what part we'd play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to let the flow of inspiration flow again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Marchina.
Writing is a wonderful form of dialogue.
Something enormous and unnamed, like the movement of the continents on the planet, influences our will so deeply and so widely that it completely exceeds our horizon - and so, quite naturally, we act exactly in accordance with the intentions of our programmed task.
We're rewarded by an influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We are biological machines.
We want to mate, we die defending and gaining new personal territories.
Sometimes a disorder occurs and we radiate compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves human.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders, standing on the shore of the ocean unconsciously, catching the tides of the wet wind in a piercing sail made of dirty towel.
I have to write to be human.
Obama is backing out of health care.
After a wave of criticism, President Obama backed down yesterday from his oft-repeated and ambitious promise that if you like your health care program, you can keep it.
Citing hundreds of thousands of news reports from the providers, Republicans have accused the president of deceiving the American public in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama backed away from his original promise.
"The vast majority of people who have a working health insurance can keep it", he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to what he called a media uproar over the revelations, Obama urged Americans who had received the announcements to seek new insurance in the marketplace.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program at the same price or even cheaper than anticipated.
"You'll get a better deal", he said.
His administration says it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who have purchased insurance for themselves may be forced to change the program because their insurance doesn't meet the new requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
"I say this to these Americans straight up: You deserve better", Sebelius said in her testimony before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace has been "miserable" since October.
"I'm disappointed and angry like everyone else", she said.
I'll try to win back your trust.
An agitated Sebelius made this statement, picked up by a bug, yesterday to the counsel sitting behind her at yesterday's committee meeting, which was held after a heated exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, about whether she herself should be included in Obama's care program.
For more than three hours during the Sebelius hearing, he repeatedly asked why the architect of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance and buy the program through HealthCare.gov that is now being imposed on millions of Americans.
Which billionaire are you gonna be on the phone with next year?
Kellner, the owner of PPF Group, wants to buy the O2 operator.
Both firms have confirmed the deal, and various sources, both inside and outside, say they're already in league.
The transaction should be notified as early as November, probably before the start of the LTE auction, i.e. before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the measure with the internal market.
To everyone's surprise, there was no mention of the company's desire to break into telecommunications.
But now Sazka is run by a very experienced telecommunications executive, Robert Chvátal.
He started as head of marketing at Radiomobil (now T-Mobile), later became director of Slovak T-Mobile and lastly headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
The deck plays several cards at once.
She signed up for the auction and now she's admitted she wants to run a virtual one at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If the auction is successful, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
This would not normally be pleasing to Vodafone, but according to information from the Economic Times, it may be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from a deal with competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, which will share their networks completely.
Vodafone needs a partner, you know.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the LTE network tender (as a newcomer it can auction specially designated spectrum), Vodafone will not have to take part in the auction at all, or will not mind auctioning only limited spectrum (there are not enough frequencies for all).
Vodafone can share the network with Saška.
Vodafone will launch Sazka on its 2G/3G network (i.e. the newly built 900 MHz LTE network), which will allow the company to start the network quickly.
In the meantime, Sazka will start building an LTE network for freight, which Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
The money saved could then be spent by Vodafone on some fixed internet provider or cable TV.
What about Kellner?
The purchase of the Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovak branch is a subsidiary of the Czech) would immediately give it a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But then again, it's a big jetty waiting to be restructured.
In the auction, the LTE network would have been acquired by Kellner for O2 and very likely in conjunction with T-Mobile.
The two companies have already declared that they will share the networks.
The auction could thus finally be a success, but probably not with the high sums that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Will Czech TV ever get around without signing events?
The legendary scene of the ashtray has entered the era of President Zemana, so it is not difficult to hear the complaints that gather evidence of the castle's entourage.
In the past, the traded influence of someone like Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdik has never been documented in this way, let alone signed.
Right, the editors came by.
However, the cases described do not answer the question of where the affection of some journalists for the people of Zeman comes from - whether it is a response to a direct order or, to avoid using vulgarism, a typical manifestation of unwarranted empathetic sympathy.
And, assuming the general depravity, it is not excusable to ask whether the situation in television is not being altered by other, no less unscrupulous, interests of power which have not yet had the opportunity.
Those who say that there are no frantic attempts to intervene in broadcasting by politicians in developed countries are right.
The truth is, however, that this does not mean that there are no complaints against the public broadcaster.
The complainants do not question their independence.
Instead, they are primarily critical of what they perceive as a tendency inherent in their subculture.
Maybe we're just not at that stage of civilization yet, and we're not in that situation.
But perhaps in a country that thinks of itself as the most corrupt in the world, black-and-white stories of bad politicians and good journalists are more comfortable than more complicated descriptions of a confusing situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings is confronted.
The curse of this country: presidents on the brink of power
It is almost a rule that at key moments in the country, the head of state was not in such a form as to be able to fulfill his state duties.
If T. Masaryk had been five years younger physically and mentally, he would have lived to see the end of his presidency, and the events around Munich would have been a little different.
We might not have won the war, but after symbolic resistance, the air force could fly over the border, the heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London immediately and not fight hard for its legitimacy.
And most importantly, the nation would not be haunted by the surrender to this day.
Benesch was not a statesman and was still in good shape during the Munich years, but during the war he was already getting off the rails and in February 1948 he behaved accordingly.
If he was a little better off, he could go into exile for the third time and undermine the legitimacy of the Communists and their coup.
It's a shame to talk about Hach.
They voted him out with the "Mr. President won't be in a position to make a decision".
But he had to, although the big decision-making with the knife at Hitler's throat in the chancellery probably wasn't.
The head of the intelligence, František Moravec, until the last days of March 1939 was saying what should be done to ensure that the occupation, which he knew exactly on the day, did not go so smoothly and with such profits for the Germans.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, they didn't trust him, they were afraid.
Human scum Gottwald had his old comrades executed, as Moscow ordered.
Ludvík Svoboda was definitely unable to participate in normalization and they had to remove him, already completely senile.
That Husák was a helpless and sickly depressed old man made things easier in November '89, but that's the only catch.
Havel was lucky to have been out of office for the last few years, spared the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis retiree, but many of his actions suggest that his thought processes are not what they used to be.
Well, now here's what we have.
The head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces looks like what he looks like, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no external threat to the Republic.
Or maybe it's threatening, it just doesn't look like it.
Then the question is, is it exceptionally not (historically) good that the president is not completely in power?
It's not normal.
Can't we elect someone reasonably thinking and reasonably sane as president of this country once again?
Distant planets, black-and-white movies, or a little fantasy about extraterrestrial life on earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would throw away.
In the concept of his quartet, which will close this year's Struny autumn festival on November 6 in the Grand Hall of Lucerna in Prague, everything is connected to everything.
The score of the jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter's quartet is the momentary feelings of the musicians.
His assignment is to have his younger colleagues two generations from now play what they're experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber affair, and they think, not about harmony or rhythm, but in cinematic images.
But this principle is something that the 80-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, a nine-time Grammy winner, a former teammate of Miles Davis, and perhaps the greatest living jazz saxophonist - is reluctant to explain.
He doesn't talk much about music, although his overall outlook on life is closely related to music.
In my 80's, I came to the conclusion that the best way to live is to let life surprise you.
"Too many people plan everything and then get disappointed when things turn out differently", says Shorter.
How Insects From Thailand Boosted Sales at a Paris Bar
You may be crawling over insects, not realizing that you are eating about a pound of them each year on your own.
Like crushed in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are definitely trendy: it's organic, nutritious and you're also given a unique experience.
In early October, the first insect offer in Paris was put on the menu of his restaurant by Elie Daviron, chef and owner of Le Festin Nu.
The bar, whose name was inspired by William Burroughs' book Naked Lunch, is located in the fashionable 18th district near Montmartre, a popular tourist destination.
With fresh avocados, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail eggs, guests can taste not only various larvae, grasshoppers, and water bugs but also larvae.
Carefully packed and specially packaged (to avoid damage to the insect's wings, legs, or eyes) deliveries are sent to Daviron from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, it's common elsewhere.
The owner of a pioneering Parisian bar offers several reasons why insects are the food of choice.
The first is the environmental benefit, since insect production is much less costly for our planet (in terms of finances, space and water consumption) than traditional meat.
"Insects are also an excellent source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids", Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef does not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
He says it's the pleasure, the sin, and the atmosphere of the environment that makes a proper restaurant.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just giving you a new experience", he said.
Not everyone would be thrilled to eat a pest-decorated bug, but the reaction of the customers of a Parisian bar to the insect served is very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics, they say, will eventually taste it, even if they start with the smallest bites and end up choosing a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Czech Construction Business Association Václav Matyáš: The new green economy should continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction industry has been faced with a continuous decline in the volume of contracts and the State's lack of interest in addressing the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings programme was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for SMEs in the regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens, who will save considerable amounts on heating costs after the implementation of the measure, but also for construction companies and building materials manufacturers.
Each billion invested will bring more than 2,700 new jobs to the state.
From the point of view of the State's fiscal policy, leverage and multiplier effects are important and are also one of the most important pro-growth measures.
The Czech Construction Entrepreneurs' Union therefore strongly disagrees with the Government's decision and requests that steps be taken to allow the programme to continue and to announce further challenges.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 to supplement this Regulation.
The dog rolled the rug, the president tripped and ended up on the stakes.
President Miloš Zeman left the Motol Hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night in bed, and went to the castle in Lani.
What's his medical condition?
In an unprecedented admission, John Kerry said that American espionage had gone too far.
John Kerry has hinted at a softening of the US defense posture over its surveillance programs, and in an unprecedented admission said that in some cases espionage has "gone too far".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting on autopilot in the face of the disturbing revelations about NSA spying, which came to light thanks to Edward Snowden's informant.
The release of information has sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry, speaking via video link at an open government conference in London, said: "There is no doubt that the president and I and the rest of the government have actually learned of some of the things that have been done out of persistence because there was that possibility, with reference to World War II, the difficult period of the Cold War and then of course 9/11".
He thus became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had crossed the line, but stressed that it had not violated anyone's rights.
He said, "In some cases, it's gone too far".
And the president is determined to try and explain and clarify this to the people, and he's already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that abuse has occurred.
I assure you, there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this trial.
But Mr. Kerry insisted that the NSA was a good organization and that its surveillance operations saved many lives.
He added: "We are facing a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up".
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to kill and blow up people and attack governments.
What if you could catch it and stop it before it happens?
We've actually prevented planes from crashing, buildings from exploding, people from being executed, because we can already know about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs said Thursday that U.S. lawmakers are heading to Europe to respond to concerns from abroad about alleged U.S. espionage and to convince Europeans that it is still necessary to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he's spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he's concerned about their threats to stop participating in counterterrorism organizations because they're frustrated with the NSA surveillance.
It is really important for US national security interests that Europe stays in the same boat with us in terms of our joint efforts to fight terrorism, said Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
And I'm heading to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together on counterterrorism despite their anger over the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA was collecting millions of phone records in Europe have strained relations with some American allies, though the agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies were collecting and sharing with the United States,
Another disclosure cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA had been monitoring the cell phones of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has advocated Allied espionage as necessary and said it is a matter of common sense on both sides.
In the midst of the uproar, Murphy said his office was planning a parliamentary trip to take place this year, and he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and the chamber.
The names of other lawmakers who intend to participate are to be released in the coming days.
He said the program was still in the works.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to help repair the relationship, he added that "well-meaning educational measures" would also be prepared.
He said European leaders must be honest with their own people about the spy programs they have been using for years.
'While we are adjusting our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also realise that we are not the only ones doing the spying,' Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to respond to the hostility generated by U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance.
Australian woman appeals against stay in Thai prison
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island after falsely claiming she was attacked by a taxi driver appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally charged on June 15 by a state court on the island of Phuket with false charges after Thai police told them that a taxi driver and two other men who were allegedly holding her had assaulted her in the early hours of Sunday, June 10.
However, a television commercial later revealed that after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend, she returned safely to her hotel.
Phuket Island police interviewed Bamford for two days before she admitted she had made the whole thing up.
She was held in a local police cell before her trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security correctional facility on the outskirts of Phuket instead of being placed in an adult women's prison.
She's the daughter of former Australian rules footballer Peter Tuns, who has asked the Foreign Office in Canberra for help in his daughter's case.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about their daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"Obviously, this is a difficult time, but we hope he'll be back safely as soon as possible", Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released on 50,000 baht bail.
Reports from Australia indicate that she was meanwhile vacationing in the Krabi resort in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand say Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was reportedly warned that an appeal could lead to a trial that would increase her sentence and result in her being placed in an adult prison.
But after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be trying to repair the disgraceful image for tourists, which may have been the justification for the acquittal.
Yager was joking, "Gol from the breakaway?"
He got a punch in the defensive zone and no one caught him.
And he turned the escape into a quick forehand clamp.
Jaromír Jagr scored against Tampa on Wednesday night, and on Thursday night, the 119th NHL goal was posted on Facebook.
"After watching this video, my agent, Peter Svobod, was contacted by the director of Czech Railways and asked if I would be interested in doing a commercial for their latest Pendolino train!" he wrote at the beginning with the caption Jagr.
I hear we're very similar in our types.
I guess I'll have to stop night training to keep my speed down.
"I'm afraid the Secretary of Defense might call and want to advertise the jets!" he added with a smile.
And New Jersey has claimed their second straight win.
"Most importantly, you've noticed - Marie Rottr's treatment is working", concluded Jagr.
Candle-shaped post-mortem stew
The October election brought a lot of losers rather than winners.
These are not only parties that did not even get into the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the ČSSD due to their internal division.
Instead of the Christmas candles, the politicians served us the weekend's post-holiday stew.
The election was led by the Andrej Babis movement, which promised voters to change the previous political style of government.
The fragmentation of the election result and the split in the winning party is replacing the political (z) for Mr. President Milos Zeman despite the wishes of the voters, who did not even elect the party that President Zeman publicly supported to the Chamber of Deputies.
The president may have lost his strategic advantage over other politicians because of an unpleasant event, but he still has several ways to regain it - for example, by choosing the next prime minister.
While the chances of the CPSU winning the premiership are getting further away in my eyes, the businessman Andrej Babis is getting closer.
Although the election development is still miles away from the early and smooth formation of a stable government, compared to the pre-election scenario of the leftist government of the CFSP supported by the Communists, this development is still better news for business in the Czech Republic and therefore the economy.
Given the strong opposition of the ANO to joining the ODS or TOP 09, the most likely option is still the coalition of the CSDP, ANO and KDU-CSL (total 111 deputies).
Given the split in the CSDP, which has thus become an unreadable and weak negotiating partner, the outcome of the coalition negotiations may be quite depressing for the CSDP.
A minority government of Czechs and foreigners in the castle is unlikely to pass.
Moreover, any government in which the CSDP will participate will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may lead sooner or later to further division within the party.
So I ask myself, "Are we going to just by accident to another early election?"
The next election would be more of a referendum on the strength of the ANO electoral mandate.
The CSDP's plans to introduce sectoral taxes, increase income taxes more substantially or build a state bank have hopefully fallen under the table.
On the other hand, the parties of the CFSP, the ANO, the KDU-CZL and the Dawn agree, for example, on the promotion of entrepreneurship, a moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), on the promotion of employment of disadvantaged persons, the reduction of the lower VAT rate on selected goods.
The third areas are most common in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
ANO has the upper hand, so the program of the most likely coalition ANO, CSSD, KDU-CSL would lean more to the right.
Which, in my view, is a better result than the left-wing taxation of everything that still moves in the economy.
