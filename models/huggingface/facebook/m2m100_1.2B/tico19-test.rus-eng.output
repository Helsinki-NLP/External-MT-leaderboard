Rapid increase in cumulative coronavirus infection (COVID-19) incidence in the European Union and the UK between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK, thereby confirming that, despite the different stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly growing in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to increase the level of readiness for the influx of patients with COVID-19, who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were recorded in Wuhan, Hubei province of China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the infection was caused by a new type of coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become known as coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to the data available to date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild form of the disease, i.e. in the form of a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, with most people recovering.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe form of disease requiring hospitalization, and in the remaining 6% takes a critical form when intensive therapy is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
This study analyzes the trends of cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) and in the UK and compares them with trends in the Chinese province of Hubei.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK with data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK
After the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and now the COVID-19 pandemic is developing in the rest of the world according to the same dynamics as in China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Mr. Spiteri and colleagues the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met the WHO criteria for the presence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were in France on January 24, 2020 – all three returned from Wuhan, Hubei, China.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 infection have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the UK, with 39,768 cases of infection and 1,727 deaths recorded between 31 December 2019 and that date, of which 17,750 cases, including 1,441 with fatalities, occurred in Italy alone.
Determination of cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates data on the number of COVID-19 cases registered in each country of the world every day at 8:00 p.m. from official sources such as the health ministries of those countries, national and regional health authorities and the WHO.
These data are used to analyze COVID-19 spread trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with data for Italy.
As an indicator of the level of prevalence of active cases COVID-19 was calculated the cut cumulative incidence of COVID-19 over 14 days, taking into account the normal course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the UK for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented a cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8:00 on March 15, 2020, compared with data for Italy for the period from January 31, 2020 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 development trends in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trends in the development of COVID-19 over the 14-day period in the EU/EEA countries and in the UK as a whole corresponded to the trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubei (Fig. 1).
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole began to rise approximately February 21, and on February 28, 2020 there was a sharp jump in this indicator (supplementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases in Italy, but similar trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (supplemental material) were also observed in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK.
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK compared with the similar figure for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already registered as of 8:00 on March 15 in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the UK is comparable to the number recorded in Italy just about 3 weeks earlier.
Our findings show a rapid increase in COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Observed trends in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this despite the different stages across countries, the differences in response measures taken by national public health authorities, and possibly the different criteria for recognizing cases and different rules for selecting patients for testing for COVID-19, including “surrounding” testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy that approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions were already full.
At present, data on admission of patients with COVID-19 to hospitals and/or intensive care units in the EU/EEA are available only for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data is not provided).
However, such data should be systematically collected to supplement current observation data on the number of cases and deaths.
According to a study conducted in 2010-2011, the number of beds in intensive care units and intensive care units in Europe varied significantly from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12,5 beds in intensive care units and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010–2011).
The sixth updated ECDC report on the COVID-19 Risk Express Assessment results presents scenarios for modeling the load of health systems resources with estimated COVID-19 hospitalization data in each EU/EEA country and in the UK where the risk of lack of available beds in intensive care units exceeds 90%.
Since cases are currently grouped by specific regions of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of a specific territorial group, information on infections and beds in intensive care units is recommended to be provided as far as possible by units of level 2 of the NUTS-2 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics).
Italian experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units must be prepared for the contact infection scenario of SARS-CoV-2, which does not diminish for a long time, and for the increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive care, which can be seen, for example, in the affected regions of Italy.
As in the latest ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment Report, a prompt, preventive and integrated approach is of great importance to curbing the spread of SARS-COV-2 with a subsequent shift from deterrence to mitigation, since, given the forecasted rapid increase in the number of diseases, decision-makers and hospitals may simply not have enough time to consider, adopt and adjust their response if such measures are not taken in advance.
The Rapid Risk Assessment Report also lists public health measures aimed at mitigating the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time during which they can intensify their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an influx of patients in need of intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a tragedy for humanity: to date, more than 3,000 people have died in China and elsewhere and the number of infected has exceeded 80,000.
Similar to the homological SARS-CoV virus that caused the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from flying mice and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and has a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people more often than young people, and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article offers an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving subject of study.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis of further course and prevention of the disease.
Although the answers to many questions are still to be found, we hope this review will help to understand and eradicate the dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival (Chinese New Year), which in 2020 fell on January 25, has become an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese people, who, in connection with the outbreak of a new viral infection, were urged to stay home throughout the holiday and for many weeks after it.
Given the high degree of similarity with the coronavirus (CoV), which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 named this virus SARS-CoV-2, and the concomitant disease coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and quickly spread across the country, and then to 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were detected, more than 40,000 patients recovered, and more than 3,000 patients died.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is “enemy number one for society” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 publications have appeared about COVID-19, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report on January 7, 2020, which identified the sequence of the virus isolated from a range of patients.
This review is an attempt to summarize the results of research in a new and rapidly developing field.
As far as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus-induced disease, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS), whose outbreak occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts known at the moment about the prevention and prediction of the course of the disease, as well as some other no less pressing issues.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been among the pathogens that are not fatal to humans and mainly cause about 15% of common respiratory diseases.
Nevertheless, in this century, we have faced two high-pathogenic human coronaviruses, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused the outbreak in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with a terrifying level of disease severity and mortality.
Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, clusters of cases of unknown origin pneumonia were first to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first deaths were recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, it became known about the infection of health workers, which allowed to suggest the possibility of transmission of the virus from human to human.
On January 23 in Wuhan was introduced quarantine, the city public transport stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical trial of the disease showed that 21 out of 41 patients with a confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point for the spread of the infection from an unknown animal.
On January 30, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global public health emergency.
At the time of preparation of this report, the disease spread throughout China and has already spread to about 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and degree of danger of the outbreak is still to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter clinical trial involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented the following updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infection affected all age groups, but mostly people aged 30 to 65 were infected.
Nearly half (47.7%) of the infected were older than 50, very few were younger than 20, and only 14 infected were under 10 years old.
Infection with SARS-CoV-2 among men is higher (0,31/100 000) than among women (0,27/100 000).
COVID-19 was spread by clusters mainly in the province of Hubei and nearby regions.
On average, from the moment of manifestation of COVID-19 symptoms to the diagnosis passed 5 (2–9) days.
The incubation period was on average 4.8 (3.0–7.2) days.
From the moment of manifestation of symptoms to the onset of death, an average of 9.5 (4.8-13) days passed.
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
By January 23, 2020, there was an exponential increase in the number of infected, coinciding in time with large-scale transportation on the eve of the Chinese New Year celebration.
Mortality among patients with a confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10–1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02–4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were: gender (masculine), age (≥60) and severe cases of pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large shell viruses containing one thread of semantic RNA.
They can be divided into four types, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta coronaviruses are known to affect humans.
In the case of infection with coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, the glycoprotein of the shell-shell-like processes (S) binds to the cellular receptors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4) respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.
The genome of viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm; after the replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA together with shell glycoprotein and nucleocapside proteins generates virion-containing vesicles, which then merge with the cell membrane, releasing the virus.
The first reports of the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-coronavirus, whose genome is 99.98% identical to 10 consecutive samples collected at the first outbreak of the disease, at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Using enlightening electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-thin incisions of the human respiratory epithelium.
It has been found that the human enzyme ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human ACE2 enzyme weaker than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe disease in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate a previously unknown short-lived protein encoded orf3b, and a secreted protein encoded orf8.
The SARS-CoV-2 orf3b protein may play a role in the pathogenicity of the virus and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On February 18, 2020, a team of authors led by Zhou presented reports on cryoelectronic tomography of the structure of the full-size human enzyme ACE2 with a resolution of 2.9 Å in combination with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimmer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-proteins, which serves as evidence in recognizing and infecting the coronavirus.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target in drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate host
It is known that the source of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were flying mice, from which the virus was transmitted to humans through cattle and camels, respectively.
Through phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was found that the first hosts of SARS-CoV-2 were flying mice, as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like coronaviruses, namely flying mice coronaviruses SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown what species became the intermediate host, thanks to which the virus managed to overcome the species barrier and infect humans; the way of transmission is also yet to be determined.
Mr. Ji and colleagues suggested that the virus was carried from flying mice to humans by snakes, which resulted in a homological recombination in the S-protein.
According to the results of their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou have suggested that pangolines — long-rise mammals that eat ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine — are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 percent genetic similarity between the coronavirus of pangolines and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference distributed between the two genomes is still very large, so it is believed that the final results with concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (Fig. 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
In laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 40-50% moisture.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and heating to 56 ° C for 30 minutes; effectively block the activity of the virus can ester, 75 percent ethyl alcohol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, acetic acid, chlorophorm and other fat-containing solvents, but not chlorhexidine.
The human population as a whole does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
There are currently no data on detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, primarily SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
As a rule, the host virus is first recognized by the innate immune system through image-recognition receptors (ORRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus provokes the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages in relation to viral antigens.
However, thanks to N-protein, SARS-CoV can avoid an immune response.
Soon, an adaptive immune response is included in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the cells affected by the virus.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protect cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit T-cell functions, causing their programmed death.
Humoral immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in combating viral infection.
For example, the antibodies secreted from the recovering patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the hyperreaction of the immune system entails the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case lead to polyorgan failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by cluster manifestations, is more likely to affect elderly people with concomitant pathologies and pregnant women.
The likelihood of infection is higher for those people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have immune system disorders.
According to the results of the study of data on the first 425 cases of infection in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period lasted on average 3 days, with the spread ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A later study described above, based on demographic data from 8,866 cases, found that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0–7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the timing of introduced quarantine measures taking into account the most accurate calculations of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus by those infected whose disease is asymptomatic.
A 14-day quarantine is common practice for people who have been in contact with the virus or who have been infected with the virus.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often a high fever, which can be the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinitis, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or hypoxia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with high fever and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be checked for the virus for early diagnosis even in the absence of pathologies in the chest images.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 revealed the following indicators of symptom prevalence: 98% - high fever, 76% - dry cough, 55% - shortness of breath and 3% - diarrhea; 8% of patients needed artificial lung ventilation.
Similar results were obtained from two recent studies of cases of infection in the family and transmission of the virus from asymptomatic infected persons.
Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in a study of patients with MERS-CoV, whose main symptoms were also high fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80% of them required artificial ventilation of the lungs, this figure is much higher than among patients with COVID-19, and it corresponds to a higher rate of mortality from MERS than from COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also experienced diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%).
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high fever (99–100%), dry cough (29–75%), shortness of breath (40–42%), diarrhea (20–25%) and sore throat (13–25%), and artificial lung ventilation is required in 14–20% of patients.
As of February 14, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2% and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
Compared to this figure, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic survey conducted in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37% out of 2,494 confirmed cases.
According to a previous study, the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) in the range of 5.71–7.23, whereas R0 for SARS-CoV was in the range of only 2 to 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV for symptoms, mortality and R0 is shown in Table 1.1.
The above indicators indicate a higher capacity for SARS-CoV-2 to spread compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate in case of infection with the new virus is lower compared to the last two.
Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will be much harder to contain than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Cluster manifestation often occurs when infected within one family or group of people who gathered together for some reason or were together on any transport, such as on a cruise ship.
Patients often traveled to Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there, or had contact with infected or sick persons for the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, according to the data presented in the reports, people can be carrier of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and recovered patients, after being discharged from the hospital, can become carrier of the virus again, and this is an alarming signal to extend the quarantine period.
In the early stages, patients have a normal or decreased number of leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 were diagnosed with lymphopenia with leukocyte levels < 4×109/L, including leukocyte levels < 1×109/L, as well as elevated levels of asparagin-aminotransferase and virisemia.
In the blood of some patients, elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin were found, and most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocytes sedimentation in the blood.
In patients with a severe course of the disease, levels of D-dimer, the fibrine breakdown product present in the blood, were increased, and the number of lymphocytes was constantly decreasing.
In most patients with COVID-19 during the X-ray examination of the chest, pathologies characterized by uneven dimming on both sides or dimming of the type of "matte glass" in the lungs were detected.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory disease (ARD).
With the development of ARI, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant disruption of gas exchange.
Type I and II pneumocyte dysfunction reduces the level of surface-active compounds and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung decline.
Thus, the worst results of X-ray examination often coincide with the most severe cases of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated pneumocyte detachment, hyaline membrane formation and intertubular lymphocyte infiltration, and multinuclear syncytial cells in the lungs of patients who died of the disease correspond to the pathology of viral infection and ARI and are similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
As the main criterion in the diagnosis of COVID-19 used the method of detection of RNA SARS-CoV-2 by means of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR with reverse transcriptase).
However, given the high level of false-negative results, which can accelerate the pace of the epidemic, from February 13, 2020 in China began to make a diagnosis based on clinical manifestations (no longer relying exclusively on PCR with reverse transcriptase).
Similar was the situation with the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine history data, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and X-ray results.
On February 14, 2020, a team of experts led by Mr. Feng Zhang described the CRISPR repeat-based SHERLOCK protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2; this technique allows the detection of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at densities from 20 × 10–18 mol/l to 200 × 10–18 mol/l (10–100 copies per microliter of the original sample) using indicator strips in less than an hour without the use of sophisticated equipment.
This new technique, if successfully tested on clinical drugs, can significantly increase the sensitivity and convenience of tests.
Due to the lack of experience in counteracting the previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can basically provide patients with COVID-19 with only maintenance therapy while attempting to apply any therapeutic methods that have been used or offered in the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and providing psychological support.
For treatment, even the plasma of recovered patients was suggested.
Pharmaceutical companies are rushing to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the initial stages, SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs and may also affect other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys, to a lesser extent.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat and cause of death for patients.
Thus, to relieve symptoms and save lives, support for respiratory function is critical, including general oxygen therapy, high concentration oxygen supply, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, which are prescribed depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extra-corporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified method of extra-pulmonary circulation used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintenance of the water-salt balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as protection of vital organ functions is of paramount importance for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that the cytokine storm is a result of the hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
Cytokine storm is a form of a systemic inflammatory process that develops in response to the secretion of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines provoke immunocytes to release a huge amount of free radicals, which become the main cause of ARI and polyorgan insufficiency.
In the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in patients in severe condition, suppression of immunity is of paramount importance.
Corticosteroids and tocylisumab, monoclonal antibodies that serve as an interleukin-6 inhibitor, were used to treat the cytokine storm.
Other methods of treatment of cytokine storm based on suppression of immunity include modulation of the immune response aimed at controlling T-cells; blockage of the production of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of yanus kinase; use of blinatumomab, cytokine signal suppressors 4 and histone acetylase inhibitors.
To reduce the severity of the effects of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants.
However, steroids in high doses are not beneficial in the treatment of severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly worsen the prognosis.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in low and medium doses are recommended for use with caution in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of preparation of this document, there is no confirmed effective antiviral therapy.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, proved to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Later, remdesivir also demonstrated the ability to suppress other viruses from single-chain RNA, including MERS and SARS.
Relying on these data, Gilead has provided the drug to China for pairing trials on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these trials are looking forward to.
In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapeutic options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combined treatment with lopinavir / ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects.
The interaction of these medicinal products with other medicinal products prescribed to patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and production of antibodies
Blood sampling from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease, to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect a healthy population has been used for a very long time.
In fact, the blood of recovered patients often contains a relatively high amount of antibodies to combat the pathogen.
There are antibodies in the immunoglobulin produced by B-lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual molecules of pathogens and neutralize them.
Based on this premise, plasma was isolated from blood samples from the group of patients who recovered from COVID-19, which was then administered to 10 seriously ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, the severity of inflammation and viral load decreased, and blood saturation with oxygen increased.
However, in order to suggest mass application of this method before conducting a specific therapy, unchecked examination and unexplained explanations are required.
In addition, considering the therapeutic effect, some disadvantages associated with the use of plasma should be carefully studied.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune system and cause cytokine-release syndrome, which, given toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and a lot of plasma is needed to treat critical patients.
It is not easy to produce and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to overcome a global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and practical to isolate the B-cells of recovering patients and to determine the genetic code of active antibodies or to conduct screening to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.
So we can immediately move to mass production of antibodies.
For thousands of years, Chinese people have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness largely depends on the combination of many components of the formula, the composition of which varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most effective ingredients are still unknown or have an uncertain effect, as it is difficult to identify and test these ingredients or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific therapy for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate severity of symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe stage of illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest percentage of recovering patients with COVID-19 was recorded in a number of provinces in China that used traditional Chinese medicine to treat 87 percent of patients, including Gansu (63.7 percent), Ningxia (50 percent) and Hunan (50 percent), while Hubei, where traditional Chinese medicine was used to treat only approximately 30 percent of patients with COVID-19, had the lowest percentage of recovering patients (13 percent).
However, this is quite a rough comparison, as the assessment should be carried out taking into account many other influencing factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their disease.
On February 18, 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and his colleagues published research materials that compared treatments exclusively based on Western medicine and combined treatments based on Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.
They found that the time to normalize body temperature, eliminate symptoms and provide medical care in the hospital was significantly shorter in patients who were treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in patients who were treated only by Western methods.
The most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients who began to deteriorate symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the group treated by a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in the group treated only by Western methods (7.4% compared to 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8% compared to 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine still requires more carefully controlled studies conducted on a larger scale and in more regions.
There is also a certain interest in obtaining, if possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the aspects of the effectiveness of the components used in the methods of traditional Chinese medicine, or their combinations.
Patients who are suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 mostly experience a strong fear of acute infectious and even fatal disease, and people in quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and extreme irritation.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment such as corticosteroid insomnia, can cause even more anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of the outbreak of the disease caused by the SARS virus, manifestations of a number of mental illnesses have been, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal behavior.
Mandatory contact tracking and quarantine, one of the measures taken by health authorities to curb the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people’s anxiety and guilt associated with the spread of the infection, quarantine and social stamp on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, suspects and contact with them, as well as to all other people in need.
As part of psychological support, multidisciplinary psychiatric care teams should be formed, clear information with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans should be established, and professional electronic devices and applications should be used to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in breaking the chain of transmission from infected animals and infected people to susceptible hosts and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy used to curb epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work has been carried out on the creation of vaccines based on S-protein, the purpose of which is to produce long-lived and highly active neutralizing antibodies and (or) protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
During animal studies, live weakened vaccines against the SARS virus have been developed.
However, before the start of clinical trials, it is still necessary to determine the effectiveness of these possible vaccines in natural conditions when they are used in elderly patients, the pattern of infection with lethal doses and the degree of protection against infection with zoonotic viruses.
Per the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been since then.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of MERS-induced disease continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the preservation of zoonotic sources in endemic habitats.
Vaccination strategies have been developed to combat MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral-like particles, and elements of recombinant proteins, and some of these strategies have been evaluated on animals.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for people without immunity is an urgent and critical task that requires solutions to curb the tumultuous epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long time (average 18 months) needed to develop a vaccine and the dynamic modification of coronaviruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show a complete picture of the clinical course of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to gradually recover without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with a high rate of complications and high mortality among patients with a severe course of the disease.
In this regard, it is critical for health authorities to develop a disease prognostic model to prioritize their actions, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on data from clinical studies presented to date, the following factors may influence or be associated with the prognosis of the course of the disease in patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the course of the disease caused by the SARS virus, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients aged 30 to 65, 47.7% of whom are older than 50 years, according to the above-mentioned study of 8,866 cases.
Patients who needed intensive therapy were more likely to have underlying diseases and complications, and were significantly older than those who did not require such therapy (average age 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is the prognosis factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 among men is higher than among women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as mentioned above.
In patients with COVID-19, who require intensive therapy, the likelihood of developing acute myocardial damage and arrhythmia is higher.
Cardiological events were also the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been that SARS-CoV-2 may also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may cause liver impairment in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and initial diseases are closely related and can distort results.
Abnormalities identified in laboratory studies: the level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is suggested to be considered as a potential prognostic factor for the course of the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
It was also suggested to consider the relationship between the level of C-reactive protein, the severity of the disease and the prognosis for COVID-19.
In addition, the result can also be predicted by increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase, asparagin-aminotransferase, alanine-aminotransferase and creatinine kinase.
These enzymes in large quantities are secreted by various organs, especially the heart and liver, and their release occurs when tissue damage occurs.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
To predict the outcomes and complications of COVID-19 treatment, along with other factors, radiographical data of the chest and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants widely used in infectious diseases as an additional therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Since corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe forms of SARS, many of the survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis, which caused lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if the use of steroids for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 is necessary, these drugs should be prescribed in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, against the backdrop of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unexpectedly severe stress, because they often have to withstand prolonged periods of quarantine, cope with a high degree of uncertainty and watch the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
In order to relieve stress in such patients and help them return to normal life, psychological consultation and long-term support must be provided with them.
According to demographic studies conducted to date, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different in its signs from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses causing common colds, can successfully multiply in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or not cause symptoms at all in the early stages of infection.
For this reason, those patients who have an early stage of the disease or the incubation period has not yet ended can, while leading their normal life, spread the virus on a significant scale, which significantly complicates epidemiological control.
However, it was believed that transmission of the SARS-CoV virus occurs when patients are seriously ill, although in most cases the infection did not occur at an early stage.
So today’s COVID-19 epidemic is much more severe than the SARS epidemic, and it’s harder to control.
Currently, much work is underway in China, as part of which a general quarantine has been declared in Wuhan and neighboring cities, and a quarantine regime has been extended for virtually the entire population, introduced to break the chain of SARS-CoV-2 spread.
While these measures are causing huge damage to the country’s economy and other areas of life, the number of new patients identified is decreasing, indicating a slowing rate of spread of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic estimates, the outbreak of the disease will end by March, and the stagnation phase will last 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter and colleagues calculated that the outbreak of COVID-19, which looks much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Researchers from a group led by Ira Longini have compiled a model to predict the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two-thirds of the world's population.
A group of Canadian experts that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in nasal and throat patches taken from patients who recovered and were discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, suggesting that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to the flu.
However, the decline in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the strategies currently in place may have had an effect.
According to initial predictions, Ebola fever was expected to affect up to a million people and cause the death of half a million patients.
But due to strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually taken under control.
There is a possibility that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the infecting ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may weaken, and over time it will disappear or turn into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by a high rate of transmission through coughing or sneezing, as well as possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also found in the stool, which means that the oral-fecal transmission method is also possible.
According to one recent study, 41% of the 138 cases studied may have been the result of infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 medical staff.
Therefore, serious precautions should be taken to protect the public, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even strangers in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is wearing facial masks; and surgical masks, and class N95 respirators (series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks do not allow microdrops of fluid from the potentially infected to fly in the air and settle on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) can protect against the inhalation of virions between 10 and 80 nm, they pass only 5% of virions; SARS-CoV-2 is the same size as SARS-CoV, and they are both about 85 nm.
Since the particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks folded together, medical professionals in direct contact with patients must wear class N95 masks (series No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical workers should wear a protective coat suited to the figure to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a N95 class mask; possibly the virus entered his body through inflamed eyes.
Therefore, medical workers should also wear transparent face shields or closed-type protective glasses.
All populations in affected or potentially endangered regions are strongly advised to wash their hands more often than usual with disinfectant detergents, try not to leave the house, observe self-isolation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
The acceptable distance to the patient is considered to be about a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was previously unknown to mankind, its high degree of resemblance to SARS-CoV, on January 7, 2020, was supposed to be an alarming signal for China, given the experience it acquired during the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, only after January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control reassured citizens that the new virus has a low contagion rate and limited reproductive capacity when transmitted from person to person and that preventing and controlling the spread of the disease will not be a problem.
This statement greatly reduced social tensions, especially during a time when the whole country was preparing to celebrate the Chinese New Year, and missed a critical time when the disease could be contained within Wuhan with minimal losses.
China’s health authorities can learn this tough lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, as every word is taken into account by citizens and can affect their attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information coming from clinics rather than wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more decisive measures to curb a potential epidemic in its early stages rather than reassure the public; and (4) conduct more targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and regular monitoring and improving the response system of society.
The outbreak of COVID-19, caused by a previously unstudied severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease spread throughout China and spread to 50 countries.
Because the virus is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the outbreak of COVID-19 has a feeling of recurrence of SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are significant in terms of epidemic deterrence and patient treatment.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; the proportion of severe cases and mortality among older people is also higher than among young people.
Mortality from SARS is higher than in COVID-19 (10,91% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even with an asymptomatic course of the disease, while patients with SARS usually infect others only in severe cases of the disease, so curbing the spread of COVID-19 is harder than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and more extensively than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have a negative normal test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
On the other hand, healed patients may again show positive tests for the virus.
This significantly increases the risk of spreading the virus.
Against the backdrop of such rapid advancement in COVID-19 research, some key issues remain unresolved, namely:
What is the origin of SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of a 96 percent homologue between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like flying mouse coronavirus, we can still not argue that SARS-CoV-2 infection originated from flying mice.
Which animal became the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, such as flying mice, to humans?
Without the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot reliably interrupt the path of transmission, and the epidemiological situation can worsen at any time.
Molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly is the virus introduced into respiratory tract cells and provokes subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-producing cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot guarantee a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve in the process of transmission from human to human?
Will it cause a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or recur periodically like the flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but, whatever it costs, to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to a normal life.
The Zoonotic Origin of Human Coronavirus
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoV) and their carriers, including humans, over millennia.
Before 2003, it was known that two human coronaviruses (HCoV) cause a mild disease, such as a common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our understanding of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in central China at the end of 2019 has once again drawn attention to coronaviruses and surprised us with the high transmission, but less pronounced pathogenicity of this virus compared to its relative SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis, and understanding its zoonotic origin will be very helpful.
Most human coronaviruses originate from flying mice for which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate carriers of some human coronaviruses are also known.
The definition of carrier animals directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
Studying the interactions of animals that are carriers of the coronavirus may also shed light on the pathogenesis of the coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we present available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their detection, as well as their zoonotic origin and ways of species-to-species transmission.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic of the disease caused by the coronavirus discovered in 2019 (COVID-19) is also considered.
In addition, the conditions necessary for the successful change of carriers are noted, and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the course of the disease.
Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive-polar RNA thread.
These viruses with the largest among RNA-containing viruses genome, holding from 26 to 32 thousand nucleotides, got their name because of their shape, which when considered under an electronic microscope resembles a crown.
In terms of structure, coronaviruses contain unsegmented genomes with identical organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are transmitted to the polyprotein replicates pp1a and pp1ab.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, designated nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains open reading frames for structured proteins, including shell-like protein (S), shell protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
In other coronavirus lines, a number of line-specific accessory proteins are also encoded.
Based on differences in protein sequences, coronaviruses are divided into four types (alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronaviruses), while the type of beta coronavirus includes most human coronaviruses and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha and beta coronaviruses are flying mice and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma and delta coronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have consistently overcome inter-species barriers, and some have evolved into dangerous pathogens for humans.
So far, seven human coronaviruses are known.
These include human alpha coronavirus HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The other five beta-coronaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe infectious diseases of the lower respiratory tract in a comparatively greater number of patients with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory disease (ARD) and manifestation of extrapulmonary symptoms.
The first thread of human coronavirus HCoV-229E, B814, was obtained from a sample separated from the nasopharynx of cold patients in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has gained more detailed knowledge about the HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses that cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, before the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that human coronavirus infection was generally considered harmless.
The 2003 outbreak of SARS was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history; more than 8,000 people were infected, and the overall mortality rate was about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a prolonged epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease sporadically spreading to the rest of the world.
Discovered in 2019, the new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed to SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current coronavirus infection epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which as of March 3, 2020 has killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people.
An alarm signal has been received, and the world must prepare for the upcoming pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven human coronaviruses are of zoonotic origin, their sources are flying mice, mice or domestic animals.
Numerous datasets indicate the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronaviruses from flying mice, to whose organisms the viruses have adapted well and in which they do not exhibit pathogenic properties but demonstrate wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic posed a severe medical, scientific, social and moral challenge to China and the world.
The study of the zoonotic mechanism of the origin of human coronaviruses will enable us to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution, and the factors limiting interspecies transmission.
It may also suggest or speed up the search for a reservoir, an intermediate and amplifying carrier of SARS-CoV-2, which is very important to prevent the disease from spreading again in the future.
This review contains general information on the zoonotic origin, interspecie transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we identify and consider the following general feature: the original viruses from which human coronavirus originated are usually not pathogenic to their reservoir carriers, but acquire pathogenic character after interspecular transmission to a new carrier.
We are also analyzing the evolutionary trend of human coronaviruses, according to which increased transmissibility is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.
In the same context, the outcome of the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is considered.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HCoV-229E was first derived from a nasopharyngeal sample of cold patients, various coronaviruses were found in different infected animals, including indes, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronaviruses have been identified in recent decades.
Table 1 provides a brief history of human coronavirus detection in chronological order.
The first strain of the HCoV-229E virus was obtained from samples taken from the respiratory tract of patients with infectious lesions of the upper respiratory tract in 1966; later this virus was adapted to reproduce in the lines of lung cells WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, general nausea and sore throat, with fever and cough in 10 to 20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was isolated from organ culture and subsequently passed into the brains of mammals.
Clinical signs of HCoV-OC43 infection look similar to the manifestations of HCoV-229E infection, the symptoms of which are indistinguishable from the lesions of other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza type A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both the HCoV-229E virus and the HCoV-OC43 virus are widespread worldwide and are generally transmitted during winter in moderate latitudes.
Basically, the incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by an approximately two-week illness.
According to a study of volunteers, healthy people infected with the HCoV-229E virus developed a mild common cold.
Only a few patients with weakened immunity showed severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The outbreak of SARS, also known as the “epidemic of atypical pneumonia”, was the first well-documented pandemic in human history caused by the human coronavirus, and the cause of the disease was SARS-CoV, the third identified human coronavirus.
The first case of SARS was detected in late 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdong.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread across many countries and continents.
Without taking into account the hyperactive distributors, it was estimated that each infected person could infect about two more people; the incubation period was from 4 to 7 days, and the peak of the viral load fell on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experienced muscle pain, headaches, high fever, general nausea and frigidity, and subsequent symptoms included shortness of breath, cough and respiratory failure.
Common deviations of laboratory indicators from the norm in SARS are lymphopenia, disorders in liver samples and elevated levels of creatinine kinase.
Patients with SARS also experience diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and an increase in macrophages.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently need intensive therapy and mechanical ventilation of the lungs.
In such severe cases, other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, can also be infected in addition to the lower respiratory tract, which is usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be fatal, especially for patients with weakened immunity.
For the first time, the virus was isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the patient who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been focused on human coronavirus research.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
Initially it was found that it mainly affects younger children, elderly people and patients with weakened immunity and respiratory diseases.
For the disease caused by HCoV-NL63, such manifestations as rhinitis, conjunctivitis, high fever and bronchiolitis are characteristic.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal material taken from an 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was discovered in the Netherlands, but it is actually widespread.
According to estimates, HCoV-NL63 is the cause of approximately 4.7% of widespread respiratory diseases, with the peak of diseases caused by it occurring in the early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, which is also called croup.
HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in Hong Kong the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to outpatient pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with an exacerbation of asthmatic diseases.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 virus, causing mild respiratory diseases, has been detected worldwide.
All four human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections have adapted well to humans, and their mutation leading to highly pathogenic diseases is generally unlikely, although incidents have been and their causes are unknown, as in a rare case with a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, has caused a serious lower respiratory tract infection in China.
Typically, by gaining the ability to effectively transmit and persist in the human body, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic.
The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure.
Most of the laboratory-confirmed cases occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia there have been recorded cases of transportation and spread through episodic secondary cases of close contact infection.
Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
Clinical manifestations of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) resemble symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) - both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by human-transmitted coronaviruses.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome with a high mortality rate (34.4%) have been recorded, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses known to humans.
From mid to late December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia were identified in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, which now, looking back, is associated with an infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization has announced that the ongoing outbreak of the lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself has been called "coronavirus infection 19" (COVID-19).
As of March 3, 2020, 90.053 confirmed cases were recorded worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.4%.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in the Chinese province of Hubei is 4.2%, and beyond it - 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2, like the coronavirus SARS and MERS, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly move into acute respiratory failure syndrome.
Despite the similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses, however, form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has a greater transmission capacity compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 have been recorded, indicating the ability of this virus to spread rapidly around the world.
Comparing and comparing SARS-CoV-2 with six other human coronaviruses reveals important similarities and differences.
First, human-transmitted coronaviruses have a similar incubation period and duration of the disease they cause.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four human coronaviruses causing outpatient infections (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are similar to those most commonly observed with human coronavirus infection that causes outpatient infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms or even absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 can be identified, although the ratio here is slightly lower.
Third, in terms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, there are also interesting patterns characteristic of both human coronavirus causing out-of-hospital infections and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses causing out-of-hospital infections.
On the other hand, it remains to be checked whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases with each subsequent transition of the virus (i.e. infection of each subsequent person), as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause outpatient infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
We still have to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral transmission pathway of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least under certain circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
Particularly interesting is the question of the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, characteristic of human coronaviruses causing extra-hospital infections.
However, the future development of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 will depend on the features of SARS-CoV-2, including transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after transition through humans.
All four human coronaviruses that cause outpatient infections with mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
On the other hand, these people have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both of them could be called the only survivors of human coronavirus pandemics in the past.
Human coronaviruses causing severe diseases in humans, and people whose human coronaviruses cause severe diseases, simply did not survive.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate in the human body to a sufficient extent to accumulate adaptive mutations that counteract carrier restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the chance that the virus will fully adapt to the human.
If it adapts well, its transmission among humans will be difficult to stop by quarantine or other measures to control infectious diseases.
For many years, there have been four out-of-hospital coronaviruses circulating among the population, causing common cold in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
The highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well enough, and their transmission among humans cannot be sustained.
They need to survive and reproduce in their zoonotic reservoirs and look for cases of hitting susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate or amplifying carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four outpatient HCoV viruses.
It is very easily transmitted as an out-of-hospital HCoV, at least now.
But it is more pathogenic than out-of-hospital HCoV, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it fully adapts to humans and will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate carrier animal.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, intermediate, amplifying and reservoir carriers of HCoV viruses.
An animal serves as an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it carries a closely related ancestor with the same high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this carrier.
Similarly, the tank carrier continuously carries HCoV for a long time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV was only taken into the intermediate carrier just before or around the time it was taken to a human, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an amplifying carrier, allowing the virus to flashfully replicate and then pass it on to people, increasing the scale of human infection.
HCoV can carry a stumbling infection if it cannot withstand transmission within the intermediate carrier.
On the contrary, HCoV viruses can also adapt to an intermediate carrier and even establish prolonged endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate medium becomes a natural reservoir carrier.
Epidemiological data showed retrospectively that a zero-patient with SARS had a history of contact with hunting and fishing animals.
Further studies of seroprevalence have shown that animal traffickers have a higher prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV than the general population.
Himalayan caterpillars (Paguma larvata) and enotous dogs on live animal markets became the first established carriers of SARS-CoV-like and almost identical viruses.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that after the destruction of all civilisations on the markets, no more cases of SARS were.
At the same time, it was that in Himalayan cylinders living in the wild or on farms that did not reach the markets, SARS-CoV was not detected in most cases, suggesting that Himalayan cylinders could only serve as an intermediate booster carrier rather than a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that since 80% of the different animals on the Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it cannot be ruled out that numerous species of small mammals may also serve as intermediate enhancer carriers.
All of them appear to be impasse carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.
A subsequent search for the natural carrier animal SARS-CoV revealed a closely related CoV of flying mice, which has been called the atypical pneumonia-related coronavirus of subconvex flying mice HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and which is present in Chinese subconvex flying mice.
These mice are positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other coronaviruses of flying mice have 88–92% of the same homology of nucleotide sequences as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that flying mice became carriers of new human pathogens.
In flying mice, several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been detected, but none of them, except one that marks WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
The SARS-CoV receptor is known to be human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It has been shown that WIV1, obtained from a sample of the feces of flying mice, uses ACE2 of flying mice, cvets and humans as a receptor for entering the cell.
Interestingly, serums of recovering patients with SARS were able to neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest relative ancestor of SARS-CoV in flying mice, sharing 95% of the homology of nucleotides.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus of SARS-CoV, and flying mice are not the direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV.
Philogenetic analysis attributes MERS-CoV to the same group as CoV-HKU4 flying mice, and CoV-HKU5 flying mice.
CoV-HKU4 flying mice and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptil-dipeptidase-4 (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.
The sequence of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the MERS-CoV virus is phylogenetically closer to the sequence of the beta-coronavirus of flying mice identified in Europe and Africa.
Until now, no live MERS-CoV virus has been found in wild flying mice.
The homologies of the nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 of flying mice coincide only by 87%.
That is, flying mice may not be the direct reservoir carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.
Studies in the Middle East, on the other hand, have shown that unicorn camels are seropositive to MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, as do camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, has been isolated from the nasal patches of unicorn camels, further confirming the role of camels as true reservoir carriers of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that the camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV had minor symptoms but massive virus release.
It is noteworthy that infected camels secreted the virus not only by breathing, but also by fecal-oral means, which is also the main way of isolating the virus in flying mice.
However, there are still questions as many confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome did not have a history of contact with camels before symptoms occurred and are credibly related to human-to-human transmission or unknown channels involving unidentified animal species that are MERS-CoV carriers.
The homology of the nucleotide SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% identical to the CoV of the RaTG13 flying mice isolated in the Asian subconvex Rhinolophus affinis.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute to them parental relationships.
That is, flying mice could not be a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2, unless near-identical flying mice coronavirus will be found in the future.
The immediate carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are believed to be among the wild species sold and killed on the Wuhan seafood wholesale market, which has linked many initial cases of COVID-19, indicating a likely case of transmission from animal to human.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as manis javanica may also be carrying the parent beta coronavirus, a related strain of SARS-CoV-2.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of these new pangolin coronavirus genomes coincides 85-92% with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with an identity at the level of nucleotide sequences of about 90%.
They are clustered into two sublines of virus differentiation, similar to SARS-CoV-2, in the phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RSD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
On the contrary, the RSD of the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 strains are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.
An earlier study of pangolin patients also determination of viral contagion in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used other assembly and manual processing methods to obtain a genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-size viral genome.
It cannot be ruled out that pantholin has become one of the intermediate animals carrier of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-related beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2-associated pancolin beta coronavirus.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in flying mice, pantholines and other mammals has not yet been established.
While the highest homology of sequences was found in RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and pancolin-related beta coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 had the highest homology of sequences within the entire genome.
Very theoretically, the high degree of similarity between pangolin beta coronaviruses, related to SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2, is associated with parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal advocates a recombination between the pangolin beta coronavirus, a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, and RaTG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among beta coronaviruses.
A definitive decision on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been made.
In addition to the highly pathogenic viruses HCoV, the zoonotic origin of the viruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 is also studied.
Philogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may originate from flying mouse coronavirus, while parent viruses of the strains HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been detected in rodents.
The flying mouse coronavirus, named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and detected in the North American three-colour squirrel, has been to demonstrate close affinity with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically linked to another flying mouse coronavirus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that its intermediate carrier could also be camels.
For clarity, current knowledge about the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and in Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence of events of interspecular transmission of HCoV in the history.
When HCoV-OC43 transmitted between species around 1890 and humans became infected by pets, a pandemic of respiratory infections was.
The history of the intermodal transmission HCoV-229E is not so clear.
The alpha coronavirus of flying mice, closely related to HCoV-229E, has been detected.
Among them is the alpha coronavirus.
Some data supports the direct transmission of the virus from flying mice to humans.
First, it was humans, not alpacos, who could have been in contact with flying mice in a common ecological niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the alpaca.
Second, the alpha coronavirus of flying mice, related to HCoV-229E, in flying mice is varied and non-pathogenic, while the alpha coronavirus of alpaca caused an attack of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha coronavirus alpaca was not detected in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be ruled out that alpacae may have received the alpha coronavirus, a relative to HCoV-229E, from humans.
In fact, flying mice are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that flying mice could directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while alpha coronaviruses in flying mice could serve as the genetic pool for the HCoV-229E virus, alpacos and unicorn camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of the MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV serves as a perfect example of interspecies transmission from flying mice to unicorn camels and from unicorn camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from flying mice is known by its initial identification and was subsequently confirmed by subsequent studies.
Obviously, flying mice provide a rich pool of viral varieties for genetic fragments exchange and species-to-species transmission.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and the ability to fly make flying mice “ideal distributors.”
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced by a unicorn camel a decade ago.
It has adapted well to these camels, which have turned from an intermediate carrier to a stable and natural reservoir carrier.
In these animals, MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease and is characterized by a relatively low frequency of mutations.
Its episodic transmission to humans is accidental, and the person remains an impasse carrier of MERS-CoV, as its transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pantholins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, pangolin beta coronavirus is highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be stumbling carriers of beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as cysts in the case of SARS-CoV.
Further research will need to confirm or rule out several possibilities of interspecie transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First, flying mice can be a reservoir carrier for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
People can share an ecological niche with flying mice due to coal mining or cutting the carcasses of these animals.
Second, pantholines may be one of the intermediate enhancing carriers in which the related SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently entered.
People are infected with the virus through cutting carcasses and eating meat from wild animals.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Examination of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is justified.
Third, as stated above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in the third form, which contacted both flying mice and pandolines.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to different types of carrier animals, three main factors from viruses have also contributed to the crossing of interspecies barriers.
First of all, their relatively high rate of mutations in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, the estimated incidence of coronavirus mutations can be considered "moderately high" with an average rate of replacement of approximately 10–4 replacements per year at one site 2 depending on the coronavirus' adaptation phase to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have corrective exorbonuclease, the removal of which leads to an extremely high frequency of mutation and weakening or even non-viability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue of Remdesivir inhibits the replication of coronaviruses due to the inhibition of this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising remedies against SARS-CoV-2, which needs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is almost a million times higher than their carriers.
In addition, the frequency of mutation can often be even higher if the coronavirus is not adapted well enough to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high frequency of mutation, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutations is apparently lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is believed that this virus has already adapted to another carrier close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to unicorn camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that vaccines and antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 will quickly lose their effectiveness as a result of genetic drift.
Second, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses leads to greater plasticity in genomic modification in relation to mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the likelihood of interspecular co-evolution favorable to the emergence of new coronaviruses in the presence of appropriate conditions.
This is facilitated by numerous unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded in the direction of the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, due to the unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and frequently switch matrix during RNA replication.
During the transcription of coronavirus DNA in the carrier, which serves as a mixing vessel, there is often a switching of threads.
High-homological full-size and subgenomic RNAs can recombine and create new coronaviruses.
Philogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, and in animal coronaviruses such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 of flying mice.
Virus-carrier interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors listed above, another key factor important for inter-species transmission is the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor.
This article cites SARS-CoV recombination as a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis between human and cellular SARS-CoV strains, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different carriers, with regard to S-protein RSD mutations.
In general, the RSD of the coronavirus’s S-protein interacts with the cell receptor, and the carrier’s antibody response intensely selects it.
The RSD in SARS-CoV is an amino acid, from 318th to 510th, on the S1 fragment, which binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (APF2) and its coreceptors to introduce the virus into the cell.
The SARS-CoV RSD is able to recognize the ACF2 receptors of different animals, including flying mice, mice, mice, and enotous dogs, making it possible to transmit the virus between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found in the RSD, which differ from human viral strains, and 4 of them are in a receptor-binding motif for interaction with the APF2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV cyst has mutations K479N and S487T in the RSD, which may increase the affinity of the cyst protein interaction with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be especially important for the virus’s adaptation to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein segment leads to the fact that the binding affinity of the S protein to human ACF2 could have changed.
Indeed, a study using a cryoelectron microscope says that the affinity of this connection is 10 to 20 times higher than between a human APF2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other correspondents are needed for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to APF2, but to another segment of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as N-aminopeptidase for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsiac acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after species-to-species transmission from carrier animals.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecular transmission of HCoV is also controlled by other factors of dependence and carrier limitation.
The divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural reservoir carriers of HCoVs, such as flying mice, unicorn camels and rodents, may constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
For successful interspecular transmission of HCoV viruses, dependence factors must be usurped and carrier restriction factors subordinated.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important field of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categorized.
Good results can be given by impartial full-genome screening of dependence factors and carrier restriction for SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology.
The emergence of new HCoVs: back to zero
The variety of coronaviruses of flying mice creates wide opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, flying mouse coronavirus serves as a genetic pool for HCoV.
Furthermore, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving forces of HCoV evolution and serve as two important stages in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new genes encoding proteins has the potential for radical modification of viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is considered important for adaptation to humans, as flying mouse viruses, related to SARS-CoV, have been isolated, but it has been found that they code the divergence proteins of ORF8.
In strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of the SARS-CoV coronavirus was detected.
This deletion breaks down ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates the shift of carriers.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha and gamma coronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination localizations have also been determined in nsp9 non-structural proteins, most nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV was subjected to recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in unicorn camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCoVs in which HCoVs were recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection may contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, which are most likely due to the elimination of the virus from the selective pressures exerted, for example, by the carrier's immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of full-size ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E due to double-nucleotide deletion.
While the intact open reading frame of ORF4 can be observed in flying mouse and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpha coronavirus alpha shows a mononucleotide insert that leads to a frame shift.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also due to the pressure of selection on their tank carriers.
When flying mice were infected with coronaviruses, mild symptoms or their absence were recorded, suggesting mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and flying mice.
It turned out that flying mice are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, defects in activation of the pro-inflammatory response in flying mice effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
Furthermore, the natural killer cell activity in flying mice was suppressed by aprilation of the inhibitor receptor of the natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and a low level of molecular expression of the main class I histocompatibility complex.
Moreover, the high level of active forms of oxygen, which is provided by the high metabolic activity of flying mice, can suppress the replication of the coronavirus, while affecting the reading of exorbonuclease, thus creating a selection pressure for the generation of virus strains, which when penetrated into the new carrier are highly pathogenic.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains may also evolve as a result of recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties for carrier adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have appeared in the last twenty years.
Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their tank carriers, such as flying mice or camels.
They replicate confidently without causing a strong immune response in the carrier.
This is the secret of why we see asymptomatic carriers, and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly associated with hyperactivation of the immune response and a cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe lung damage.
On the contrary, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is not associated with coronavirus replication.
The same strategy of non-binding the immune response may have beneficial effects in therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
Flying mice have a strong interferon response.
Thus, taking interferon type I, at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should have a beneficial effect.
In addition, in flying mice, the activation of the NLRP3-inflammatory massom is disrupted.
Based on this, inhibition of NLRP3-inflammatory massomasome with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general scheme according to which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV occurred.
While the beta-coronavirus of flying mice, whose nucleotide homology is 95% identical with SARS-CoV, has been found, there is also a coronavirus of flying mice whose nucleotide homology is 96% identical with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that cattle and other animals on the market carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, direct intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 have not been established.
Pancolin beta coronaviruses, surprisingly homogeneous to SARS-CoV-2, have been detected, suggesting that pancolins may have served as an intermediate carrier, or that fragments of pancolin beta coronavirus genes may have entered the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by humans.
Coronaviruses have attracted public attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in flying mice and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoirs of HCoV in human transmission.
Convincing evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from flying mice and have been transmitted to humans through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and civilians on markets, closing wildlife markets and destroying civilians on them could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in light of the discovery of various lines of pangolin beta coronavirus, closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolin should be removed to prevent zoonotic transmission of the infection from food markets.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pantholins and other mammals and how it can happen remains a matter of future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed in unicorn camels.
These camels serve as an important vehicle as well as the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as it was done in China’s wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop periodic outbreaks of MERS, an integrated approach is needed to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels in combination with other measures of infection control.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear that cause outbreaks of the disease.
There are many zoonotic coronaviruses circulating around the world.
In particular, coronaviruses of flying mice with zoonotic potential are extremely diverse.
There are enormous opportunities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonotic coronaviruses, which in the future will lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more easily transmitted and/or more deadly to humans.
To reduce the amount of excessive contact between humans and animals, we should abandon the culture of eating wild animals in some areas of China.
After severe tests such as SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plans are needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until the possibility of capturing new territories arises.
Although many properties of flying mice are conducive to the spread of viruses, if you teach people to stay away from them, you can minimize the likelihood of human contact with flying mice and other species of wild animals.
A better understanding of the environment of coronaviruses and their natural carriers requires constant mammalian epidemiological surveillance, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of coronaviruses from animals to humans and future outbreaks of disease.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the environmental niches of natural zoonotic virus reservoirs.
The puzzle of zoonotic origin SARS-CoV-2 still lacks some fragments.
First, if flying mice have transmitted the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pandolines, it is interesting to see under what circumstances flying mice and pandolines share the same ecological niche.
Second, if flying mice play a more direct role in the transmission to humans, then it is necessary to determine how humans came into contact with flying mice.
Third, if the role of a true intermediate carrier is played by a third mammal, then it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, flying mice and pandolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it’s a flying mouse, pantholin or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its precursors are expected to be identified in their natural carriers in the future.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updated diagnostic criteria for “suspected cases” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a 2019 Short Reference Guide to the Diagnosis and Treatment of a New Coronavirus Infection (2019-nCoV), which outlines our experience and provides proven guidelines on how to deal with this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has gradually increased based on current research results and clinical experience; thus the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we answered one comment on our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for “suspected cases” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the “COVID-19 Diagnostic and Therapeutic Recommendations” (Seventh Edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the outbreak of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially named coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the viral disease itself was named "heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2" (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a brief reference guide and published it online on the website of the journal Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This publication attracted great attention.
COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has been gradually increasing based on current research results and clinical experience; thus the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
For example, between January 16 and March 3, 2020, seven editions of the “COVID-19 Diagnostic and Therapeutic Recommendations” published by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) were published, with the content of some of its provisions substantially changed.
Recently, in the work prepared by Zhou with co-authors, comments were given about our recommendations.They contained simple diagnostic suggestions based on existing clinical experience.
This work added new practical evidence to our recommendations and provided valuable reference information on this worldwide pandemic.
We reaffirm the high importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest issue of the "Diagnostic and Therapeutic Recommendations for COVID-19" (trial seventh version) and the results of current research, and their work needs to be updated.
According to the seventh edition of this document (from 3 March 2020) for comprehensive analysis in confirming the case of suspicion of the disease, it is necessary to combine any one element of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of movements or stays in Wuhan and its surroundings or other settlements where cases of COVID-19 were within 14 days before symptoms appeared; (2) history of contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with high fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its surroundings or from other settlements where cases of COVID-19 were within the last 14 days before symptoms appeared; (4) history of contact with groups of people with confirmed diseases (≥ 2 cases of high fever or respiratory symptoms recorded within 2 weeks in small areas such as a home or apartment, office, school, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) the presence of external manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of leukocytes is normal or decreased with reduced number of lymphocytes at the early stage of symptoms.
Diagnosis for a confirmed case of the disease should be based on a case of suspicion of the disease with one of the following pathogenetic or serological evidence, namely: (1) real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full-genome virus sequencing shows high homogeneity with respect to new coronaviruses; (3) positive serotest results for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG antibodies; or change in test result from negative to positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies, or increase in titer by at least 4 times in the recovery phase relative to the corresponding indicator in the acute phase.
It can also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions of this document, a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added.
Pathogenetic blood sample diagnosis was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then the need for serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers looking for the optimal set for the detection of nucleic acids in rapid diagnosis, as well as for the analysis of samples taken from the respiratory tract, including blood samples, which increases the availability of various samples and facilitates the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the disease confirmation criteria.
However, there is increasing evidence of the need for caution in the treatment of patients with atypical symptoms and patients without severe symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in Zhou et al. needs to be updated as it classifies individuals without clinical symptoms as a “low-risk” group.
The assessment system also requires clarification in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we hope to obtain more direct evidence and urge readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “suspected cases” and “confirmed cases”, we encourage readers to monitor and strictly follow the latest recommendations given in the countries in which they live.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19 – daily maximum
Bangladesh has confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths per day.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus per day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) that the number of infections included 114 current cases, as well as 33 recovering patients who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths were.
In an online briefing, IEDCR Director Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said four men and one woman were killed.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two of the dead were aged over 60, two were aged 51 to 60 and one was aged 41 to 50.
She also that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a COVID-19 pandemic.
An employee of the clinic told local news agency Anatola that one of the dead was Jalal Sayfur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at the Kuwaiti Matri Clinic.
In an online video statement on Saturday, Bangladesh’s Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaydull Kwader, said public transport will be shut down for a longer period than originally planned, until next Saturday.
The work of public transport was stopped from March 26 and was to resume on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods — medicines, fuel and food — was still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 were in Bangladesh on March 8 in two people who returned from Italy, as well as in the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, these three people have already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has reached 1 million cases worldwide
According to the Johns Hopkins University, on Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infection SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceeded one million.
Coronavirus COVID-19 has killed at least 52,000 people.
The boundary came on the same day that the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi and the first case of death from the coronavirus was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries in which no cases of coronavirus infection were recorded.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization 1,051 635 confirmed cases of infection, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours preceding 10:00 CET (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that more than 1,000 deaths caused by the coronavirus infection were recorded in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced tougher measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin extended the regime of self-isolation of citizens of the city until May 1.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russians across the country, despite self-isolation, will receive wages until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days; the results of the vote: 215 votes for, ten abstained and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the command hour in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, while previously the command hour lasted only from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to introduce a command hour from 10 p.m. to 4 p.m.
Ohio Governor Mike Dewey has announced that the regime of domestic isolation in the state has been extended by an order until May 1.
Australian stores limit the number of toilet paper packs that can be purchased at a time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian retail chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of packages of toilet paper that can be purchased at once in all the country’s stores to two and one packages, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a limit on one package.
These restrictions were in ads at the casinos, as well as on the Facebook page of the network.
Citizens have begun making emergency reserves due to fears that COVID-19 could lead to the introduction of a regime of general self-isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Earlier, March 4 and 5, respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited this amount to 4 packs.
Coles said in a press release on March 8 that with the introduction of the four-pack restriction, “many stores are still buying out toilet paper too quickly – one delivery in an hour” and called this demand “unprecedented,” while ALDI in a Facebook post posted on Tuesday called this trend “unexpected.”
According to a spokesman for Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also limited this amount to two packages.
To fill the shortage, Coles began ordering larger batches from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional batches, while ALDI made stocks for a special early-sale promotion on Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers are trying to replenish stocks, but this is difficult due to local authorities’ restrictions on truck schedules.
It expects the cost of products to rise as suppliers try to meet demand, but there are fewer and fewer advantageous offers available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some stores could not hold promotions on Wednesdays due to stock exhaustion.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said stores are replenishing stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky commodity, so the amount of warehouses is small, and after the sale of the entire volume of goods, the long rows of shelves remain empty, increasing the feeling of a shortage of stocks.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if shelves could be filled, and goods like toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectants could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, buyers probably’t get so panicked,” says Russell Zimmerman.
On Wednesday, the recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives a Crap that stockpiles were running out.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the toilet paper manufacturer Kleenex and Solaris Paper, which also manufactures Sorbent branded goods, said they were working around the clock to provide enough goods.
Domain.com, a real estate selling site, that when the number of auctions in Melbourne dropped due to a shortage of buyers on Labour Day holiday week, some real estate sellers began offering free toilet paper to the first auction participants.
The Thursday issue of the Darwin-printed daily NT News included an eight-page tab intended for cutting and using as toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia’s March 3 report, stores initially reluctantly imposed restrictions on the quantity of goods they purchased, stating they didn’t plan to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in increased demand, including medical masks, hand disinfectants, gallantheria, handwashers and flour.
Similarly, in addition to events in Australia, on Sunday evening it was noticed that the UK supermarket Ocado online store also limited the sale of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 reels.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of the infectious disease COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the fact that the term “pandemia” only characterizes the scale of the disease, and not the danger of specific cases, the WHO notes that governments need to take action:
“All countries together are still able to influence the course of the pandemic.”
This is possible if countries engage in detecting, testing, treating, isolating patients, tracking cases, and mobilizing their citizens,” said Tedros Adanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of spread and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inactivity.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is “unprecedented.”
He said in an interview broadcast on CNN in February that “no other respiratory virus other than the flu has been tracked since its onset until its continuous global spread.”
Mr. Ghebreyesus expressed a similar point of view, saying that “we have never seen a pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
“We have never seen a pandemic before that can be controlled.”
First, in January, the WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance, and then granted it a new status – a pandemic.
Director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauchi, said: “This is just the beginning, it will be worse.”
According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were worldwide on Thursday, with more than 4,600 people dying.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is the current coronavirus disease pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and a public health emergency of international importance was declared on January 30, 2020, which was subsequently declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Approximately 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is 4%, while in the world it ranges from 13,04% in Algeria to 0,08% in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive.Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping a distance between people, identifying and ensuring self-isolation of people suspected of their infection.
Authorities around the world have responded to the situation by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, command hours, risk control at workplaces and closures of various facilities.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic consequences, the postponement or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages of goods aggravated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities were closed nationally or regionally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of students worldwide.
There have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other citizens of East and Southeast Asia, or people who resemble them externally, as well as against other groups of people living in areas where there are significant cases of spread of the virus.
As a result of the reduction in the number of trips and the closure of heavy industries, the level of air pollution and carbon emissions has decreased.
On December 31, 2019, the health authorities of the city of Wuhan (the capital of the province of Hubei), China, cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and an investigation of the situation was launched in early January 2020.
Cases of infection were mainly linked to the wholesale market of Huanang seafood, so the virus is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a newly discovered virus that has great similarities to the flying mouse coronavirus, pancolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first case of the disease occurred on December 1, 2019, and the infected person did not visit the market after that date.
Two-thirds of the infections in December 2019 were related to this market.
On March 13, 2020, a publication by the South China branch of the Morning Post, the information of which has not been verified, suggested that the first case of infection occurred with a 55-year-old inhabitant of the province of Hubei on November 17, 2019.
The number of cases of the disease can be significantly underestimated, in particular, due to many cases with mild symptoms.
As of February 26, relatively few cases of infection were among young people, with patients aged 19 years and under accounting for less than 2.4% of cases worldwide. Chief Scientific Advisor of the United Kingdom Patrick Wallace estimated that 60% of the British population will be infected until effective group immunity is formed among the population of the country.
The statistics include cases of infection of people who were tested for COVID-19 and whose test was positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has been able to test more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, have adopted an official policy that requires not to test if they show only minor symptoms.
The study, published on March 16, found that 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected in China before January 23, and that such unregistered patients were the source of infection for 79% of cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 showed that the number of cases of actual infection in Italy significantly exceeded the number of cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproductive infection number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
In a study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is estimated that this figure could be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 recover safely.
In other, more difficult cases, the time from the onset of symptoms to the moment of death was between 6 and 41 days, the most common period was 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were associated with COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age, and 75% of deaths had concomitant diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official COVID-19 pandemic deaths data usually include deaths of patients with positive COVID test results, performed according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not take into account the deaths of people who have not been tested – for example, in the case of deaths at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Incomplete data for Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID figures by four to five times.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges: “We know [the death toll] is below the actual.” His words are confirmed by reports of some isolated cases in the U.S. A similar record with incomplete data is often found in pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed deaths were recorded in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first deaths outside mainland China were recorded on February 1 in the Philippines and outside Asia in France on February 14.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths were recorded outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and regions on all continents, except Antarctica, deaths.
All indicators vary depending on the region and time of disease spread; they are also influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment schemes used, the time since the outbreak and population parameters, such as age, gender and general health status.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 10, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6% (97 039/1 617 204).
The data for different regions vary.
In China, the rate of mortality to morbidity decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include determining the disease mortality rate (CFR) — the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from the disease, and the infection mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die from the disease.
These statistics are not tied to a specific time and reflect the indicators of certain population groups from the moment of infection to the completion of the course of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators for specific groups of people.
According to the Center for Evidence Medicine at the University of Oxford, the mortality rate from this pandemic overall ranges from 0.1 to 0.39%.
The top figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first arbitrary COVID-19 test in Germany, as well as with the statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR scores.
The WHO says the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and exact duration of the outbreak cannot be determined and may vary depending on the location.
Macey Boni, an associate at the University of Pennsylvania, argues that “uncontrolled outbreaks of infections tend to reach the plateau, and then, when the number of available disease carriers expires, they begin to extinguish.
However, in the current situation, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen.”
Chinese government senior medical adviser Zhong Nanjing said that “everything could end by June” if all countries were able to mobilize and implement WHO’s recommendations to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 “will circulate, possibly, within a year or two.”
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the leadership of Neil Ferguson, “until a vaccine is created (possibly 18 months or more)”, physical distancing and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, an associate at Vanderbilt University, said: “I don’t think this coronavirus will ever disappear forever because it’s so easily transmitted,” and that it “could turn into a seasonal disease, outbreaking every year.”
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively non-specific, and some infected people can bear the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum formation in the respiratory tract (slime), loss of odor, shortness of breath, pain in the muscles and joints, sore throat, headache, numbness, vomiting, hemorrhage, diarrhea or cyanosis.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists such urgent symptoms as difficulty breathing, constant pain or feeling pressed in the chest, sudden feeling of confusion, difficulty waking up and bleaching of the face or lips. In the presence of these symptoms, you should immediately seek medical attention. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
In some infected people, the disease can be asymptomatic, without any clinical manifestations, but the results of tests confirm the fact of infection, so doctors recommend placing people in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed under strict control and examined for infection.
According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of the asymptomatic course of the disease ranges from a few units to 44% of all cases.
The usual incubation period (time between infection and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; usually it is five days.There is no complete clarity on the symptom of odor loss: according to initial estimates, the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed this symptom was initially 30%, and then dropped to 15%.
Some details about the ways of spreading the disease are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small drops released into the air along with coughing, sneezing or during conversation; close contact means contact in a radius of 1 to 2 meters (from 3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, open cough drops can spread from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
There are assumptions that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops thrown into the air during conversation, which can stay in the air for longer.
Drops can get into the mouth or nose of people nearby, as well as into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and thus to the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, followed by touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through feces, but the risk of this method of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious within the first three days after symptoms appear, although its spread can occur both before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease.
There have been cases where tests were positive when tested three days before symptoms appeared, and this suggests the possibility of transmission of the virus before symptoms were pronounced.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed cases of asymptomatic disease, but contact tracking studies in some countries have also identified cases of disease transmission from asymptomatic carriers.
Workers at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) say that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one patient usually infects 2–3 other people.
In particular, it was found that on plastic surfaces (polypropylene) and stainless steel (304) the virus can live up to three days, on cardboard surfaces - for one day, and on copper surfaces - up to 4 hours.
These data, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature. Domestic and other animals have received a positive result on COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, just like, for example, after contact with other surfaces that could have been touched by infected people.
Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first detected in three people with pneumonia from the group with acute respiratory disease registered in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature in related coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed by using household soap, which dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 has great similarity to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, a subgenus of Sarbecovirus (cell line B) together with two other strains of flying mouse viruses.
At the holistic genome level, it is 96% identical to other samples of the flying mouse coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the genome sequences of the pandoline virus and humans.
The overall genomic comparison to date has shown that the highest percentage of similarity (92%) is between the coronavirus pantholin and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pantholins are intermediate hosts of the virus.
Virus infection can be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although ultimately this should be confirmed by polymerasic reverse transcription chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of the infected secretion or computer tomography.
The results of the study, which compared the PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan, showed that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonia and disease processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a first-line testing method in COVID-19 diagnosis.”
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, and the first of them was published on January 17.
Testing for real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is carried out.
It can be done on respiratory samples and blood samples.
Results are usually ready within a period of several hours to several days.
Normally, a nasopharyngeal lubrication is used for the test, although a lubrication may also be used.A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them was accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, the serological test developed by Cellex was approved for use in emergencies only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of the visualization of symptoms on X-rays and computer tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral turbidity by the type of matte glass and the absence of pleural outputs.
The international database of confirmed cases of infection is compiled by the Italian Radiological Society.
Due to similarity with other infections, such as adenovirus, when identifying COVID-19 images not confirmed by PCR tests have limited clinical specificity.
A large study in China compared CT scans and PCR tests and found that while images are less specific in the case of infection, they can be deciphered faster; moreover, they are more sensitive, and therefore this diagnostic method can be considered as a screening tool in infected areas.
For the diagnosis of the virus using X-rays and computer tomography, coagulative neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease includeining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, using coughing or sneezing towels, which should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may already have been infected should wear a medical mask in crowded places.
In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended to be physically distant from people.Many governments advise to refrain from any unnecessary trips to countries and areas affected by the outbreak, and restrict the movement of citizens.
However, the virus has spread to most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading among the population, some members of which do not know where and how they were infected. Medical professionals caring for patients who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions as well as precautions when contacting other people and eye protection. Contact tracking is also an important method used by health authorities to determine the source of the infection and prevent its further spread.
Governments’ use of citizens’ location data via their mobile phones for this purpose has raised confidentiality concerns, and organizations such as Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued statements calling for restrictions on this type of human surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been developed and offered for voluntary use; as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on developing solutions that ensure the confidentiality of personal data — for example, logging a user’s proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user has been in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test was positive, he receives a notification.There are also unfounded versions about how to prevent infection — such as rinse the nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.
Currently, there is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working on its creation.
To prevent the spread of the disease, it is recommended to wash your hands.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends washing your hands more frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or with severe hand contamination, as well as before eating, after squeezing, coughing or sneezing.
This is necessary because, being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective shell.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using alcohol-based hand treatment disinfectants with an alcohol content of at least 60%.
The WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a number of solutions (on the surface of stainless steel disinfectant begins to act a minute after application) with a content of 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7,5% povidon iodine.
Other components, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that in case of suspicion of COVID or its confirmation in an institution such as an office or day hospital, all spaces of such premises, including cabinets, toilets, common areas, electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick people, be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend when coughing or sneezing to cover the mouth and nose with the rear side of the elbow or a towel and immediately throw away used hygiene items.
Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks, as the use of the mask can limit the volume and range of distribution of exhalation products that are dispersed in the air when talking, sneezing and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “Using a medical mask can reduce people’s tendency to touch their faces, and touching their faces with dirty hands is the main way to infect.”
The WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that the use of the mask actually reduces the number of touches to the face.
Several countries have begun calling for the use of medical masks in public places.
The CDC Centers, USA, recommend wearing non-medical tissue facial masks.China has separately emphasized the importance of using single-use medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transportation or in crowded places.
Health officials in Thailand urge people to make facial tissue masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from going out without masks covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, the Vietnamese government called on all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered all visitors to food stores to wear medical masks.
The Israeli government also called on citizens to wear masks in public places.
On April 1, Taiwan, where ten million medical masks have been produced every day since mid-March, ordered all passengers on trains and inter-city buses to wear medical masks.
In Panama, residents are obliged to wear medical masks when they go out; those residents who cannot buy masks were advised to sew them themselves at home.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is a measure to combat infection aimed at slowing down the spread of disease by minimizing close contacts between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centers.
People can use social distancing measures by staying at home, limiting trips, avoiding crowded places, using contactless greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments in regions, especially those severely affected by the outbreak, are currently prescribing or recommending social distancing.
The maximum number of people that can be gathered in one place according to the recommendations of U.S. government agencies and health organizations has been quickly reduced, from 250 (in regions where there was no data on the spread of COVID-19) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned gathering in groups comprising more than two people. Elderly people and people suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and weakened immune systems face an increased risk of getting the virus in a serious form. The CDC recommends that they stay at home as long as possible if there is an outbreak in the region. At the end of March 2020, the WHO and other health authorities began to replace the use of the term “social distancing” with “physical distancing”, thus clarifying the goal of this measure – to reduce physical contact within social connections, whether through virtual communication or with physical distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" was understood in such a way that people should expose themselves to complete social isolation instead of staying in contact with other people in alternative ways.Some departments have published guidelines on sexual health to be used during a pandemic.
Among other things, recommendations have been given to have sex only with your regular partners with whom you live and who you are sure does not have the virus and its symptoms.
Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they are infected are advised to isolate themselves at home.
Health institutions have issued detailed instructions on proper self-isolation, and governments in many countries have also mandated or recommended that all populations in the affected areas put themselves in quarantine on their own.
Persons in high-risk groups were prescribed the strictest quarantine.
Individuals who may have been in contact with COVID-19 infected persons or have recently visited a country or region heavily affected by the epidemic were advised to be in quarantine within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Strategies to combat the outbreak include curbing the spread of the disease, suppressing it, or mitigating it.
Controlling the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage and aims to track and isolate infected persons, as well as other measures of infectious control and vaccination in order to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At a stage when it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts are directed to mitigate the consequences: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the healthcare system and society.
Measures to deter and mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease may be taken simultaneously.
Suppression of infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the base number of infections to a level below 1.
Such efforts reduce the risk of health care overload and give more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help deal with the outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, use of medical masks and self-isolation; public measures aimed at physical distancing, such as shutting down schools and canceling mass events; engaging the community to facilitate and participate in such measures; and environmental protection measures such as cleaning surfaces.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantines have been introduced, as well as the operation of an alert system on the movements of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to infected individuals in self-isolation and imposed large fines on those who did not.
Taiwan increased the production of medical masks and fined for the accumulation of excess medicines. UK and U.S. modeling showed that there are serious problems with regards to mitigation (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (stopping the growth of the epidemic).
An optimal policy to mitigate the spread of disease could reduce the peak burden on the healthcare system by 2/3 and mortality by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapse of healthcare systems.
Suppression may be the preferred method, but it must be used as long as the virus circulates among the population (or until a vaccine is developed if it happens earlier) because otherwise the spread of the disease will quickly resume when measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic leads to social and economic costs.
Antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of COVID-19 currently do not exist, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking enough fluids and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid administration and respiratory support.
The use of steroid drugs can only harm.
Several compounds that have previously been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also being considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also that some “traditional and home remedies” could relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The WHO considers capacity-building and healthcare adaptation to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as the primary measure to respond to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO European Regional Bureau have issued guidelines for primary care clinics and services to facilitate resource redistribution at multiple levels, including concentrating laboratory services on testing for COVID-19, eliminating out-of-course procedures where possible, detecting the virus and isolating patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, and enhancing intensive care capabilities through staff training and increasing the number of available IVL devices and beds.
There are various theories about where the first case of infection may have occurred - the so-called "zero patient".
The first known case of a new coronavirus infection probably occurred on December 1, 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of cases of coronavirus infection in the province of Hubei has gradually increased.
They were mainly linked to the wholesale market of Huanang seafood, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus penetrated into the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. on December 26, a case of a mass disease of pneumonia of unknown origin was registered at the Hubei Province Clinic, with which Zhang Tianjin, a doctor who worked on the case, the case on December 27 to the Jiangshan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the city of Wuhan.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the central clinic in the city of Wuhan warned their colleagues of a “SARS-like coronavirus.”
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenlian, were warned by the police of responsibility for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ai Feng, received excuses from her superiors for raising panic.
Later, on December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice and informed the WHO about the situation.
The Wuhan health authorities the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which turned out to be large enough to initiate an investigation in early January.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, facilitated by the Chinese New Year holidays and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation and major railway hub.
On January 20, China 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to later official data, by January 20, 2020, the symptoms of the disease had already appeared in 6,174 people. As of March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy for the largest number of confirmed infections in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million infections were recorded worldwide, more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have at least one case of infection.
Because of the pandemic, many European countries of the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National response measures included measures to curb the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory home stay, compulsory home shelter or isolation), as well as a commanding hour. As of April 2, about 300 million people, or about 90% of the population of the United States, were in any form of quarantine, more than 50 million people are in isolation in the Philippines, about 59 million people are in isolation in South Africa and 1.3 billion people in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of isolation, and two days later this figure increased to 2.6 billion people — about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was recorded in Wuhan on December 1, 2019; according to another report, the accuracy of which has not been verified, this date is November 17.
On December 26, Dr. Zhang Jianyang worked with a case of a massive illness of an unknown type of pneumonia, which was by her clinic to the Jiangshan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the city of Wuhan on December 27.
The primary genetic testing of samples of patients, which took place on December 27, 2019, showed the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a corresponding public notice.
WHO was notified the same day.
In connection with such notifications, the police warned doctors in Wuhan of responsibility for “sparing rumors” about the outbreak.
Initially, the Chinese National Health Commission claimed that there was no “clear evidence” that the newly discovered virus could be transmitted from person to person.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to curb the spread of the virus, which was later called “people’s war” by Chinese Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping.
The events of the "most-scale quarantine in human history" began to unfold, the sanitary cordon and the ban on entry to Wuhan and back on January 23 was announced, later this measure spread to a total of 15 cities in the province of Hubei and affected a total of about 57 million people.

On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang said that the spread of cases of the disease transmitted inside the country had largely been stopped and the outbreak in China had been taken under control.
On the same day, travel restrictions to Hubei, with the exception of Wuhan, were lifted, two months after the province was closed for quarantine. On March 26, 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that entry for persons with a visa or residence permit will be suspended from March 28.

It was confirmed that COVID-19 spread to South Korea on January 20, 2020 from China.
On February 20, the National Ministry of Health a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases of the disease, largely due to the large number of followers of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Xinchongji gathered in Tagu.

As of February 22, 1,261 (approximately 13%) of 9,336 church followers having symptoms of the disease.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases of infection were in Korea, and on February 29, this figure has risen to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were placed in quarantine after tests confirmed the presence of the virus in three soldiers.
The outbreak affected the number of trips, therefore the airline flight schedules were changed. South Korea has deployed a population screening program for the presence of the virus, tracking contacts and organizing quarantine measures for contact persons. This program is considered the largest and best in terms of its organization worldwide.
The screening methods included compulsory notification of their symptoms through a mobile app by all who came from abroad, a full-fledged test for the virus, the results of which were ready the next day, and the expansion of testing capabilities, which allowed to test up to 20,000 people daily.

The WHO praised the Chinese authorities' efforts to combat the epidemic and curb the spread of the infection.
The WHO noted clear differences between the outbreak of atypical pneumonia in 2002-2004, during which the Chinese authorities were accused of classifying information, allegedly preventing the disease and curbing its spread, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central government “regularly provided up-to-date information about the situation to avoid panic on the eve of the Chinese New Year.”
On January 23, in response to the central authorities’ decision to ban transportation in Wuhan, WHO spokesman Godin Galea noted that while “this measure was definitely not recommended by the WHO” it was also “a very important confirmation of the commitment to curb the epidemic at the most prevalent place” and called it “unprecedented in the history of public health.”30 January, after confirming the ability of the infection to be transmitted from person to person outside of China and the increase in the number of infected in other countries, the WHO declared an emergency in the public health system of international importance (PHEIC); this situation became the sixth since 2009, when such measure was first applied during the pandemic of swine flu.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adanom said the announcement of the PHEIC is due to the “risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries that do not have reliable health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr Tedros said that “there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily hinder international movements and trade,” and that “the WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement.”
On February 5, the World Health Organization (WHO) called on the global community to allocate $675 million to provide strategic readiness to the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting the need for urgent assistance to those countries that “do not have systems to detect people infected with the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries.”
Mr Tedros also stated that “the indicator of our readiness is the degree of readiness for the epidemic of our weakest link,” and called on the international community to “make a choice: invest today or pay in the future.”
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General António Guterres agreed to provide “the potential of the entire UN system in response to the problem.”
As a result, the United Nations Crisis Management Group was created to coordinate all United Nations response measures, which, according to the WHO, will allow “the focus on health response while other departments can use their expertise to tackle the outbreak on a wider social and economic scale.”
On February 14, the WHO and China initiated the creation of a joint special group that provided international experts and WHO staff in China to help settle the domestic situation and assess “the seriousness and contagion of the disease”, organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as visits to assess “the effectiveness of response measures at the provincial and district level, including urban and rural areas.”
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, the WHO sent a joint team there to assess the situation.February 28, WHO officials said the probability of the global spread of the coronavirus would be increased from “high” to “very high” – the highest level of alert and risk.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergency Program, warned in a statement: “It’s a test of every government on the planet for preparedness for the real situation: it’s time to act.
This virus may already be on its way to your country, and you need to be prepared,” he said, adding that the right response could help the world avoid the “worst scenario.”
Ryan also said that the current data does not serve as a basis for public health officials to declare a global pandemic, and added that the proclamation of a pandemic would mean that “we essentially recognize the fact that every person on the planet will be at risk of getting infected with this virus.”
On March 11, the WHO declared the outbreak of the coronavirus a pandemic.
The WHO Director-General said that the WHO “is deeply concerned by both the alarmingly high spread and severity of the disease and the no less alarming level of inaction in relation to the problem.”WHO is severely criticized for its considered inadequate approach to the concept of a pandemic, including the later declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
As a negative response to the current situation, a petition was submitted to WHO Director-General Tedros Adanoma with a request to resign, which was signed by 733,000 people as of April 6.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts highlighted the importance of respecting the rights of every person during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone has the right to apply to him/her life-saving measures, and the responsibility for organizing such measures is the government.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or medical insurance should in no way justify discrimination against any particular group of people.
Everyone has the right to health protection, including people with disabilities, representatives of minority groups, elderly citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless people, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other undetermined groups in need of state support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has created a platform designed to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to gather opinions and provide recommendations.
The digital node contains information about country policy measures (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the global economy, eliminate the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote coordinated global coronavirus response.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove and Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for taking action to combat the pandemic that began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of provincial-level leaders of the Communist Party of China (CCP) have been dismissed for the quarantine measures they have taken in central China, and these dismissals showed dissatisfaction with the political establishment’s response to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe the move was aimed at protecting Chinese Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Liqiang, disagreed with a previous statement that the coronavirus outbreak started in Wuhan, but took the side of the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in the U.S. or Italy.
U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has called the coronavirus “a Chinese virus” or “a Wuhan virus,” saying that “Censorship in China only worsenes the situation with the virus, which has now turned into a global pandemic,” and that statement has in turn been criticized by some commentators who argue that such an approach is racist and “distracts the U.S. presidential administration’s inability to curb the spread of the disease.”
The Daily Beast has gained access to a US government telegram containing a communication strategic trick, apparently invented by the National Security Council, with the following strategic references: “It’s all about China.
We are asked to disseminate this information by any means possible, including press conferences and television speeches." Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg said China's efforts to help countries affected by the virus are part of a "propaganda pressure" to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Joseph Borrell warned of the presence of “a geopolitical component that includes the struggle for influence through the PIA and the so-called policy of generosity.”
Borrell also said that “China is persistently promoting its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States.”
China also urged the United States to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while, according to some reports, sending aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned due to U.S. sanctions imposed on April 3.
The US authorities are also accused of redirecting aid to other countries to their own country.
Regarding medical masks, disputes have also arisen between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has assigned hundreds of IVLs intended for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of support from the European Union for Italy affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the EU, said that “only China has reacted bilaterally.
This is not a sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin organized the sending to Italy of Russian military sanitarians, specialized disinfectant transport and other medical equipment.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80% of the Russian aid was "unhelpful or little useful for Italy."
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favorable impression on the global public at a “geopolitical and diplomatic” level.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected the media attacks and expressed their gratitude for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “By offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase production rates, they will also be able to provide response assistance if necessary.”
NATO’s Defender 2020 military exercises, scheduled in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries – the largest NATO military exercises since the end of the Cold War – will be held in a shortened format.
Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 (Defender 2020) exercise: “In the public health crisis that has emerged today, conducting these exercises threatens the lives of not only the U.S. military and many European participating countries, but also the residents of countries where such events should be held.”
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in an open letter called on world leaders to help, reporting that his country was struggling to fight the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets due to U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran.The epidemic sparked calls for the United States to adopt social policies widespread in other wealthy countries, including the implementation of a unified health and child care system, paid family leave and increased public health funding.
Political scientists anticipated that this could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of being re-elected in the 2020 presidential election.
South Korea has criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine measures" after Japan announced that any citizen arriving from South Korea would be placed in two-week quarantine in specially designated government locations.
South Korean society was initially divided by President Moon Jae-in’s reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president’s actions or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for the government’s inadequate response to the outbreak.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this move will allow governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, parliament voted to grant Prime Minister Viktor Orbán indefinitely the right to rule by decrees, suspend parliament, hold elections and punish those accused of spreading false information about the virus and government measures to fight the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been named the cause of several cases of supply shortages due to the global growth in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the panic shopping of goods and disruptions in production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about a shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and failures in suppliers.
Panic purchases also occurred in several settlements; this led to a situation where the shelves of the shops disappeared essential goods such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, which in turn led to a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry is warning about delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This leap led to a twenty-fold increase in prices compared to normal prices, as well as delays in delivery of medical products for four to six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and the WHO has warned that healthcare workers will be hit for this reason.
In Australia, in connection with the pandemic, buyers under the Daigo system got a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
This activity led to a shortage of baby food in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food, acute food shortages were avoided in both areas.
The successful measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation of stocks and the illicit trade in critical products have avoided the acute food shortage that was expected in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, whose agricultural production is small, has not experienced significant declines, but, according to industry representatives, prices for agricultural products can rise.
Shelves of grocery stores remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pork stocks to provide adequate food for the population.
Similar laws requiring food producers to preserve food supplies in case of emergencies exist in Italy.
The damage to the global economy has affected China: According to media data from March 16, China’s economy has been severely affected in the first two months of 2020 due to government-taken anti-virus measures, which resulted in a 20.5 percent decline in retail sales.
Mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing center; therefore, the outbreak is believed to pose a serious destabilizing threat to the global economy.
According to Agatha Demaraj, an Economist Intelligence Unit employee, volatility in the markets will persist until a clearer picture of the potential results appears.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the current epidemic in terms of global growth could outweigh the consequences of the epidemic of atypical pneumonia of 2002-2004.
According to an estimate by an expert from Washington University in St. Louis, the damage to the global supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) isly taking “urgent measures” following a sharp drop in oil prices due to falling demand from China.
On February 24, global stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones index for industrial companies, showed the most sharp drop since 2008, with the Dow index falling by 1,191 points, the largest one-day drop since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed a drop of more than 10 percent.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, but retained a negative outlook.
The stock again fell due to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus, with the biggest drop occurring on March 16.
Many believe there is a possibility of a recession.
Economist Mohammed El-Erian has highlighted the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and governments.
Central banks are responding faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by travel bans, closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations not to travel.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines canceled flights due to a sharp decline in demand for air tickets, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional airline Flybe ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise industry has been stronger than ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chongqing, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year celebrations.
National and regional governments have cancelled a number of large-scale events, including the annual New Year’s Festivals; private companies have also independently shut down their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai’s Disneyland.
Many New Year's events were cancelled, and tourist attractions were closed to prevent mass crowds; for example, the Forbidden City was closed in Beijing and traditional temple fairs were cancelled.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and districts, authorities extended the New Year’s holidays until February 10, instructing most not to open before that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of its exports.
The Hong Kong authorities raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest and declared a state of emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling the New Year celebration.
Visits to retail points in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retail in North America and the Middle East cut sales by 50-60%.
As a result, in March, shopping centres visibility fell by 33-43% compared to February.
The operators of shopping centers around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improving sanitation, installing equipment to check the temperature of visitors and canceling events.According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a pandemic-induced recession in Latin America could leave 14–22 million more people beyond the poverty line than it would be in a similar situation, but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of the 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers found themselves at home in their country’s provinces or locked up in Hubei Province.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, a coronavirus outbreak in the United States could deprive 47 million people of jobs and unemployment rate could reach 32%. The self-isolation measures introduced in India will leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers unemployed receiving daily pay. A study conducted by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have somehow faced unemployment. Nearly 900,000 Spanish workers have also lost jobs since the introduction of strict isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a single social benefit.
The German part-time pay scheme was also introduced in France and the UK.
The spheres of art and cultural heritage have also been heavily affected by a pandemic that has affected the activities of organizations, as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, around the world.
Cultural and art organizations have sought to support their (often state-funded) mission of providing access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their employees and the public, and, where possible, supporting the people of art.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions were closed worldwide indefinitely, or access to them was restricted to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events and performances were cancelled or postponed to other dates.
In return, active efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and growing effect of the spread of the virus is the cancellation of religious services, major sports events and other public events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican has announced the cancellation of the events of the Great Week in Rome, which are held on the last week of the Christian repentance period - fasting.
Many dioceses recommend that elderly Christians stay at home and do not attend Sunday services; in some churches, church services have begun to be broadcast on radio, live or television, while some church leaders offer open-air services.
The Roman Catholic diocese of Rome closed its churches, chapels and St. Peter's Square, where Christian pilgrims no longer appear, and later other religious organizations also canceled worship and restricted access to public worship in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gourdwares.
Iran's Ministry of Health has announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak of the coronavirus, and the shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia has banned the access of foreign pilgrims and its own residents to the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic led to the most significant change in the calendar of world sports events since World War II.
Most major sports events have been cancelled or postponed, including UEFA Champions League 2019-20, UEFA Premier League 2019-20, UEFA Euro 2020, NBA 2019-20 and NHL 2019-20 season.
The coronavirus outbreak also destroyed plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to begin at the end of July; on March 24, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be “delayed to the period after 2020, but not later than the summer of 2021”.
This has led to many players switching to online mode, and many gambling sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers. The entertainment industry has also suffered as various music groups suspended or canceled concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as the Broadway, also canceled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline events, some artists and musicians have been exploring ways to continue their activities and share their results over the Internet, organizing live streams of online concerts or web festivals; this helps people of creative professions continue to perform, produce or publish their works.
There have been many internet memes on the coronavirus topic, many of which are humorous and smooth out the anxiety that is typical for periods of uncertainty.
Since the introduction of COVID-19, there has been an exacerbation of prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards Chinese citizens and people of East Asian origin, as well as to representatives of hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Cases of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
The February report (when most cases of infection were still confined to China) recorded racist attitudes expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received fair compensation for anything.
In some African countries, anti-Chinese sentiment has also risen.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Chinese citizens, as well as those living in the affected areas, were supported both offline and online.
The epidemic began to spread to new countries, notably Italy, the first country in Europe to face a serious outbreak of COVID-19; in this regard, citizens of such regions may also begin to feel the influence of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea signed a petition at an early stage, insisting on banning Chinese citizens from entering their countries in order to curb the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan (#ChineseDo Not VisitJapan) took the leading positions on Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States, report rising levels of racist sentiment and even attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a “Chinese virus”; critics consider it racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses that carried to New Sanjar Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Wuhan.
Students coming from northeastern India bordering China and studying in major cities in India have cases of persecution associated with the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the State Division of the Bharatia Janata Party, West Bengal, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and “therefore God avenged them.”
Later, these statements were condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, calling them "misleading."In China, because of the pandemic, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents again erupted: foreigners began to be called "foreign garbage" and objects subject to "disposal".
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made public their scientific papers on the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to their research results on preprint publication servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing of respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods to detect the antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by OT-PCR, which recognizes the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is intended only to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm sufficiently recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and for population control purposes.
Tests for antibodies reveal the number of people who have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too minor to be taken to the hospital, or were absent at all.
The exact rate of mortality from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing capabilities, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
By March 23, no country was able to test more than 3% of its population, and the information about the number of tests carried out in different countries is very controversial.
Probably, such differences in information significantly affect recorded mortality rates, which in some countries may be significantly exaggerated.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be carried out on respiratory tract samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal lubrication or a sputum sample.
Results are usually available within a period of several hours to 2 days.
The OTC-PCR test performed on the smears taken from the throat is valid only for the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can disappear from the throat, yet continue to multiply in the lungs.
In infected patients tested in the second week of the disease, as an alternative, material from the lower respiratory tract can be taken using an absorption catheter, or expectorant products (sputum) can be used.
One of the early PCR tests was developed at the Charite Clinic in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis of 250,000 sets subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 28, 2020, South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a kit to detect SARS-CoV-2 based on clinical level PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It identifies the “E” gene, common to all beta-coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene, specific to SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group has become one of the first companies to obtain permission from China’s National Drug Administration for the emergency use of the SARS-CoV-2 PCR-based detection kit. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributing their real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel through International Reagent Resource to public health laboratories (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel).
One in three genetic tests from older versions of the test kits yielded incomplete results due to faulty reagents and the narrow testing area conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed on average throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that date were state and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Quality Supervision Authority as part of an emergency license for use. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 infection based on RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostics will start testing for COVID-19 nationwide from March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been stated; sampling and processing of analyses must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology "Vector".
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Supervision Service. It was that on March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for the use of the test, which can be conducted for 3.5 hours on a large sample volume, allowing a single machine to process approximately 4128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency license (EUA) to Abbott Labs for testing the Abbott m2000 system; previously, the FDA issued similar licenses to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid will also receive the EUA from the FDA for a 45-minute test.
The FDA has also approved a test that uses isothermic nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of cycles of alternating temperatures, this method can reveal positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 such machines in the U.S., and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day.Taiwan is currently developing a test using a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) of the new coronavirus, and there is hope to get results in 15-20 minutes, similar to an express flu test.
A March 2020 review of the literature concludes that “Chest X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computer tomography] results may have such value even before symptoms appear.”
Typical signs detected during CT include bilateral multi-fold subpleural sealing focuses of the type of "matte glass" with peripheral, asymmetric and aposteric distribution.
Subpleural domination, symptom and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
The results of the study, which compared PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan at the time of the current pandemic, showed that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation “do not use CT for screening or as a first-line test method in the diagnosis of COVID-19”.
Partially, the immune response to infection is expressed in the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity, and for population control purposes.
In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to be performed by high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the production speed of each such system.
CLT typically uses a single sample of peripheral blood, although serial samples can also be used to track the immune response.
With PoCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by piercing the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, a blood sampling stage is not required to take a sample test.On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have passed all the necessary registration procedures and can now spread their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA approved only one emergency approval test.At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals to use their test kits, which can detect in blood samples IgG and IgA antibodies that have the ability to fight the virus.
Test performance is several hundred samples over a few hours, and therefore this method works much faster than conventional PCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection.In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody tests it purchased gave satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients with suspicion of the virus to stay at home: "emergency department employees give the patient a sample tube," the patient spit in it, gives back and after a while receives the test results. The British NHS has announced the launch of its pilot scheme to test suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk of infection by other patients visiting the clinic, or the need to disinfect the ambulance if it was used to transport the patient. During the express test on COVID-19 in suspicious cases, the medical worker takes the analysis using all appropriate precautions.
Express testing centers have helped South Korea organize one of the fastest and most comprehensive testing procedures in any other country. on March 2, Germany’s National Association of Compulsory Medical Insurance Physicians said it was prepared to conduct about 12,000 tests a day in outpatient conditions, while a week earlier they could only do 10,700 tests a week.
If the examination is prescribed by a doctor, then the costs are covered by medical insurance.
According to Robert Koch, the president of the Institute, Germany’s total test performance is 160,000 tests a week.
As of March 19, it was proposed to conduct express tests in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests passed in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that as of calendar week 12/2020 on SARS-CoV-2 a total of at least 483 295 tests were taken, up to week 12/2020, inclusive, and for 33 491 samples (6.9%) the result was positive. Researchers from the Israeli clinics Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for simultaneously testing samples taken from 64 patients by combining samples and conducting further tests only if the combined sample shows a positive result. In Wuhan on February 5, 2020, BGI opened a temporary 2000 square meter area emergency detection laboratory called “Hu-Yang” (Pokita 火眼 or “Fire Eye”), which can process more than 10,000 samples a day.
The construction of this laboratory was organized by BGI founder Van Jiang and completed in just 5 days; simulations showed that if this laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated rate, cases of disease in Hubei would be 47% more, and consequently, the cost of quarantine would also be twice as high.
After the opening of the laboratory in Wuhan, Huoyang laboratories were immediately opened in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai - in total in 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, the daily total bandwidth rate was 50,000 tests per day. Open multiplex Origami Assays have been released, which can test up to 1,122 patient tests for COVID19 using only 93 probes.Such balanced designs can work in small laboratories, excluding the need to use robotic fluid manipulators.
By March, due to the shortage and insufficient number of reagents, it became problematic to conduct mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US.
As a result, some authors turned to test sample processing protocols that provide for samples heating at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes in order to release RNA genomes for further testing. on March 31, it was announced that the volume of coronavirus testing carried out by the United Arab Emirates per capita currently exceeds that of any other country, and soon most of the population will be tested.
This was due to the ability to conduct express testing, along with the acquisition of the Group 42 and BGI mass population testing laboratory (created on the basis of their Huoyang emergency detection laboratories in China).
The laboratory, deployed in 14 days, is capable of performing tens of thousands of CT-PCR tests a day and is the world’s first large-scale laboratory operating outside of China.
Different testing options targeting different parts of the coronavirus’ genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of the manufacturing of test kits that are sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Sanitary and Epidemiological Centers was unavailable until January 28, leading to a lack of test kits in the U.S. At the very beginning of the outbreak, there were problems with the reliability of test kits in China and the U.S., and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide enough kits recommended by health experts.
But in South Korea, experts say, the wide availability of testing has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the South Korean government has been working to provide facilities for testing, mostly in private laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for more testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.As a result of the growing demand for testing caused by the rapid spread of the virus, many private U.S. laboratories, which received hundreds of thousands of test samples, were overloaded, and the reserves of materials for the sampling and chemical reagents were rapidly exhausted.
In March 2020, China problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The American test kits developed by CDC had "defects" and for this reason the government removed the bureaucratic barriers that hindered private testing development. Spain acquired the test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of using these kits were inaccurate.
The company explained that the cause of inaccuracy of the results may be a failed sampling or improper use of kits.
The Spanish ministry said it would recall sets that gave inaccurate results and replace them with other sets – sets from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of test kits that the Czech Republic acquired in China gave incorrect results. 1.2 million test kits purchased by Slovakia in China were also found inaccurate.
Atesh Kara, an employee of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, claimed that the test kits purchased in China had a “high level of error” and the Ministry “did not start using them.”
Quarantine measures for individuals whose tests gave a positive result for SARS-CoV-2, as well as monitoring people with whom such patients were in contact, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where a person died from COVID-19 for the first time in Italy, conducted two cycles of testing of the entire population of about 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of those with a positive outcome had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases of the disease were placed in quarantine.
Entrance to the territory of the settlement was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.
In the context of intense contact tracking, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 in Singapore was much less tense than in other developed countries, and there did not have to impose such extreme restrictions as forced closure of restaurants and shops.
Many events were cancelled there, and on March 28, Singapore began urging residents to stay at home, but schools, the holidays ended on March 23, opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, also managed to cope with the pandemic through intensive contact tracking, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but restrictions in them were less aggressive.
The statistical study found that in countries where more tests were carried out compared to the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because these countries managed to identify more patients with mild symptoms or absence of symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries without resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 test results to one of WHO’s 16 control laboratories for confirmation testing.
Seven of these 16 control laboratories are located in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
In the following chart, the percentage of positive results column depends on the testing policy adopted in a particular country.
A country where only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher percentage of positive results compared to a country where all citizens are tested, regardless of the presence of symptoms of the virus, on other equal terms.
Hand washing, also known as “hand hygiene”, is the process of cleaning hands to remove contaminants, fat, microorganisms or other harmful substances.
Regular handwashing with soap at certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted via the fecal-oral route.
A person can also get infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or a common cold, for example, if he touches his eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes) with unwashed hands.
There are five critical moments during the day after which you should wash your hands with soap: before and after defecation, after washing the baby’s buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before eating, as well as before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ashes.The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after the treatment of a sick person.
After changing diapers or washing the child going to the toilet.
After swallowing, coughing or sneezing.
After contact with animals, feed or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygienic actions associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before taking medicines or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to clean hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease), as well as chemicals that can be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is especially important for people who are engaged in cooking or working in the medical field, but it is also important for all other people.
Hand washing is very beneficial for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious types of diarrhea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections.
It also reduces infant mortality at home.
A 2013 study found that better hand washing can lead to a slight acceleration in growth in children under the age of five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhea diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits such as washing hands with soap.
This basic procedure can reduce mortality from these diseases by almost 50%.
Regular reminders about the benefits of hand washing can reduce the number of cases of diarrhea by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of providing low-income regions with clean water.
Washing hands with soap is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases (ARDs) provided that appropriate habits are developed in every home, school and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main complications of ORIs, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, killing approximately 1.8 million children a year.
Approximately 3.5 million children die from diarrhea and pneumonia each year.
The United Nations Children’s Fund reports that washing hands with soap before meals and after the toilet, which has become a tough habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce diarrhea mortality by almost half, and mortality from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitary activities carried out as part of water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Handwashing also prevents the occurrence of impetigo, a disease that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A small negative effect of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to drying of the skin and, consequently, to its damage.
A 2012 Danish study found that too frequent hand washing can lead to itching and peeling of the skin – a disease known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is common among healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing can also be considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal-oral transmission: after emptying (urine, defecation), after washing the baby’s buttocks (change of diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.
Some other cases where hands should be washed to prevent disease transmission: before or after treatment of a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or squeezing, after contact with animal waste or animals, after contact with garbage.
In many countries, the procedure of washing hands with soap is relatively uncommon.
A hand-washing study conducted in 2015 in 54 countries found that on average 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap is a common practice. A 2014 study found that the highest rate, 97%, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the U.S. in this list is closer to the middle, their rate is 77%; the lowest rate was recorded in China – 23%. Currently there are several methodologies for changing behavior and developing the habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations.
The Emergency Health Care Program, implemented by the Philippine Ministry of Education, is an example of large-scale measures to promote children’s health and education.
The basis of this national program is dehelmintication, which is carried out twice a year, as well as daily hand washing with soap and daily dental cleaning with fluoride.
The same program is successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin occurs more effectively if soap or detergents are added during the washing process.
The main action of soap and detergents is to eliminate barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water itself is not considered an effective remedy for skin cleansing, as fats and proteins, which are components of organic pollution, are poorly dissolved in water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the cleansing process.
Hard soap, due to its repeated use, may also contain bacteria that can get on it when used previously.
A small number of studies on getting on the skin of bacteria from a contaminated piece of solid soap suggests that there is little likelihood of such an impact, as the bacteria are washed off with foam.
The CCS still claims that “liquid soap with a manual dispenser is the preferred option for hand washing.”
Antibacterial soap is actively promoted in communities that care about their health.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selective to antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not match the advertised.
In addition to the surface-active substance and skin protection, complex compounds may contain acids (acetic, ascorbic, dairy) as a pH regulator, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other fragrances (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that in terms of preventing disease and removing bacteria from the skin of the hands, simple soaps are as effective as conventional antibacterial soap containing triclosan.
Hot water at a comfortable temperature for the human skin is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at a body temperature of 37°C.
However, for removing natural fats that retain pollution and bacteria, warm soap water is more effective than cold.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water does not reduce the microbial load on the hands.
Hand disinfectant (sanitizer) or hand antiseptic is a product for hand hygiene that does not contain water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based hand hygiene products that do not contain water (also known as alcohol-based hand disinfectants, antiseptics for hand disinfection or sanitizers) became increasingly popular.
Most of these products are made on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of thickeners, such as a carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of a gel, or moisturizers, such as glycerin in liquid or foam form, providing convenience of use of these agents and reducing the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity.Desinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis sticks, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, flu and hepatitis) and fungi.
70% alcohol-containing disinfectants kill 99.97% of bacteria (a reduction rate of 3.5, similar to a reduction of 35 decibels) on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% of bacteria (a reduction rate of 4-5) on the hands 1 minute after application.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are virtually ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of antiseptic or alcohol-containing agent must be used to carefully treat and impregnate the skin of the hands on both sides.
The face and rear surface of both palms, as well as the space between the fingers along the entire length, are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is fully absorbed.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends choosing to wash your hands rather than using disinfectants, especially if your hands are heavily contaminated.
The growth in popularity of such disinfectants is due to the ease of their use and the rapid destruction of microorganisms, but they should not serve as a substitute for fully washing hands, if there is a possibility to use water and soap.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants can cause dry skin if they do not contain softeners and/or moisturizers.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and (or) other softening substances to the product.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand disinfectants containing softening components caused significantly less irritation and dry skin than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants almost do not occur.
The lower likelihood of irritating contact dermatitis has become a factor in favor of choosing disinfectants compared to soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, products that do not contain water do not clean hands of organic substances, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms as regular soap and water, because when using such agents, pathogenic microorganisms still remain on your hands.
The effectiveness of a hand disinfectant that does not contain alcohol depends largely on the components and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcohol-containing products.
Recently, it has been shown that drugs that use benzalkonium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity unlike alcohol, which has been shown to lose efficacy after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin side effects.
Many people in low-income communities can’t afford soap and replace it with ashes or clay.
Ash or clay may be more effective than water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One of the problems with this method is that if clay or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, it can, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
If soap is not available, the WHO recommends using ashes or sand as an alternative.
To prevent infection, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommend the use of hand washing techniques, including the following steps:
Wash your hands under warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended, because standing water can be contaminated, but the temperature of the water does not matter.
Wash your hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the rear side of your palms, as well as the areas between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes microbes from the skin, and studies show that when using soap (not just water) people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.
Shake your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Friction helps remove microbes from the skin, and the longer you rub your hands, the more microbes are removed.
Wash your hands thoroughly under running water.
Washing hands in standing water can cause re-infection.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel or let them dry off on their own.
Wet and wet hands are more easily contaminated.Most often people neglect areas such as the thumb, wrist, areas between fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail lacks can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use a moisturizing lotion to prevent drying of the skin of the hands, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of getting an infection.
If running water and soap are not available, there are many different inexpensive ways to wash your hands: spilling water out of a hanging canister or bottled pumpkin with holes made and/or using ashes if necessary, such as in developing countries. In places with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions such as pedal cranes and other inexpensive options.
The foot pedal crane is a simple design consisting of a container hanging on a rope and a foot lever that should be pressed to pour water into the hands; at the same time, a piece of soap should be used.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but there are some controversies about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing volume of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, a study conducted by the University of Westminster in London sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper Wipes and Towels compared the level of hygiene of paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and more modern flow air dryers for hands.
It was found that after washing and drying hands in a dryer with warm air, the total number of bacteria on the fingers increases by an average of 194%, and on the palms - by 254%.
It was also found that after washing and drying hands in the air-flowing dryer, the total number of bacteria on the fingers increased by 42%, and on the palms - by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the fingers drops to an average of 76% and on the palms to 77%.The researchers also conducted tests to determine the possibility of cross-infection of several visitors to the toilet and the toilet environment with each type of drying.
The jet air dryer, which releases air at declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 miles/h), is able to blow off microorganisms from the hands and from its own unit and potentially infect other users of the toilet and bathroom in a radius of up to 2 meters.
Using hand dryers with warm air spreads microorganisms within a radius of up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
There was no significant spread of microorganisms when using paper towels.In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to assess various methods of hand drying.
There are the following changes in the number of bacteria depending on the method of drying hands:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to paper towels.
Hand cleaning with disinfectant towels can be an alternative when traveling without soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand disinfectant should contain at least 60% alcohol.
The medical method of hand washing became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignatius Zemmelweiss discovered its high effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in hospital conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget.
According to one study, using such devices actually helps reduce the level of infection.
Medical hand washing lasts at least 15 seconds, with a large amount of soap, water or gel used to wash and wipe each part of your hands.
The hands should be carefully rubbed around each other, crossing the fingers.
If there is dirt under the nails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since microbes can remain in the water present on the hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
After drying hands, closing the crane, as well as, if necessary, closing and opening any doors, a paper towel should be used.
This prevents re-contamination of the hands from these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in medical institutions is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“microbes”) and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the procedure for hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients, and thus spread microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other basic procedures can reduce the level of blood flow infections associated with the use of catheters by 66%.The World Health Organization has published a leaflet depicting the standard hand washing and treatment procedure that should be applied in the health sector.
The draft WHO Hand Hygiene Guidelines is also available on its website and open to public discussion.
The corresponding review was conducted by Whitby in co-authorship.
If confirmation of compliance with regulatory requirements is required, commercial devices can be used to measure indicators and check hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified five “moments” when you need to wash your hands:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
before using an antiseptic, and
Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap when washing hands (“medical” or “antimicrobial” soap) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgery or in an environment with a high content of organisms resistant to antibiotics. To "clean" hands before surgery, a crane is required that can be turned on and turned off without touching his hands; you should also use a little chlorhexidine or iodine water to rinse hands, sterile towels for drying hands after washing, a sterile brush for friction and other sterile tool for cleaning under the nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms to the elbow usually for 2–6 minutes.
It is not necessary to rub your hands for too long, for example, 10 minutes.
During the rinse, the water from the forearms should not fall back on the hands.
After the wash is completed, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and put on a surgical coat.
To reduce the spread of microbes, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after procedures to care for a sick person.
To combat staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20% of hand washing was the most beneficial, and that very few additional benefits were obtained when the frequency of hand washing was increased by more than 35%.
Compared to washing with antibacterial soap, washing hands with regular soap leads to a more than three-fold increase in the frequency of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. Comparing washing hands with an alcoholic solution and washing hands with antibacterial soap, on average 30 seconds per procedure, showed that hand treatment with an alcoholic solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than alcoholic hand solutions in terms of reducing the number of H1N1 influenza A viruses and Clostridium diffile in the hands. Hand hygiene development activities in medical institutions may include training staff in hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-containing hand solutions, and written and oral reminders to staff about the need to wash their hands.
Further research is needed on the most effective types of measures in various medical institutions.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective and important means of improving health and even digestion.
However, the lack of stable water supply, soap or hand washing in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to get the habit of regularly washing hands.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every private or public toilet has hand washing cranes, although there are also cheap ways to organize hand washing in such places.
However, poor hand hygiene can also be caused by rooted habits, not a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and encouraging hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term changes in population behavior.
To ensure the effectiveness of such measures, results should be monitored and evaluated.
A systematic analysis of 70 studies found that community-level sanitary and epidemiological surveillance is effective in improving hand hygiene in lower-medium-income countries, while public marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of the United Nations Children’s Fund’s Three Star Approach approach is that it promotes simple economic measures in schools that encourage students to wash their hands with soap, as well as other hygiene requirements.
By ensuring compliance with the minimum standards, schools can raise their level from one to three stars.
The installation of hand washers is one of the possible measures implemented as part of information campaigns on hand hygiene with the aim of reducing the incidence and child mortality.
Global Hand Washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behavior.As a result of the coronavirus pandemic of 2019-20, the United Nations Children’s Fund promotes the use of emoji symbolizing hand washing.
Some studies looked at the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to DALYs (saved years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that stimulating hand washing with soap is a much more cost-effective solution compared to other sanitary measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health — especially for vulnerable categories such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two innovators in the field of hand hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale, an English nurse and “founder of modern care for the sick.”
At the time, most people still believed that infections were caused by rotten odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, with outbreaks of diseases spreading through the digestive tract and infections associated with health care, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. began to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, next to hand washers in public toilets, as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports, posters with “right hand washing techniques” were hanged.
The phrase “washing hands” means manifesting your reluctance to take responsibility for something or to be a part of something.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate “washed his hands” when deciding to crucify Jesus Christ; later this phrase became more widely used in some English communities.
In Shakespeare’s “Macbeth” play, Lady Macbeth involuntarily begins to wash her hands in an attempt to clear herself of an imaginary spot symbolizing an unclean conscience, in connection with crimes she committed herself and prompted her husband to commit.
It was also found that people who remembered or observed any unethical behavior tended to wash their hands more often than other people, and handwashing is more important to them.
Also, it is less likely that people who have had the opportunity to wash their hands after the sight will participate in any other “cleansing” compensatory activities, such as volunteering.
In religions, handwashing has both hygienic purposes and symbolic significance. Symbolic handwashing with water but without soap is part of a ritual prescribed in many religions, including Bahá'í, Hinduism, Tevilah and Netilat Yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hygienic handwashing, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam prescribe the obligatory washing of hands after visiting the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after each meal.
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19 involves the use of occupational safety and health care methods to control risk and combat coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate risk control at the workplace depends on the location and task of the workplace and is based on an assessment of the risks, the severity of the community epidemic situation and the risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Office for Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA) that lower-risk jobs have minimal professional contacts with the public and colleagues, and such cases require basic anti-infection measures, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if signs of illness, adhering to the respiratory label, and conducting daily cleaning and disinfection of the workplace.
Medium-risk positions require frequent or close contacts with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19, but are likely to become infected due to the current spread of the disease in society or during international trips.
This category may include workers in contact with the public, for example, in schools, in high-density workplaces and in some large retail stores.
Risk control measures for this group, in addition to the basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation using highly efficient air filters, the use of protective screens and available personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
The OSHA believes that healthcare staff who have come into contact with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are in the high-risk category, with the risk increasing to very high when such staff perform aerosol-related procedures or sampling/processing from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures suitable for such personnel shall include the use of engineering and safety equipment, such as negative-pressure ventilation rooms, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the task concerned.
The outbreak of COVID-19 can have various types of exposure at the workplace.
Employees may be absent from the workplace due to their own illness, the need to take care of others or due to the fear of possible infection.
Commercial patterns can vary both with regard to the types of goods that are in demand and the methods of acquiring such goods (for example, making purchases in non-peak periods with delivery or service without leaving the machine).
Finally, interruptions in the delivery of goods from geographical regions affected by COVID-19 are possible.
The plans address the risks associated with different workplaces and challenges, including sources of infection, risk factors arising at home and in communities, and individual workers’ risk factors, such as elderly age or presence of chronic diseases.
The plans also specify the controls necessary to address such risks, as well as emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Epidemic preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or state-level recommendations.
Some of the targets of responding to the epidemic include reducing the spread of the virus among staff, protecting people at higher risk of serious health complications,ining business operations, and minimizing negative impacts on other organizations in their supply chains.
The response is influenced by the severity of diseases in the community where the business is located.
A risk management hierarchy is a structure widely used in occupational safety and hygiene to group such tools according to effectiveness.
If it is impossible to eliminate the risk of COVID-19 disease, engineering and technical safety measures are most effective, then - administrative measures and, finally, - personal protective measures.
Engineering safety means isolating employees from work-related risks and not relying on employee behavior, which may be the most economically beneficial solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in work policies or procedures that require action from the employee.
Personal protective measures (PPE) are considered to be less effective than engineering, technical or administrative measures, but can help eliminate some risks.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected depending on the threat to the employee, be suitable for size (e.g. respirators), be used continuously and properly, be regularly checked,ined in good condition and replaced as necessary, and be properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of in order to avoid contamination.
The U.S. Office of Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA) believes that jobs with the lowest risk have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic epidemic control measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, observance of respiratory etiquette, including hand-closing when coughing and sneezing, provision of towels and containers for garbage, readiness for remote or alternate work, if necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid using other tools and equipment, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is a critical step to protect employees, customers, visitors and others at the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease to stay at home until the heat stops, no fever, and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of antipyretics or other symptom-relieving medications, and prescribes policy flexibility on hospital lists, allowing employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and ensure that employees are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, positions with medium risk require frequent and close contacts at a distance of not more than six feet (1,8 m) with people for whom there is no confirmed evidence or suspicion of COVID-19 infection, but there is a likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the spread of the disease in the community in the area where the business is located, or due to recent trips of such a person to COVID-19 sites.
Such categories include workers who have had contact with the public, for example, in schools, a high-density working environment and some large personal retail stores. The engineering and security measures for such groups and groups with higher risk include installing highly efficient air filters or increasing the intensity of ventilation, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic protective screens, and installing windows for customer service without leaving the car. Administrative measures for such groups and groups with higher risk include recommending sick workers to stay at home, replacing personal meetings for work via virtual means, setting up alternate schedules, terminating non-duty travel in the COVID-19 spread environment, developing other personal communication plans in emergency situations, including for a forum to respond to worker’s less troubling regulatory issues, but providing the necessary equipment to provide the COV factor, we can include the ability to protect and limit the workplace with COVID-1 and the ability to protect and limit the workplace with such risks and resources.
In rare cases, employees in this risk group may need to wear respirators.
If a person is sick in an airplane, such measures are required to ensure the proper safety of employees and other passengers, such as isolating the sick person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a member of the crew to care for the sick person, giving the sick person a mask or asking such person to cover his nose and mouth with a towel when coughing or sneezing.
Secondary crew members must wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveller or in contact with salivary fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has a fever, regular cough or difficulty breathing.
Used gloves and other single-use items should be placed in a biologically safe bag, and contaminated surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected.In cases of commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, safety measures include postponing the trip in case of illness, self-isolation and promptly informing the medical center on board if there is heat or other symptoms in anyone on board.
Ideally, a medical examination should take place in an isolated cabin of such a person.In the case of schools and child care institutions, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
If there is a minimum or average level of spread of the infection in the community, social distancing strategies may be implemented, such as cancellation of trips for personal meetings, gatherings and other mass events, such as physical training or choral singing, eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between parties, regulating arrival and care times, limiting insignificant visits, using a separate location of health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
At a significant rate of spread in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, measures for prolonged school absence may be considered.For law enforcement staff performing daily duties, the immediate health risk is considered low, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who are required to contact persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are advised to follow the same instructions that are prescribed to ambulance personnel, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact during detention, employees must clean and disinfect their belt and equipment before re-use with household cleaning aerosols or by wiping, follow standard operational procedures to prevent the spread of the disease and the disposal of used personal protective equipment, as well as the use and washing of clothes.
OSHA believes that certain categories of healthcare workers and morgers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk positions include medical care, support, laboratory and medical transportation staff who contact patients with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected infection with COVID-19.
They have a very high risk of infection when performing procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, or when collecting/processing samples from individuals with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected infection with COVID-19.
Procedures accompanied by aerosol formation include probe, cough-causing procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or sampling by invasive methods.
High-risk morph workers include employees who treat bodies of people with confirmed disease or suspicion of infection with COVID-19 at the time of their death; if such employees perform screening, they move into the very high-risk category. Additional engineering and safety measures for such risk groups include the use of isolated rooms for patients with confirmed disease or suspicion of COVID-19, including when conducting procedures accompanied by aerosol formation.
In some health care institutions and mornings, the use of special negative pressure ventilation can be an effective measure.
The samples should be handled in accordance with the precautions provided for for Biosafety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be allocated to delimited waiting zones depending on suspicion of infection with COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective devices, OSHA recommends the use of respirators to employees who interact at a distance of up to 6 feet with patients with confirmed disease or suspicion of infection with SARS-CoV-2, as well as people who perform procedures accompanying aerosol formation.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved face respirators with N95 or higher grade filter must be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program that specifies requirements for individual selection and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for employees.WHO does not recommend using special clothing because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease transmitted rather than through physiological fluids.
The WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for staff performing screening at the patient’s reception point.
Individuals collecting respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19 or carrier of this disease without procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, the WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask, protective glasses or a protective screen for the face, coat and gloves.
When performing procedures accompanied by the formation of aerosol, instead of a surgical mask, a respirator N95 or FFP2 should be worn.
Given the inadequate availability of personal protective equipment worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such protective equipment by using remote medicine capabilities, physical barriers such as transparent windows, providing access to patients infected with COVID-19, only those who provide direct care, using only those personal protective equipment that are necessary for a specific task, prolonged use of the same respirator without removing, when working with several patients with the same diagnoses, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment and recommending not to use masks for people with no symptoms.

This month we are living in unusual circumstances.
COVID-19 is a phenomenon that has shed light on the relationship between people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We have had no precedent of such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to empathize, cooperate and develop the communities around the world that are at the heart of such an organization.
We have seen a friendly and caring relationship between all our colleagues, which is reflected in email, calls and chats – a remarkable confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, we have amazing people working with us.
I speak with great gratitude and pride about you as colleagues.
Last week I was informed of the high appreciation of our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia right now, and how beneficial it is for every person to have online access to this key resource.
And this is possible thanks to your work, whether it’s on ensuring the performance of sites, paying our colleagues, or protecting the security of communities.
The world needs the information presented on Wikipedia, and today it is even more important than ever before.
At such a time, in order to meaningful results for the world, it is important not only what we do, but how we do it.
Given the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes to the order of our joint work starting in the coming week.
Adjusting the order of our work and schedules
As Robin said earlier, the c-team team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
During the communication we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
The vast majority of us wanted to ease the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to retreat, let it be so.
For all staff, contractors and freelancers:
According to our expectations, it will be necessary to work about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before subsequent orders are received.
We do not announce weekends: if you can work normally for more hours, this is permitted for the purposes of our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now; no matter what your needs are, whether it’s taking care of your family, buying food or going to a doctor’s appointment, your well-being is our number one priority.
We do not monitor your working hours.
If you are sick, you should not work.
This is understandable and undisputed, but we mention it.
There is no need for a hospital or leave: just inform your manager and help the team review the calendar and schedule to ensure that key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, tell Brian from the T&C Ops unit so that T&C can provide support and due attention from the management to your situation.)
Payment of hourly rates will be carried out in full.
We have already announced and confirmed our intention to comply with our commitments to our contractors and employees with the hourly rate of payment.
Each person will be paid according to the usual hourly rates applied under normal circumstances.
This, in particular, implies periods of illness when you can’t work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use work as a way to direct their efforts to the world around us.
What we do can bring amazing results, especially at such times.
Again, it is about self-help.
We ask you to contact your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered substantial.
Such activities should always be supported.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety and Fundraising teams (among others) perform critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to evaluate current goals and shift the focus to providing support, which is critical to our mission.
There are many tasks for each of us, and we just focus on the most significant projects.
Delaying today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We don’t plan to work “two times as much to recover what’s lost” after the pandemic ends.
You will not need to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We acknowledge that the circumstances have changed and will work to set new goals and deadlines, if possible.
What is happening with the APP (Year Plan)?
In order to adapt to the new reality and expectations regarding the volume of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the timing of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of the deadline for our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time for budgeting, allowing employees to prioritize critical work, self-help and caring, while all who need or want to work will be provided with a shortened schedule for the next few weeks.
Such extension of deadlines can significantly reduce the current planning burden and tension across the organization.
Next week we will present our proposal to the Board, and we will inform the representatives and teams of the up-to-date information on the next steps as soon as confirmation is received.
Thank you to the APP team for their leadership in this work.
Office condition, risks and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco may have been infected with COVID-19.
However, in addition to many precautions, we hired an antivirus cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used antiviral solutions of medical class to disinfect all surfaces, as well as for reception and elevator halls, through which it is possible to access our floor.
The building applies its own rules, prescribing to be careful, using products that ensure the safety of their tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in Columbia County (DC) is part of the WeWork network, which has shared with us and all staff in DC its policies related to COVID-19.
Last week, our office in the District of Columbia completely switched to remote work in accordance with the instructions received in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the issue of renting a room in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues who work remotely know about the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended to limit the duration of meetings to one or two hours.
If you need longer sessions, consider breaking them into a course of several days.
Clearly define the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and send out materials in advance for familiarization.
By default, use video communication, and use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate interaction and communication.
For convenience, appoint a coordinator – a person who will monitor the arrival of questions in the chat and monitor the list of speakers, as well as responsible for keeping notes (or joint observation).
If you need to use a convenient headset, contact the technical support service by email.
Take advantage of your Wellness Reimbursement program when purchasing snacks.
Join Slack’s #remoties channel to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team studies the ergonomics guidelines available in the webinar format to promote the efficiency of distributed work across the organization.
Last week, we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel massive Wikimedia-funded events such as “editathons” until the WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We understand and inform that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may result in the impossibility of carrying out agreed grant measures, and no one will be fined for forced delays or changes to such purposes.
In the coming week, we will hold follow-up events with additional guidelines on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general mood in the global community is not only a sadness about interrupting work, but also a sense of relief about understanding and the ability to focus on your own communities, Wikimedia and beyond.
As for the prospects, CRT is working on a page in Meta-Wiki that will provide space for the community to monitor impact and communication.
We remain in touch on issues related to COVID-19
We will send in your calendar an invitation to a special staff meeting that will take place next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time we will take advantage of the opportunity to share up-to-date information, answer your questions and spend time together, connecting with each other.
We are together in this situation and ready to help everything we can.
At the same time, you can still receive information from such e-mail, and other important information on COVID-19 from Office Wiki.
The CRT will update such pages, and all the information will be gathered in one place.
We also work to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have been significantly affected by the current situation.
If you have questions about trips, events, key workflows, information disclosure issues, or other assistance you need, contact CRT.
We are ready to provide support and communicate when necessary.
If you have privacy concerns, please email Brian Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
No such change should be considered as a waiver of our work and our obligations.
Rather the opposite: it is a recognition of the possible current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and provide the opportunity to continue working, to provide the necessary support to our movement and the world with the right service.
Our planned work will wait until the appropriate times.
Today is the time to support each other and create space for important work ahead in the coming weeks and months.
In order for this to happen, we will need the help of each one of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, and to work with the utmost output as soon as such a need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), reducing angiotensin-II content and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal enzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 contains the N-terminal peptidase domain M2 and the C-terminal transport domain of renal amino acid collectrine.
ACE2 is a single-passing membrane protein type I, its enzymatically active domain falls on the surface of the cells of the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain ACE2 is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted with the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most alveolar type II lung cells, small intestinal enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and the smooth muscle cells of the arteries of most organs.
The biosynthesis of ACE2 andRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE counterweight.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into vasoconstrictor angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, divides the carboxyl final amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] bradykinin, apollin, neurotensin, dinorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the transporter of the neutral amino acids SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main cell entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Strictly speaking, binding the protein S1 of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 adhesion to the enzymatic ACE2 domain on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into endosomes located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the priming of S protein by the TMPRSS2 series carrier protease, the inhibition of which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent. This has led some to think that reducing ACE2 levels in cells can help fight infection.
However, many professional communities and regulatory bodies recommend continuing standard ACE and BRA inhibitors therapy.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, “the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the control group.”
Moreover, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients receiving ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than in patients at overall risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is believed to be an innovation in therapy for acute lung damage and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory failure syndrome caused by lipopolysaccharides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the duration of 24 hours.
Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 may be a promising remedy for people with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated.
COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile phones designed to assist in the epidemiological investigation in the context of the coronavirus pandemic of 2019-20, that is, in identifying persons ("contact") who could have come into contact with an infected person.
Many applications have been developed or proposed in some regions that are officially supported by the authorities.
Several applications for tracking contacts have been developed.
This has sparked a debate about privacy issues, especially with regard to those systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of app users.
Softer options in this regard include using Bluetooth signals to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they will join forces to integrate Bluetooth-based support for these apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government, together with Alipay, has deployed an app that allows citizens to check whether they have communicated with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities.In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is used.
The app was developed by local IT companies, is open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched the “StopKorona!” app, which runs on Bluetooth to help track contacts with potentially infected people and provide immediate communication with health authorities.
The app was developed jointly by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app awaits registration in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government announced that the contact tracking app is in the final stage of development and will be available for deployment within a few weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are considering the possibility of using applications based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use an app with geo-zone function, whose purpose is to ensure that patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security at the University of Cambridge, points out a number of potential practical problems that may arise with application-based systems, including false bootings and potential inefficiency if the app is used only by a small fraction of the population.
Given concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious coronavirus apps, Apple has limited the list of types of organizations that can offer their coronavirus-related apps on the App Store to include only “official” or other trusted organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Participants in the Privacy Shield campaign expressed concerns about the consequences of mass surveillance of the population through coronavirus-related apps; in particular, the question was raised whether the surveillance infrastructure created to fight the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled once the threat disappeared.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of such surveillance.
The organizations have announced eight conditions for government projects:
the surveillance shall be ‘legal, necessary and proportionate’;
The extension of monitoring and surveillance shall be accompanied by reservations on limitation of duration.
The use of the data should be limited to the purpose of combating the spread of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of data shall be protected and evidence of such security shall be provided;
digital surveillance should exclude cases of exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties must be regulated by law;
Protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse must be guaranteed.
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple are proposing a joint plan to address the problem of constant surveillance, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their device operating systems as soon as it disappears.
In some countries, network location tracking is used instead of apps, which eliminates the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking has been approved.
Network solutions that have access to source location data also have large potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location data; a number of confidential systems have been developed that use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a system that does not use apps as a basis was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking and card transaction data, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected individuals.
The government not only used this information to warn citizens of potential contacts with infected individuals, but also made location information publicly available, which was made possible due to substantial changes in information protection legislation that were made after the outbreak of MERS in that country.
Access to such information can be obtained through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider using both centralized systems and systems that maintain privacy.
As of April 6, 2020, the details have not yet been announced.
Privacy-related contact tracking is a well-established concept with a significant amount of research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than ten expert groups have been working on privacy-related solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record user approaches to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized tracking with privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), privacy protocols, mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that personally identifiable data never leaves the device and all comparisons take place on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform that ensures confidentiality when collecting and using location or crossing data to track the spread of COVID-19.
The platform’s work is based on research from the paper “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” published in March 2020.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technologies that allow users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and officials without compromising the confidentiality of such data.
On April 5, 2020, a global TCN coalition was formed by groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols, aiming to reduce fragmentation and ensure global compatibility of applications for tracking and alerts, which is a key factor in their widespread spread.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that it had uncovered the BlueTrace source code used in the operation of its official app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the operations of Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative that they claimed would ensure privacy, and based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography to keep privacy.
They also published the technical specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
Deploying tools that allow governments to create official apps to track the movement of coronavirus-infected citizens, but with data confidentialityined
By integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve permanent surveillance issues by first implementing the system through operating system updates and then removing it in the same way after the threat disappears.
Repositioning a drug (also known as re-profiling, redirecting, changing tasks or therapeutic re-directing drugs) is the re-profiling of an approved drug for the purpose of treating a disease or medical condition different from the disease originally envisaged in development.
This is one of the areas of scientific research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and reconvalescent plasma transfusions.SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 drug-affected proteins, each of which has several ligand-binding areas.
The analysis of these binding sites serves as a suitable basis for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, heliase, protein S and ADP-ribophosphatease.
Hussein AA and co-authors in their preclinical study examined several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analyzed their similarity in structure with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a highly effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug that would be recommended for clinical trials.
Chlorokin is an anti-malaria drug that is also used in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that chlorokin and its associated hydroxychlorokin will be among the four drugs investigated in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chlorine and hydroxychlorine will begin in New York State on March 24. March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychlorine sulfate and chlorine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment scheme has not been approved during the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency care in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under the clinical trial schemes.
The CDC said that “the sequence of use, dosage or duration of taking hydroxychlorine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection” has not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the drug when “there is no other way out.”
A Turkish research group in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale research is being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University School of Medicine in Langon studies the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychlorine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have shown that favipiravir is “unambiguously effective.”
In 35 patients in Shenzhen who took this drug, a negative result was obtained on average after 4 days, while in 45 patients who did not take the drug, the duration of the illness was 11 days.
In Wuhan, a study was conducted in which 240 patients with pneumonia were observed, half of whom received favipiravir, and the other half - umifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency reminded the public that the results showing the effectiveness of the drug are scarce and should not be considered final.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug in Japan to replenish its stocks and use military resources to deliver it to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe informed the Trump administration about the possibility of purchasing the drug.
Its use may be unsafe for pregnant patients or for patients who are trying to get pregnant.
According to the results of one study on the combination of antiviral drugs "lopinavir" and "ritonavir" (Kaletra), it was concluded that "the effectiveness of the use of drugs has not been revealed."
The drugs were developed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to proteases.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. The scientific community is criticizing the re-profiling of drugs that were specifically developed for HIV and AIDS therapy.
The WHO has included the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Subsequently, Gilead Sciences employees discovered that remdesivir has antiviral activity in vitro against a variety of phylum, pneumovirus, paramyxovirus and coronavirus.
One of the problems associated with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies show that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are currently underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Clinics; one is conducted on patients with a moderate form of the disease and the other on patients with a more severe form of it.
There are currently three clinical trials on intravenous administration of vitamin C for people who are hospitalized with a severe form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and one without placebo use (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, testing of the antibiotic Azithromycin began in New York State.
Japan’s National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical trial of Alvesco (cyclosonide) Taigi, an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma treatment, for its use in the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
The Phase II trial, a form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, was conducted with the participation of 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria, hospitalized with severe forms of the disease, in order to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
For the study called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 with mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization were invited.
Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding and do not use effective contraceptives may not participate in this study.
In Italy, several coagulants are being tested.
Low-molecular heparin is widely used for the treatment of patients, which prompted the Italian Department of Medicines to publish recommendations for the use of this drug.
On April 14, in Italy, a multicenter study involving 300 patients was announced to study the use of enoxaparine sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, significant scientific attention has been focused on re-profiling approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Recommendations.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese Recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially suitable for use as a treatment for COVID-19:
Tocylisumab (an anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also testing in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is the hypothetical coronavirus vaccine of 2019 (COVID-19).
Despite the fact that no vaccine has passed clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine are still being made.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it does not expect the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to be available before 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates underwent Phase I safety studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread worldwide, leading to significant investments in vaccine development and related research.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to provide the required speed, production capacity, scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the platform’s main objectives included in Phase I security research are:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, iRNA-1273)
viral vector (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)
As CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are being used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute); moreover, 37 candidate vaccines have been, but there is little publicly available information about them (presumably in the planning or development stage).
In stages I-II, preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing is carried out, usually randomized, placebo-controlled and in multiple locations with simultaneous determination of more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials typically cover more participants, including the control group; at this stage, drugs are tested for efficacy in terms of disease prevention and side effects are monitored at optimal dosages.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed by early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested on humans (they are still in the preclinical stage).
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that genetically modifies viral proteins to stimulate immune response.
On January 24, 2020, the International Centre for Vaccines (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the start of work on its own vaccine with the aim of starting human testing in 2021.

On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotech company in Quebec, that they had created a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institute of Health Research.
The potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory testing and testing on humans is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian that U.S. President Donald Trump offered CureVac “large sums of money” for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, against which the German government protested.
On March 17, 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop a vaccine based on iRNA.
BNT162 is a candidate for an iRNA-based vaccine; the drug is currently undergoing preclinical trials and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that it will receive the results of preclinical trials in April 2020, and their final vaccine candidate may start testing on humans in the fall.
On March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), France, announced an investment of $4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine development consortium with the participation of the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Wien, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh. CEPI’s total investment in COVID-19 vaccine development is $29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the universities of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different vaccine candidates on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplification RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced the allocation of $275 million to fund 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
At the same time, the Canadian government announced that it will allocate $192 million to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 and plans to create a national “vaccine bank” that will include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine testing PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine on mice, stating that “MNA injected subunit SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines, causing strong antigen-specific antibody responses [at mice] that appeared two weeks after immunization.”
On April 16, 2020, the Canadian School of Pharmacy at Waterloo University announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine that may be available in the form of a nasal spray.
With the help of bacteriophages, DNA will multiply inside human bacteria and form harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities combined the resources of IBM’s supercomputers with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other benefits in addition to disease prevention properties.
Another randomized study, conducted in Australia, covered 4,170 healthcare professionals.
The vaccines being developed may be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, indicate the need for measures to curb infection with Biosafety Level 3 in the processing of live viruses, as well as international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no medications or protective vaccines that are safe and effective for people to treat SARS.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of atypical pneumonia has been a priority for governments and public health institutions around the world.
When MERS began to spread, it was believed that the SARS study that was being conducted at the time could become the standard for the development of vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that passed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three more vaccines, all of which were virus-based vaccines and were in development, two adenovirus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media has spread conspiracy theories that the COVID-19 virus is not new at all, and that a vaccine against it already exists.
Posts on social media cited the words of some patients who claimed patents for the genetic sequences of other coronavirus strains, such as SARS, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), which is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include feeling tired, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of odor and abdominal pain.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases are reduced to manifestation of mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease flows into viral pneumonia and polyorgan insufficiency.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases of infection were in 210 countries and regions, with more than 153,000 people dying from the disease.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is mainly spread through close contact of people with each other, often through microscopic drops released into the air when coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these drops are formed by exhalation, they typically pose a threat by falling on the ground or on the surface, but are not transmitted through the air over long distances.
People also get infected by touching a contaminated surface, and then their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can live for 72 hours.
It is most contagious within the first three days after symptoms appear, although its spread may be possible both before symptoms appear and in later stages.The standard diagnostic method is a polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (RT-PCR) on a sample taken as a nasopharyngeal patch.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with suspicion of the disease, as well as those who care for them.
Recommendations on the use of medical masks by the population vary: some departments recommend not to use them at all, some recommend their use, and others require it.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19.
Local spread of the disease has been recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected individuals may have no symptoms or have flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent pain or feeling compressed in the chest, confusion, difficulty waking up, blue face or lips; if the above symptoms are present, you should immediately seek medical attention.
There may be fewer symptoms of upper respiratory tract diseases, such as sneezing, rhinitis or sore throat.
Also, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are observed in different percentages.
Some cases of the disease recorded in China were initially manifested only by a feeling of compression in the chest and accelerated heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease can progress, developing into pneumonia, polyorgan insufficiency, and as a result, death occurs.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms begin to appear within 11.5 days after infection. According to available data, symptoms do not appear in all infected people.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in the transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the infection.
The percentage of infected people with an asymptomatic course of the disease is currently unknown, it is only being studied; while the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) that in 20% of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations for the virus the course of the disease was asymptomatic.
The National Health Commission of China began including asymptomatic cases in its daily reporting since April 1; of the 166 cases on that day, 130 (78%) declined asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva can have a high concentration of the virus.
When speaking loud, more drops are released in the air than when speaking at a normal volume.
A study conducted in Singapore found that with an open cough, drops can spread to a distance of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
The virus is generally not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission of virus particles by bio-aerosol is still possible, and testing of air recycled by air collectors located in corridors outside human rooms has shown the presence of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and thus to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through the feces, however, this risk is considered low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; the virus may spread before symptoms appear, but this risk is small.
Workers at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) say that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one patient usually infects 2–3 other people.
In particular, it was found that on cardboard surfaces the virus can live for one day, on plastic surfaces (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) - up to three days, and on 99% of copper surfaces - up to 4 hours.
These indicators, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents, when used correctly, have a quite beneficial effect in terms of combating infection: soap destroys the fatty protective layer of the virus, thus deactivating it, and can also remove it from the surfaces of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective against this virus.In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and in the sixth patient the highest level of the virus in the blood was detected on the second day of the test.
Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome first detected in three people with pneumonia from the group with acute respiratory disease registered in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in related coronaviruses.
Being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens up its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organ most susceptible to COVID-19 as the virus penetrates into host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in alveolar type II lung cells.
The virus connects to ACE2 and penetrates into the host cell with the help of a characteristic surface glycoprotein - a "ship" (cappuccino).
12% of infected people who were admitted to a hospital in Wuhan were diagnosed with acute myocardial damage, which is more common in severe forms of the disease.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the systemic inflammatory response and disorders of the immune system observed as the disease progresses, but acute myocardial damage may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities because they are involved in the work of this organ.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous tromboembolism (25%) has been observed in patients in OIT with COVID-19 and may indicate adverse forecasts. Autopsy of patients who died from COVID-19 showed the presence of diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs.
Despite the fact that SARS-COV-2 has tropism to ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with a severe course of COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was found that pathogenic GM-CSF T cells correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL-6 and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytal infiltrates were also detected.
The WHO has also published several protocols for testing for this disease.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard test method.
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal smear, but a nasal or sputum smear sample can also be used.
Results are usually ready within a period of several hours to two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two blood samples taken at an interval of two weeks, and their results are not directly relevant.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world could independently develop tests using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the presence of the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, tests for antibodies that could detect the presence of an infection at the present time, as well as the fact of a possible infection in the past, were in the development stage, but have not yet gained widespread spread.
Chinese experience of studying the results of these tests has shown that their accuracy is only 60-70%.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test, giving permission for its use at the end of this month.Diagnostic guidelines issued by Zhongnan University Hospital of Wuhan specify methods for detecting infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multipleural subpleural sealing focuses of the type of "matte glass" with peripheral, asymmetric and aposteric distribution are common symptoms detected at an early stage of the disease.
Subpleural domination, the symptom of the bridge bridge (a longitudinal thickening of the partition with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
There is little data on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological study performed at the opening:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, sealing and swelling of the lungs
There are four types of severe viral pneumonia:
mild form of pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytal infiltration and formation of multinuclear giant cells
severe form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS) and severe hypoxemia.
healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in the alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse intra-vascular coagulation (DIV syndrome); leukoerytroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, adhering to respiratory hygiene rules, and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a towel when coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a towel, covering the mouth and nose with the inner side of the elbow area of the hand.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended to perform high-quality hand hygiene procedures.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue facial masks in public places, in particular to limit the transmission of infection by people with an asymptomatic course of the disease. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected patients with large groups of people; as part of these measures, schools and have been closed, citizens' movement has been restricted and major public events have been cancelled.
Distance guidance also implies that people should be at least 6 feet (1,8 m) away from each other.
As the vaccine development is not expected to be completed before 2021, the majority of measures against the spread of COVID-19 are reduced to reducing the epidemic peak known as the “out of the plateau.”
The CDC also recommends washing your hands more frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after a toilet visit or with severe hand contamination, as well as before and after eating, coughing, or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends the use of a disinfectant containing alcohol (alcohol content is at least 60%) for hand treatment, but only where soap and water are not available.
These compounds use ethanol or isopropanol, which have antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not suitable for hand antiseptic treatment.
Glycerin is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are shown supportive therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they are infected with the virus wear a regular medical mask.
Extra-corporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to solve the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
To strengthen immunity, it is recommended to observe the rules of personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet.
Supporting therapies may be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease.WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published guidance on care for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive care doctors and pulmonologists have summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in a free resource - IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
To treat symptoms as first-line medications, some health professionals recommend choosing in favor of paracetamol (acetaminophen) versus ibuprofen.
When performing procedures in which air droplets may occur, such as intubation or drying of hands, precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in medical facilities.
Healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19 are recommended by the CDC to be placed in an air dropling insulator (AIIR) – an additional measure in addition to the standard precautions in terms of contact and air.
Recommended personal protective equipment: protective coat, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but when used not according to the instructions, the effectiveness in terms of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends using protective face screens or, in extreme cases, make masks yourself at home.
In most cases, the forms of the COVID-19 flow are not heavy enough to require artificial lung ventilation or its alternatives, but there is also a certain percentage of cases when this is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 is currently being actively studied, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided by a nasal oxygen canyon with intense air flow or two-level positive pressure in the respiratory tract.
It is not yet known whether any of these two methods for critical patients is as effective as IVL.
Some doctors make a choice in favor of invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, if available, because this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to the nasal canyon with an intense airflow.
In many developed countries, there is a shortage of hospital beds per capita, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with the sharp increase in severe cases of COVID-19 infection requiring hospitalization.
According to one study conducted in China, 5% of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical lung support by ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in resuscitation.
The task of providing artificial ventilation of the lungs is complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developing with COVID-19 and oxygenation entail more and more problems.
Inhaled pressure-supported IVLs and PDVs are necessary to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to ensure minimal ventilation damage, which can lead to pneumotorax.
On earlier models of fans, high PDV may not be available.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently undergoing clinical trials.
The most promising is Remdesivir.
Development of new drugs may last until 2021, but some of the tested drugs have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stage of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of the disease.
Recommended WHO volunteers participate in testing the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments.The FDA has granted temporary permission for the use of reconvalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where human life is in serious or immediate danger.
Its use has not been subjected to clinical trials that must be conducted to prove the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app designed to fight the outbreak.
To log in, users must enter their name and identification number.
The app can detect “close contact” using observation data and thus determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation, but also sends a notification to local health authorities.Big data analytics collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence – such tools are used to track infected people and individuals they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security authorities to track cell phone data of people who are allegedly infected with the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to provide quarantine and protection for persons who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus, Deutsche Telekom provided the federal government agencies of Germany and the Robert Koch Institute with aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers.
In Russia, facial recognition technology has been introduced to identify violators of quarantine.
Italian Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said cellular operators that “40% of people still continue to move around the territory.”
The German government held a 48-hour weekend programming marathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O’Connor as saying: “Increased social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic downturn are ideal conditions for harming people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease can occur in a mild form with minor or absent symptoms resembling other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as a common cold.
Patients with mild form of the disease usually recover within two weeks, while treating patients with severe or critical forms may take three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, although similar data for COVID-19 is not available.
In individuals with the most severe course of COVID-19 disease, it can rapidly progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or polyorgan failure.
Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal thrombosis, and problems with the heart, kidneys and liver.
Thrombogenic abnormalities, an increase in prothrombin time, were in 6% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, while renal impairment was observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
According to early-stage case studies, the average time from the onset of initial symptoms to the day of death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8% and among women 1.7%.
Histopathological studies of posthumous lung samples indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The appearance of the lungs resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS).
In 11.8% of deaths by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were caused by elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89% of hospitalized patients had previous health problems.
Estimates of mortality by condition vary due to such regional differences as well as due to methodological difficulties.
Inadequately effective counting of cases in mild form can lead to an exaggerated mortality rate.
However, the fact that deaths occur as a result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
In smokers, severe COVID-19 symptoms were generally 1.4 times more likely to develop, and such patients were approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or die compared to non-smokers.
The administration of one of Hong Kong’s clinics found that in some patients who recovered from the disease, the volume of the lungs decreased by 20–30%, and their scans revealed damage.
After recovery, this can also lead to post-intensive therapy syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether patients who recovered from the virus developed a stable immunity against it.
Judging from the course of other coronaviruses, this is considered probable, but cases have also been when after recovery from COVID-19 coronavirus tests have still been positive.
It is believed that in these cases there was an exacerbated prolonged course of the disease, rather than re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural, has an animal origin and is an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to its transmission from human to human.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls December 1, 2019 the earliest date for the first case of the disease.
According to official data published by the WHO, this date is December 8, 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All numbers vary depending on the region and time of the disease spread, they are also influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment schemes used, the time since the outbreak and population parameters such as age, gender and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the disease emergency codes under ICD-10: U07.1 – for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 – for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV infection.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191).
Some other methods include determining the disease mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who died as a result of the disease, as well as determining the transferred infection mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases) who died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not tied to a specific time and reflect the indicators of a certain layer of the population from the moment of infection to the completion of the course of the disease.
Despite the fact that antibodies are not produced in all patients who have had the infection, by the presence of such antibodies it is possible to understand how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castillo d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600 people, 80 people (1,7%) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread during the celebration of the carnival among young people, causing a relatively lower mortality rate, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
In addition, the German healthcare system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, judging by donor blood rates.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0,004% of the population).
The impact of pandemics and mortality levels are different for men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher among men.
The most at risk group are men over the age of 50; the gap in indicators between men and women decreases only at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact causes of this discrepancy are unknown, but may be in genetic and behavioral factors.
Gender immunological differences, a lower prevalence of smoking among women, and concomitant diseases in men (such as hypertension in men at a younger age than in women) can cause higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of infected were men, and 72% of deaths from COVID-19 occurred in men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not conduct gender statistics for COVID-19.
Scientific studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, flu and ARVI have different gender statistics.
The majority of healthcare workers, especially nursing staff, are women, respectively, they are more likely to get infected.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease - COVID-19.
The head of the WHO, Tedros Adanom Ghebreyesus, explains: “CO” means “corona”, “VI” means “virus”, “D” means “disease”, and 19 is the year when the outbreak was first detected: December 31, 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (such as China), animal species or groups of people as required by international name recommendations aimed at preventing stigmatisation. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public reports, the WHO further uses the terms “COVID-19 virus” and “virus responsible for COVID-19”.
Both the disease and the virus itself are commonly referred to as the coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as “coronavirus” and “Uhansk coronavirus.”
In January 2020, in line with the 2015 Guidelines on the Use of Geographical Places in Disease and Virus Names, the WHO recommended the use of the terms “2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV” as temporary names for the virus and disease.
On February 11, 2020, the official names “COVID-19” and “SARS-CoV-2” were published.
Because of the volume limitations of standard supply chains, some digital service providers print medical materials, such as nasal tampons, as well as parts of IVF devices.
In one such case, an Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve and the supplier was unable to deliver it on time, then one of the local factories was re-profiled and was able to print the necessary 100 valves per night.
After the first outbreak of the COVID-19 outbreak, various conspiracy theories, disinformation and false information about the origin of the virus, its scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects began to spread on the Internet at a high rate.
It is possible that humans can infect other animals.
The results of the studies did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
There is currently no approved vaccine against the virus or medicines for its treatment.
Currently, various international studies of COVID-19 vaccines and drugs are being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the WHO launched the SOLIDARITY Trial program, which aims to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the four existing compounds considered to be the most effective to date.
There is no ready vaccine yet, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrate into human cells via the ACE2 receptor, so the scientific developments use the results of previous studies conducted on SARS-CoV.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers are seeking to create a fully virion vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to induce a rapid immune response of the human body to the new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at destroying the S-shaped protein that helps the virus penetrate the enzyme ACE2 receptor.
The third strategy is to develop vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new method of creating a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines developed according to any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody boost has been identified as one of the potential problems in the development of vaccines for SARS-COV-2, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
The drugs approved for the treatment of malaria were evaluated in seven trials, four of which were on hydroxychlorokin or chlorokin.
The re-profiling of antiviral drugs is the majority of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine phase III studies of remdesivir were conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for treatment of COVID-19 has been carried out. For the same purpose, several other existing antiviral drugs for treatment of COVID-19 are also being considered, including remdesivir, chlorochine and hydroxyclorochine, lopinavir / ritonavir, and lopinavir / ritonavir in combination with beta interferon.
As of March 2020, preliminary data on the effectiveness of remdesivir are available.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients receiving remdesivir as an exception.
Phase III clinical trials are already underway in the U.S., China and Italy. The use of chlorokin, previously used to treat malaria, was considered in China in February 2020, and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for expert assessment of the study.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chlorine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the emergency use of hydroxychlorine and chlorine at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese Guidelines also listed interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir as anti-COVID-19 agents.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitasoxanide was recommended for detailed in vivo study, demonstrating inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Studies have shown that for SARS-CoV-2 penetration through ACE2 receptor interaction, it is necessary to reconcile the spike protein with the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2).
Studies of the use of chlorokin and hydroxychlorokin with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that do not allow the medical community to use these treatments without further study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinemia may occur as a complication in the late stages of the severe form of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxyclorochin may possess hypercytochemical properties. As a result of a small study conducted by the National Health Commission of China, tocylisumab was included in the coronavirus treatment recommendations.
This drug went on stage 2 of a non-randomized test, which is conducted at the national level in Italy, after positive results were obtained from its use in patients with a severe form of the disease.
In combination with a serum test for ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counteract factors that are thought to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective case studies for treating steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by another cause, CAR T-cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocylisumab is an effective treatment for cytokine-release syndrome.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients who recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is currently considered a non-vaccinated method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested in the treatment of patients from SARS, but its results have proved unconvincing.
Virus neutralization is the expected effect by which passive antibody therapy can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or fagocytosis may also be used.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The scale of the use of reconvalescent blood serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies against this virus, may be increased.
