Biker responds lightning fast and prevents the worst
On Friday evening, a motorcycle rider was only slightly injured on the highway between Machtolsheim and Merklingen.
Motorcyclist misses biker
A 44-year-old woman was driving her VW from Merklingen and was about to turn left on the 1230 national road towards Machtolsheim at about 9:30 p.m.
She was overseeing a 24-year-old motorcyclist coming from Nellingen.
In the event of a collision, the hand and foot brake levers fly away.
The biker tried to avoid the car, but he still ran over it in the back.
The hit and run caused the Suzuki's hand and foot brake levers to break off and the driver was unable to brake.
Mindful, he steered his motorcycle into the green areas beside the road and let it roll off without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
The collision with the car nevertheless caused the biker to suffer a leg injury and had to be treated in a hospital.
Mamming: Mass infection of coronavirus: 174 harvesters infected
After a massive coronavirus infection at a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are not allowed to leave the plant.
A security service is monitoring the curfew.
A total of 174 harvest workers tested positive for the coronavirus agent Sars-CoV-2 in the series of tests, Dingolfing-Landau county council office announced on Saturday evening.
"To prevent further spread, we must unfortunately take this step to protect the population", said Werner Bumeder (CSU), a member of the European Parliament.
The Commission has already taken the necessary measures to ensure that the virus is not spread to the workers.
The farm is a large vegetable garden that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beets - but only for jars.
Mamming is a rural community of about 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW factory.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to remain calm: "According to our information, this is a closed circle of people".
In the farm, infected and non-infected workers have been separated, and the grounds are now surrounded by a barrier.
The Greens and the SPD gave the state government some responsibility.
The two opposition groups accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting to control the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can be a bitter revenge if such local infections occur and regional lockdowns have to be ordered", said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary executive director of the Greens.
The SPD sees this very similarly: "We have already demanded a special control programme for farms with harvest helpers after the corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May", said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"We believe that hygiene conditions at work and in the home must be strictly monitored.
Obviously, that didn't happen".
The outbreak was "with notice".
Subway station Aidenbachstraße: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into the track after being pushed
In a dispute between two groups of young people at the Aidenbachstraße subway station, a 19-year-old fell down and slipped into the track.
Obersendling - On Friday, at the Aidenbachstraße subway station, around 16.15 hours, a dispute broke out between two groups of young people.
A passerby alerted the police, who pulled up with several stripes.
According to preliminary investigations, a Munich man (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the platform and fell into the trackbed.
The 17-year-old's group helped him climb off the track.
There was no danger of an incoming train.
According to the police, there were further clashes between the two people.
The 17-year-old initially fled the scene, but his identities were later identified.
Accompanied by his father, he went to Police Station 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for assault.
Seehofer urges longer storage of data
The storage of data is currently suspended.
The Federal Minister of the Interior, Horst Seehofer, however, is calling for an extension of the storage period, following a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) is calling for a longer storage period for data - six months instead of the planned ten weeks - following a media report.
Seehofer's letter to Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) called for a swift change in the law, as reported by Bild am Sonntag.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense to "make urgently needed changes to the law now", the newspaper quotes the letter as saying.
The storage of data is currently suspended.
A decision on this matter is expected from the ECJ.
Seehofer, however, wants the amendments to be introduced in advance so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive ruling, the report says.
A spokesman for the Justice Department told the newspaper that the need for legal adjustments could only be properly assessed if the courts had ruled.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer had already in June, together with the interior ministers of the Länder, called for data storage.
NBA: Strip club upset for Clippers star Lou Williams
There's a lot of excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams, 33, a professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Clippers, reportedly left the tournament quarter at Disney World in Orlando, Florida with permission to attend a funeral.
According to US media reports, he was still visiting the Magic City strip club in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who reportedly admitted to the visit, according to ESPN, is back in isolation, getting tested daily for COVID-19.
His reason for visiting is chicken wings.
In February of last year, "Sweet Lou", as he's known in the NBA, already expressed his love for these very wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame have the best wings in the city".
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA has ordered a 10-day quarantine for Williams.
That puts the Clippers star out of the first two official games after the playoff rounds.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Corona season finale.
Currently, the top 22 teams are preparing for the season finale, which begins Friday night.
Southern says after mass infection on the Corona situation
The Commission has already announced a test offensive for large farms.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in Dingolfing-Landau has alarmed authorities and politicians.
The large vegetable farm currently employs almost 500 harvest workers from several countries, over a third of whom have been infected with the corona virus.
The farm is now under quarantine and is fenced off.
No one is to leave the premises. Food will be delivered.
The authorities are now offering free corona tests to the community's 3,300 residents.
As the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the county council office has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Conscience bites": confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client has been cooperative", lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The lawyer added: "He regrets his actions very much, the confession was a release for him".
He said his mandate was "tormented by remorse and deeply moved by the scale of the destruction".
If convicted, the man faces 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros, according to the prosecutor's office.
The Gothic Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul in Nantes was badly damaged by fire last Saturday night.
The fire broke out in three very different places in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The suspect, now in custody, had been arrested just hours after the fire.
He was released after one day.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no sign of a forced entry into the church, he quickly came under the scrutiny of the investigators.
Discussion on abolishing the 50+1 rule
The former DFB president Reinhard Grindel has recommended that the 50+1 rule be abolished.
"German football should at least discuss, set conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates finished facts", Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
He stressed: "For the clubs most likely to become dangerous, Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules don't work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented.
He doubts, however, whether the German Football League is prepared to allow majority shareholdings, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"There remains a legal risk of building investment fences around the Bundesliga business location in a European single market", Grindel said.
The former head of the DFB sees the danger that "attempts to create a more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but not lead to more tension in the league".
Even an equal distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
'FC Bayern has a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund 500 million and RB Leipzig 300 million.
So the differences between the first three clubs alone are already enormous.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million", the 58-year-old explained.
Grindel feels betrayed by the past.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who noticed this mistake and have stabbed through to the press instead of addressing me", Grindel said of accepting an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"This has been a very human thing for me".
The gift, worth about 11,000 euros, was given to him by a Ukrainian official.
"I have committed a breach of compliance and it was right to draw the consequences", Grindel said.
"I handled the ominous gift of the watch with complete transparency and no suspicion.
A lot of people in the DFB knew about it".
He never "made a big deal out of the gift", the 58-year-old assured.
"You might call it naive, but this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption".
"Black Lives Matter": One dead and one wounded
Protests against police violence in the United States have been intensified by Donald Trump's deployment of federal police in several cities.
On Saturday, clashes between protesters and police took place in several cities.
In Louisville, three people were injured, in Seattle, 16 people were arrested.
In Austin, one person was shot and killed as a protest train was crossing an intersection.
Earlier, clashes had erupted in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
Security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas on Saturday night and violently dispersed protesters.
Hundreds of partly armed protesters marched through Louisville, Kentucky on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for Breonna Taylor's death be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead in her Louisville apartment in March during a drug raid.
The target of the raid was someone else who didn't even live there, and no drugs were found.
On Saturday, three people were injured when a member of a group calling itself an armed alliance of black Americans opened fire.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in danger of death.
The police set up barricades because counter-demonstrators had formed a white militia.
The two groups did not meet.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and killed during a Black Lives Matter protest.
Police have taken a suspect into custody.
She has not yet given any details of the circumstances of the crime.
According to The New York Times, Mayor Steve Adler said he, like many in the city, was "consolated and dismayed" by what had happened.
In the American capital Seattle, protesters clashed with police on Saturday.
They set fire to a construction truck outside a juvenile detention center, and the police used grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resisting police or assault.
In the city of Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of protesters smashed windows, fired fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday night.
The fire was quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a crowd of people demonstrating on a highway.
Police said one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was taken to hospital.
In addition, windows were broken in a courthouse and a fire was set, police said.
An investigation has been launched.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes are defying Corona
Although the big sauce was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and highlights of the program such as halls, Rakoczy ball or parade, many still got their money's worth on the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading the Rakoczy flair", says Kurdish director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have taken it well.
In principle, one goes back to the beginnings of the Rakoczy Festival, when only the historical aspects were the focus of the festival.
A pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
And so it is this year of the corona.
The couple made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, watching the historic ones strolling and listening to live Cuban music at the casino restaurant.
"I find it quite pleasant", says Konhäuser.
She doesn't miss the crowds that are otherwise Rakoczy's.
But it lacks the usual highlights of the programme, first of all the hall burning on Friday evening and the historic parade and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's too bad.
The weather would have been perfect this year", she says.
Rakoczy equestrian tournament to be held again
For the performers of the historic spa guests, the alternative programme meant partly more work.
Like Christina Gold, who in a normal year attends the parade and is seen there on the stagecoach of the Kurgarten Café.
This year, she was out walking around town in costume on Saturdays and Sundays.
"It's more stressful, otherwise it's easier", she says.
The riders' association had less to do, even if individual riders were traveling in the park.
"We hope very much that the equestrian quadrille will be held again next year", says chairwoman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break, a Rakoczy equestrian tournament will be held again in 2021.
28 cases of coronavirus in Spanish second-tier club Fuenlabrada
Spanish football's second-tier side, CF Fuenlabrada, is slipping deeper into crisis due to a coronavirus outbreak.
Since the rookie from near Madrid flew to the city of A Coruña for a game on July 20 despite first coronavirus cases, a setback follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had tested positive, one of whom was hospitalized, the club said.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name southwest of Madrid had a chance to reach the promotion play-offs so far.
Now they're even threatening relegation to the second division.
The game against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was cancelled at the last minute, the prosecutor's office is investigating a possible offence against public health, the highest sports authority CSD is considering the forced withdrawal of the club.
The players and other team members are in quarantine at a hotel.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they have not received a fresh towel or gel", wrote the sports newspaper AS.
The photographs show players hanging their underwear and club clothes in their hotel rooms to dry after they had to wash them themselves.
She also said that she hadn't had her bed linen changed in five days.
Another problem is food.
"Neither good nor enough", wrote "AS".
The club management, however, said they were satisfied with the hotel.
The charge of deliberately endangering public health was rejected by the club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
The coronavirus rules set by the football federation were not violated, stressed the son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca".
Before the flight, there were four infected by July 19, but they had all been isolated and had not travelled with.
Just before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members were tested again.
When the team was in A Coruña, "five or six" other team members tested positive for the coronavirus.
The game was called off 60 minutes before the whistle, Tebas Llanas said.
Police must catch horses that have run off at the steam room
Two animals were walking on the road.
The police took it back to its owner.
On Sunday morning, just before 6 a.m., a road user reported two horses running free on the road between the Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld entrance and the Theres motorway junction.
When the officers arrived, the horses were already between the plow and the village of Dampfach.
After the officers had gained the confidence of the horses just before the steam locomotive, they each had a rope tied in the patrol car.
Tony Martin, professional cyclist: Continuation of career possible
Time travel expert Tony Martin is considering continuing his career.
Frankfurt/Main - Seven-time world time trial champion Tony Martin is well on his way to continuing his cycling career.
"I am currently working with the team to establish the framework for how and in what form it could proceed", the 35-year-old told the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
He said the negotiations with his team also involved the number of race days.
Or other problems that would plague him as a family man, Martin said.
He had been a former cyclist who got up after a fall and his first thought was, "Quick, get back on the bike.
Today, as the father of a young daughter, I think, "What if?"
The cycling pro admitted that there are aspects that are becoming increasingly difficult for him.
"But it was good to see what I have in cycling and how much fun it is for me during the Corona period".
The time trial specialist will be back in action at the Tour de l'Ain (August 5 to 9).
Bavaria: At least four dead on Bavarian roads over the weekend
The beautiful weather in many places attracts bikers to the streets.
For at least three people, the motorcycle tour ends in death.
An 18-year-old pedestrian also dies.
Schönthal - Several people, mostly young people, died in accidents on Bavaria's roads over the weekend.
An 18-year-old motorcyclist was picked up by a car on Saturday near Schönthal (Landkreis Cham) that came on the opposite track.
Why the car ran into the wrong lane was unclear at first.
In Upper Bavaria, a 22-year-old man on his machine collided with a horse-drawn carriage on Saturday.
Police say he was driving down the Beilngries.
In a left turn, he crashed into the carriage.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of the accident.
Of the 12 passengers in the carriage, one man was seriously injured and one man was slightly injured, police said.
In another fatal accident, an 18-year-old man died in Bad Kötzting, Upper Palatinate.
He had been lying on a road on Sunday night and was hit by a 42-year-old driver.
Police believe the 18-year-old was trying to sleep.
The driver couldn't brake in time.
A 57-year-old biker crashed head-on into a car in a right-hand corner near Schönberg (Landkreis Freyung-Grafenau) on Saturday despite braking full throttle.
He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver was hit by a shock, but the other three people in the car were uninjured.
The safety of motorcyclists was discussed on Saturday by Bavaria's Minister of Transport Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to the organizer of the biker protests against the ban announced for August, Gabor Kovacs, the minister referred to extensive investments such as under-car protection on guideboards and the defusing of dangerous curves.
"We have achieved a lot in recent years for the safety of motorcyclists", the letter said.
"The number of motorcycle deaths has decreased by about 28 percent since 2011".
Kovac is testing with Monaco against Frankfurt .
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - Football coach Niko Kovac is set to return to Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club, AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will be playing at Hesse, the former club of the Croatian, on 1 August (18.00).
For the Bundesligisten, it is the first and only test of toughness before the Europa League replay against FC Basel (August 6).
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the match will be played without spectators.
"We are particularly looking forward to this game.
It is always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends", explained Kovac.
The 48-year-old said it was an interesting test from a sporting point of view.
Before joining Bayern Munich, Kovac coached Hesse from 2016 to 2018 and led them to victory in the DFB-Pokal.
"A high-profile opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I am looking forward to seeing Niko Kovac again", said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croat in the agreement.
In March, the Frankfurter had lost the quarter-final match against Basel in their own stadium with 0:3.
Nearly 50 new infections: County Court just past lockdown
In the county of Hof, the number of known new corona infections continued to rise over the weekend: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person has recovered and is no longer in this statistic) to 47 on Sunday.
And then there's a case in the city court.
That brings the courtyard area closer to the critical mark of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in a week.
700 dead from monsoon rains in Southeast Asia
The severe floods in Southeast Asia have affected more than 9 million people, mainly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
A total of 700 people died because of the heavy monsoon rains.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent is trying to reach the isolated people in boats.
Whole villages are under water.
The farmers lost their crops.
Panther rhinos in national park dying from landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 antelopes died from landslides.
They are protected and considered endangered.
This year's floods are particularly severe, which scientists attribute to climate change.
Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming, according to the United Nations.
New homes are empty
In Cox's Bazar in southern Bangladesh, the state has built housing for 650 people displaced by the floods.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It's difficult to get people to Cox's Bazar.
The enthusiasm is also maintained in Grenezn.
Those who used to have a house, no matter how small and like a hut, often do not want to spend their lives in a large apartment building.
Many homes are empty, but the government wants to soon be occupied by those who have lost their homes to the floods.

105 people died from lung disease.
Argentina rejects counter-offer from creditors
The new requirements could not be met, the Economy Ministry in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"This would be not only irresponsible but also unfair", said one opinion.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term gains of our creditors".
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina is asking its private creditors to waive some of their claims of around USD 66 billion (around EUR 59 billion).
If no agreement is reached, the country will again face bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
The Commission has also examined the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
The Argentine Government, however, is sticking to its latest offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was more than 50 percent recently.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic strength of about ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had defaulted on US$503 million in interest payments, which led to a limited default.
Employed - not yet in private
"It's going super well" - this is the conclusion Dr Stefanie Kramer draws after her first days at the notary office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would succeed Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelden notary office.
Six weeks later, in early July, the lawyer with a doctorate began work, and normal day-to-day business was already in full swing.
"I still have to get there", she laughs in a conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger.
The short lead time was not enough to completely move the center of the population from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, says the native of Dingolfingen.
She said she and her husband, who is a judge at the regional court in Regensburg, were currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband was still able to apply for parental leave at short notice to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order to avoid having to commute from Regensburg every day, she has also been able to stay overnight with her parents in Dingolfing, the 39-year-old explains.
She grew up in the neighbouring county and has known the town of Eggenfelden for a long time.
She said that during visits to the area with her family in recent months, she had once again found that "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful little town".
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented.
Her hometown of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's career: after studying law in Passau, she completed her period of practice and the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several stints as a notary, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Lower Alps and Regensburg - during this time she also completed her doctorate in labour law - she took up her first job as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, followed by a move to Regensburg.
Since then she has been representing clients in various notary offices.
The 39-year-old explained that when the job in Eggenfelden was advertised because of the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for the full professional re-entry.
The team of her predecessor, who will be taking over the holiday representation at the notary office, has taken over completely Dr Stefanie Kramer - and has a compliment for the team of the firm: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on the workings of the facility makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of her private food hub.
In the case of kindergartens and cribs, she has already contacted a local institution.
And if all goes as planned, she hopes to soon be able to pursue her hobby here too - and to experience the most beautiful jogging trails of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not be even 20 percent full at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the mandatory social distancing, we are planning to have between 12,000 and 15,000 spectators at the moment", Borussia Dortmund manager Carsten Cramer told the daily Mirror.
The arena in the district town usually holds just over 81,000 spectators for Bundesliga matches.
In the ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic last season, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitalisation and internationalisation at BVB, hopes that some of the around 4000 seats in the hospitality sector will be able to reopen in addition to the normal seats: "It is obviously a blow to the office if these revenues completely disappear".
In view of the ongoing coronavirus crisis, everyone is currently "advised to first take a stable side length".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are short-term, then the need for entertainment is limited", Cramer explained.
The Dortmund marketing manager praised the BVB professionals for their partial salary cut, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary cut has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-time work".
Small Miracles: Early Start in Life with a Few Grams
Barely heavier than a pack of butter, just three tablespoons of blood all over his body: That was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The boy is one of about 400 babies who are cared for annually at the Graz Children's Hospital.
A quarter of them weigh less than a pound [1,500 g], and a few - such as Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extremely lightweight, weighing less than a pound [0.5 kg] at birth.
They are so small and so early born that neither lungs, intestines, nor muscles are fully developed.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that they could damage the electrodes of an EKG.
And they're so tiny, they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini-diapers made just for them.
But not so small that they would not be able to speak - "and how", Berndt Urlesberger smiles.
"Although they may not scream as loudly as big babies".
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona theatre in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced just before the holiday began the 9th grade of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsmünd.
The actress Julia Sylvester from the Aalen City Theatre presented the production "The Home Robe" to the pupils - via video.
The students were then able to exchange views on the play and the performance via Skype with the actress and director Winfried Tobias.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the enrichment of the lesson.
Although all participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and on stage would provide additional incentives, the theatre also has the potential to bring people into contact with schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game business", emphasised director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: TSV 1860 would face Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
If TSV 1860 qualifies for the DFB Cup, the Lions will face Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This was the result of the Sunday draw.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB-Pokal are determined.
The Lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualifying round.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday evening on the ARD sports show.
Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the field of participants is not yet complete, so the draw used placeholders.
Due to the voluntary withdrawal of semi-final opponent FC Memmingen, TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4 or 5 September).
There, the Lions will meet either the Würzburg Kickers or Victoria Aschaffenburg.
If Würzburg reaches the final, Sixty would already be qualified for the first round of the DFB-Pokal.
Otherwise, the Giesinger team would have to win the final against regional league champion Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB-Pokal will be played between 11 and 14 September, a week before the start of the third league.
"Gone with the Wind":
The film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died of natural causes on Sunday in Paris at the age of 104, her spokeswoman confirmed to the German Press Agency.
De Havilland was best known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in Gone with the Wind (1939).
Born in Tokyo to British parents, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
Austrian playwright Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia from Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream".
Warner Brothers immediately signed her to a seven-year contract and brought her to the forefront alongside Eroll Flynn.
She made eight movies with the heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar for her leading role in To Each His Own.
The film was released in Germany under the title "Mother's Heart".
Three years later, she won the award for Best Actress in William Wyler's The Heiress.
She also received much recognition as a neurotic eccentric in The Dark Mirror and The Serpent's Den.
Daphne du Maurier suggested her in 1952 for the lead role in the film adaptation of her novel "My Cousin Rachel".
The play became a worldwide success.
She and her longtime friend Bette Davis played in "Cradle for a Corpse".
From her marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) she had a son, Benjamin.
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had a daughter, Gisèle.
This marriage also broke up.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath, however, have never been confirmed.
Road to Timmendorf: beach volleyball:
World Cup runners-up Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler have missed the final of the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
In the semi-final, they defeated their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen by 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
The last time Thole/Wickler played was last September at the World Tour Finals in Rome.
In the final on the Rhine, their conquerors Ehlers/Flütgen were defeated by the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in early September in Timmendorfer Strand: The tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
The FDP has been accused of being a "scammer"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is, in the view of the FDP, only a fig leaf and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only the tip of the iceberg of radicals in the AfD", FDP internal politician Benjamin Strasser told the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided by majority in May, after a several-hour hearing in Stuttgart on Saturday.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD were really about consistently removing right-wing extremists from its party, officials like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago", said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will in the AfD to do so because right-wing extremism has now become part of the party".
The CSU's general secretary, Markus Blume, said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded does not mean anything and does not change anything", he told the "Welt am Sonntag".
"It is rather telling how many frenzied supporters an extreme right-wing in the midst of the AfD still has".
Blume expects the AfD to fall below five percent in future elections.
"The AfD's days in the parliaments are numbered".
The report also highlights the need for a European Parliament and Council directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens.
In May, the AfD's national executive had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
He cited Kalbitz's failure to mention his membership of the now banned right-wing extremist Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend (HDJ) and the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the Left Group in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without Kalbitz".
The decision will not weaken the Bundestag or the right wing.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen troop is transparent.
You want to avoid further surveillance by the constitutional protection and try to get under the radar", Walter said.
"The AfD will not get rid of the ghosts it has called.
The European Parliament has also adopted a resolution on the situation in the former Yugoslavia.
"Here the AfD and the party have held him as their rightful leader".
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
The Federal Court of Justice announced on Saturday that it would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms produce 21 percent more electricity
The wind farms on the German North Sea have supplied 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity to the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a 21 percent increase on the same period last year, said Bayreuth-based Tennet.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of North Sea current to the mainland and for its transmission through the German electricity network.
The wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's network area, have supplied a further 2,22 terawatt hours (TWh).
The total amount of wind power from the North and Baltic Seas thus amounts to 13,73 TWh, compared to 11,64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The harvesting of offshore wind accounts for almost 19 percent of all wind power in Germany, about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide more generation capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is due to higher generation capacities, in addition to wind conditions, due to the addition of new wind farms to the grid in the last 12 months.
If the 1,270 wind turbines in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate an estimated 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this, Tennet says, at 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we will invest €20 billion by then in expanding offshore grid connections", said Tim Meyerjürgens, CEO of Tennet.
In reality, even offshore wind farms cannot reach their full capacity, but only about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year was January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, equivalent to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could power almost seven million households.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the Gallery of the Gmünd Kunstverein.
It was almost a little 130th anniversary party.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition "Skirmish" with works by Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke the usual framework after the Corona break.
Many more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the art association, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Granhausplatz.
The association "Sandtogether" was involved in the north of the gallery.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled because of Corona
The Windberg Festival won't be held this year.
The city of Freital has canceled the three-day festival planned for September.
In previous years, over 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We have not taken this decision lightly and, knowing how difficult it is economically for those involved, we have hoped until the last minute", said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (non-partisan).
"But ultimately, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people here as the organisers".
If tens of thousands of people had flocked to the mainland and the tent, minimum distance, hygiene and contact tracing would not have been possible under the current coronavirus regulations.
Or the restrictions would have been so severe that there would not have been much left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring burden would increase disproportionately by many times.
Rumberg said he'd be back next year.
Then the city of Freital will celebrate its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympic champion Werth in the men's javelin throw
Achleites - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Austrian Achleites.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg won four races over the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix with Weihegold and Quantaz at the start, she was unbeatable in the Grand Prix Special and the Curling on Sunday.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold, Werth won the special on Sunday against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on the back nine.
The German was also in the court on Saturday on Quantaz clearly ahead of her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Worth's winning horse, Quantaz, is owned by Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is set to establish the 10-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first cure ever.
Even at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all four important tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms
The University of Worms is taking a further step forward: the DFS German Air Traffic Control is setting up a new chair in Air Traffic Management.
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
The professorship is a possibility to start studying not only in the summer but also in the winter semester.
This will enable twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacity at both the DFS University and the DFS Air Traffic Management Academy is used equally.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and staffing of the professorships.
Since 2019 represented at the university
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students are studying Air Traffic Management at the University of Worms as part of their training to become air traffic controllers.
This year, nine students have already started.
The experience of the DFS so far has been very positive, the students' performance excellent.
The combination of study and pilot training is a major contributor to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"It is not easy for us to finance it at this time.
We firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to continue to fulfil our legal mandate, we need highly qualified staff", says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and CEO of DFS at the signing of the contract.
"For the DFS, the Foundation Professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, cross-disciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue the good cooperation with the university and at the same time strengthen our attractiveness as an employer".
This is also emphasised by Professor Dr Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University: "The Foundation Professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With this programme we would like to build on the already existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's programme Air Traffic Management".
The German air traffic controller's confidence was both a motivation and a commitment for Worms University to further develop its teaching and research capabilities in the future fields of aviation.
In the context of the future air traffic controllers, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first foundation professorship for a dual degree programme.
Dr Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Training and Culture, emphasises: "Worms University has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus on aviation.
The signing of the cooperation agreement today strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue helicopter lands on the A45
For about 30 minutes, the A45 motorway in the direction of Aschaffenburg was completely closed on Saturday afternoon, as the rescue helicopter was in operation after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old man drove a Ford around 12:40 in the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the middle of the curve straight ahead and landed on the control panel.
The impact triggered the Frontair airbags, causing the driver to suffer minor facial injuries and had to be taken to hospital for treatment.
The 72-year-old passenger was treated by an emergency doctor and the patient was then flown to a hospital by rescue helicopter.
At this time, the police believe there is no threat to life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused about EUR 2000 in damage, had to be towed.
Heil wants to explore other sectors after meat
The Corona crisis has brought to light the conditions in parts of the meat industry once again.
The law is about to be tightened.
But are they legitimate - and will they remain so?
The Federal Minister for Labour, Hubertus Heil (SPD), wants to check other sectors as well, following the strict rules against irregularities in the meat industry that are now planned.
"We will look at each sector and then take appropriate measures for each sector if necessary", Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting employment contracts generally.
After the massive outbreak of the coronavirus at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation on Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ outside personnel for slaughter, cutting and processing.
The Commission has also proposed to prohibit the use of contract workers and temporary workers.
Employers' president Ingo Kramer told the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of employment contracts and workers' leave if you do not want to completely strangle the economy".
Works contracts are, for example, the basis for their value creation for customers in a wide range of sectors, such as the craft, construction and plant engineering sectors.
"The failures of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My aim is not to ban employment contracts everywhere in the German economy".
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the information provided by the Member States is accurate.
"When an industrial company hires a craftsman to install a safety system, it is a normal work contract".
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary work in its sector alone to be unconstitutional.
It is not possible to explain why the portioning and packaging of cheese should be subject to different labour laws than sausage, says a statement on the bill, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented.
Many Eastern European workers from contractual enterprises worked in the sector, according to the results of an audit by the NRW Occupational Safety and Health Administration, some 16 hours a day.
Often they didn't have a break.
Wages were deducted for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the housing of workers was often miserable.
Heil said a relatively strict law on meat production had already come into force in 2017.
However, "tricky designs" have been used to avoid these.
"Now we have to clean up the mess".
The politician announced: "The health and safety law, which we intend to pass in the cabinet at the end of July, also includes measures that affect not only the meat industry - for example, higher safety inspection rates or clear criteria for community accommodation".
The draft law before the dpa includes amendments to the Law on the Protection of Employees' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Law on Occupational Safety and Health.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
"I wish we could do more controls in many areas of supervision: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, including animal transport", Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB programme "Brandenburg aktuell".
But more controls also require more staff.
Three dead in crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
Three people have died in the crash of an ultralight aircraft on a multi-family house in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia, according to police.
A child was slightly injured.
Two other people were injured in the accident, said a spokesman for the Wesel District Administration.
A parachute was found at the crash site, police said.
The Rheinische Post reported, citing eyewitnesses, that the plane had collided with a hot air balloon before the crash.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Details were not initially known.
The evacuation of Frankfurt Opera Square peacefully
A week after the riots in Frankfurt, the evacuation of the Opera House in the night of Sunday has also gone peacefully.
Last time, several dozen people were still on the square, but left before curfew began at 1 a.m.
The police were on duty with numerous officers since early evening, and a larger police presence was visible throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend, a curfew was imposed on the opera house, where riots broke out a week ago.
Police officers had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of celebrants.
At least five officers were injured, police said, and several police vehicles were damaged.
Saturday night had also been quiet.
Young woman seriously injured in accident on Federal Road 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old woman was seriously injured at about 1.25pm on Sunday.
She was taken to the Kassel Clinic.
The fire department used thermal imaging cameras to search for possible passengers.
According to police, the woman was driving on Federal Road 83 towards her home in Hümme when her car, for reasons that have not yet been clarified, came off the road and overturned several times.
To save the injured, the fire department had to cut the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear if anyone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent cornfield was searched from the rotary with a thermal imaging camera.
The Warburg drone squad, which also operates thermal imaging cameras, was also ordered to search for people.
But the emergency workers found no one among the tall cornfields.
The seriously injured woman was taken by ambulance to the Kassel hospital for further treatment.
Almost 50 firefighters from Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on the scene.
The federal road was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a saving goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin have secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team behind the five-time world champion made the 36th Scudetto in the club's history with a perfect 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday night in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1-0 before halftime.
With 83 points, Turin, which entered without the recently injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is two days away from the end of the Serie A season and will not be pushed from first place.
Second-placed Inter Milan are seven points behind.
Juventus were harmless in the first half despite having an optical advantage, then Ronaldo hit the last action after a free kick.
Miralem Pjanic's extra play was used by the 35-year-old from the penalty area line directly with a flat shot (45. + 7).
Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0 against the now more offensive guests, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67.) dusted off.
This ensured the lackluster but decisive success.
The foul-ball shot into the net in the 89th minute was probably the only one Ronaldo himself had to correctly answer in terms of the goalkeeper score.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically on top of the ball for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily", said coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1-2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
The Juve coach said that his players were especially mentally exhausted.
Because of the defeat, the Turin team had not yet been able to perfect the championship.
The last time Juve had a reassuring lead at the top of the table, it was mainly due to the weakness of the competitors.
Because in the eleven games before Sunday's game, Sarri's team had only managed five wins.
Whether Ronaldo will become the goalkeeper king is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, former Dortmund player Ciro Immobile has already netted 34 goals after his three-pointer in the 5:1 (1:1) win over fourth-placed Lazio Roma at Hellas Verona - the same number as Robert Lewandowski contributed to FC Bayern's title win.
The record in Italy is held by current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football will have another chance at the title.
Juventus are in the Champions League quarter-finals, but they have to make up a 0-1 draw against Olympique Lyon on 7 August to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would be waiting as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threats of fines and court rulings, motorists continue to gas up in the countless illegal races on the streets of Baden-Württemberg: Last year and the first four months of this year, police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
Although there are no comparable figures for previous years, the rasers are increasingly making the judicial authorities work: In 2018, a total of 155 investigations were conducted for illegal racing at the public prosecutors' offices between Konstanz and Mannheim, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year by the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less organised events, as shown by the Ministry of the Interior's response to a request from the SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously ran into each other or fled from the police - this too is reported as an illegal race.
The majority of the drivers were German men aged 18 to 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the rasers caught and asked to pay the fine: According to the Ministry of Interior, a total of 113 fines and 15 prison sentences have been imposed since 2018.
There is no evidence, however, that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers were more sensitive to the tragic accidents and trials of recent years and reported more frequently, a ministry spokesman said.
Highway 8 is especially popular with the racer. Drivers often brake traffic to make room for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught under the Teck near Kirchheim, three months before 18 on the A8 near Merklingen.
The A81 is the most popular "race track"
In fact, the police register more races on the A81 than on any other federal highway.
The aim is to slow down the lawns on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen by using a speed limit.
The most expensive and upscale sports and luxury cars often have Swiss plates because drivers avoid Germany for the grass because of the high penalties for speeding and car races in the neighboring country.
The SPD cannot allow the speed limit to be reduced to a few routes: "A general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour would solve this problem on motorways", says Martin Rivoir, the SPD's transport expert.
"The barrier to racing would be much higher if you weren't allowed to drive 200 kilometres per hour or more legally here and there".
Rivoir is less concerned about education or image campaigns: "Those who go against all the rules in this way and put not only their own lives but also the lives of other road users at risk are hardly reachable by reason".
ADAC calls for more police action
The ADAC, on the other hand, is not satisfied with this: "We assume that the speed limits will not deter the racers", says Holger Bach, head of the Transport and Environment department at ADAC Württemberg.
He called for additional and even stricter controls on the routes concerned.
The high-priced strength test often turns into a more painful and consequential seriousness: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people across the country died during the races, two of them uninvolved in a night crash in Stuttgart city center and one in Gerlingen.
It's where two young men allegedly got into a car race in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, hit a garden wall and fell to the side, killing the 18-year-old passenger.
21 other people have been injured in the races of the past two years.
However, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, no more severe penalties are needed: "There is no need for legislation to punish illegal motor racing more severely", says the Interior Ministry paper.
July 23rd, blue light: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snack bar
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack bar in Rohrdorf (Calw district) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in Valley Road around 3:40 a.m. and ran towards the diner.
There he noticed a man serving drinks at the refrigerator and then leaving the snack through a previously locked front door.
The perp fled toward the meadows behind the diner.
The burglar also used a cash register to steal cash in the low three-digit range, police said.
The suspect is described as being about 5'7" to 5'8" tall and of a stout stature.
He was wearing a black hoodie, black pants and light shoes.
The police are taking any further witness testimony.
Ackermann sprints to victory in the final stage of the Sibiu Tour
Cycling pro Pascal Ackermann has won his second day of competition on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old from Palatinate, who plays for Bora-hansgrohe, won the 109-kilometre section with start and finish in Hermannstadt in the mass sprint after winning a stage on Saturday.
It was season three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall standings, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed.
The 26-year-old had decided to ride the mountain time trial for himself in the morning and thus took the lead in the classification.
Only 104 riders had entered the final stage by the evening.
No fewer than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in mountain time trials.
"I'm really happy to start the season with a win", Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic", said the 26-year-old.
He said that 300 meters before the finish he simply put on his sprint, "and it worked perfectly".
In accordance with the rules of the UCI, all participants and their companions were tested for corona six days before the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and supervisors were isolated in hygienic bubbles, separated from the organising team and the media.
Spectators were not allowed at the start and finish.
The command center gave instructions to resuscitate the layman .
The Commission has decided to initiate a procedure for the adoption of a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling of foodstuffs.
In a multi-family home, a child (4) was lying dead in the water while bathing.
Fire department says the 911 call came in just before 1:00.
"A dispatcher at the control station immediately gave instructions for the layman to be resuscitated", a fire department spokesman told BILD.
The rescue workers who arrived shortly thereafter began resuscitation.
The child, whose life was in danger, was taken to the hospital for intensive care.
Why it crashed is unclear.
The police have routinely started investigating the cause of the accident.
Fire department spokesman: "We're assuming a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: Unauthorised tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1,000 people participated in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to increase control over such events.
A large tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg's southern city.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police in central Franconia, around 22.30 hours, the Nürnberger traffic police detected an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstädter Straße.
The police then carried out a series of vehicle searches.
Only recently had the police announced that they would step up their crackdown on so-called car-posters.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: only a small part of the "scene"
The officials counted at the top 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police said.
However, only a small proportion of the participants were from the "autoposers" and tuning scene.
Apparently, most of the scene involved was a response to the police call.
The vehicles and persons present at the scene suggest that the majority of the victims were bystanders.
In addition, the majority of those present complied with the rules on infection prevention in force, in particular the minimum distance and the wearing of mouth-nose protection.
The on-site inspection was completed at around 1:00 a.m.
In total, officials found that 10 vehicles had been so modified that their operating licence had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car racing
There were no illegal car races.
'The police headquarters in the centre of the province will continue to monitor the situation and will continue to implement enhanced control measures, including in relation to the presence of bystanders,' it said.
News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger of the tow company involved: "They all have nice rims, we must not scratch them", says Schrödinger.
Special tapes would be used.
The company also said that because the cars are wider, it must be careful not to cause damage.
"I want the young people to get their cars back, unharmed".
Figures from the Labour Office: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-term work
Berlin - The Federal Employment Agency (BA) says it is investigating some 900 suspected abuses of short-term workers' allowances.
"This is extremely low for the more than 880,000 companies that have declared short-term work", said Daniel Terzenbach, the managing director of operations, to the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When the coronavirus crisis began, many companies suddenly applied for short-term work, the BA had to react quickly.
The examination usually takes up to three weeks.
"We didn't have that much time in this hot phase.
The more we look at the final accounts, the more we will see.
I'm sure there's a lot more to come.
We're not naive and we're long-winded".
The report also highlights the need for a more effective approach to the problem of discrimination.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to detect patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, BA is preparing for a possible wave of bankruptcies in the fall.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than last year?
The estimates vary, but we are preparing for the case and are already training our employees in employment agencies in handling claims for insolvency".
The figures are still unremarkable, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage site in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people were celebrating a party in the Neues Garten.
The gathering was dissolved at 8:48 p.m. by the district drivers of the Foundation Prussian Castles and Gardens (SPSG), the Foundation informed on PNN request.
The teenagers then left the park.
On Saturday night, some young people were playing rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow was cleared by drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
There are always illegal parties in the parks
In the parks of the Foundation, there are always gatherings where the distancing and hygiene rules of the Covid-19 code of conduct are not respected.
At the end of June, a party was held in Babelsberg Park with about 300 people, and a week later, about 150 people celebrated in the Neue Garten.
Even without a Corona order, the parks are closed at nightfall.
Camping on the meadows is prohibited by the parking regulations, with few exceptions.
The foundation has long complained that visitors are leaving more and more trash behind and destroying protected habitats.
In Berlin, meanwhile, illegal park parties have taken on a new dimension.
In the Hasenheide in Neukölln district, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was dispersed by the police.
Austria: Mass testing in tourist area after coronavirus outbreak
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a coronavirus outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, according to the Linz state authorities.
More than 100 results were still outstanding that evening.
According to the report, many of the infected are young trainees in tourism, but at least one vacationer tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism workers were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The curfew was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations" of bookings, said the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, to dpa.
Some guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about a third of the guests are Germans.
By Friday, the first infections had been made public.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behavior of the trainees who had been partying in several places and could have been infected there.
"We all liked doing that in our youth", he told radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees about the dangers of Covid-19.
Starting Saturday, hundreds of employees, vacationers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who had been in St. Wolfgang since 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak brings to mind the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre of the spread of the coronavirus across Europe in the early stages of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The new infections are concentrated in Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - Manchester United, the English football champions, are back in the Champions League after a year's absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the Premier League on the final day of the season with a 2-0 (0:0) win over direct rivals Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League, because FC Chelsea still passed and also qualified for the King's Cup as fourth.
In the fight against relegation, Aston Villa were able to cheer.
Manchester United took the lead with a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in extra time, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) reached the final.
Chelsea, in the Champions League eighth-finals opponent of FC Bayern, won thanks to Mason Mount (45. + 1) and Olivier Giroud (45. + 4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"It means a lot to me", said coach Frank Lampard, who is in his first season as Chelsea coach and is in the FA Cup final against Arsenal.
Chelsea's victory over Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who with a lean 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace still passed the Wolves and started sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the away game against Watford and Bournemouth, but had to struggle for a long time to keep the club together.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84) was immediately matched by Andrej Jarmolenko (85).
But that was enough because Watford lost to Arsenal 2-1.
The club, which fired three coaches this season, is relegated after five years in the Premier League.
Just like Bournemouth, who couldn't save themselves with a 3-1 (2:1) at Everton.
There was a point missing at the end.
Liverpool, who have been English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1:1) win over Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the points record in English football.
The best score is held by Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After Newcastle's lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38), Divock Origi (59) and Sadio Mané (89) took the lead for Liverpool on Sunday.
"It was an exceptional season for this wonderful club", said goalkeeper van Dijk after the game, "which should give us the impetus to defend the title.
It's going to be hard".
The Premier League bosses should be happy in the end.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were suspended from 13 March to 17 June.
Meanwhile, there was even talk of an early cancellation or a neutral venue for the remaining games.
The season was played out without any major incident, but as in Germany, without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrest and violence in anti-Netanyahu demonstrations
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are getting more violent.
There have been violent clashes in the night.
The Israeli police violently attacked demonstrators in Jerusalem on Sunday night against the right-wing conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people have been arrested for taking part in the riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
The police used water cannons to disperse the demonstration.
According to media reports, a total of about 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu's office on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the coronavirus crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration supporting Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site Ynet reported.
Protests also took place in many other places in Israel, including outside the prime minister's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray on protesters by the roadside from a moving car, police said.
Another man was arrested after stabbing a protester in the south of the country.
The protester had been slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv there have been several recent demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The demonstrations are part of the corruption trial against the head of government.
Recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the coronavirus crisis.
He is being told, among other things, that he is being too quick to relax and that he is not prepared for a second wave of the coronavirus.
The corona crisis has hit the country's economy hard.
The unemployment rate was more than 20 percent recently.
The number of new coronavirus infections in Israel recently rose to new record highs.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - van collides with car - nine injured - Ruhr area - Bild.de
Ahlen - A hit-and-run accident on the B58 near Ahlen on Saturday afternoon left nine people lightly injured.
A woman was driving her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
Police: "She probably brake suddenly because she was turning".
The driver of a Mercedes van behind her must have seen it too late.
He crashed into the back of the car.
Three occupants in the car and six in the van were slightly injured in the accident.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea closes border town after suspected coronavirus case
North Korea has so far seen "bright success" in its own measures to ward off the coronavirus.
Now, for the first time, the country is reporting a suspected case.
Due to the first official suspected case of coronavirus in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a major city for fear of disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological controls over the past six months, "the malignant virus may have been brought into the country", state media reported.
The Commission has also been informed that the situation in the region around the border town of Kaesong has been declared a state of emergency.
The Communist leadership has declared the highest level of alarm.
If confirmed, it would be the first official case of Sars-CoV-2 infection in the isolated country.
North Korea has so far reported no infection and described its defence measures as "a resounding success".
The data have been questioned abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly found in a "dissident" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person had left for South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the border.
The border crossing within the four-kilometer-wide and largely still mined military buffer zone was not initially confirmed by South Korea.
However, the South Korean military has acknowledged the possibility of illegal border crossings into North Korea as high, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap.
There have been studies on some people.
North Korea said it called an emergency meeting of the Workers' Party Politburo chaired by leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday over the suspected case.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster".
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a precautionary measure to "completely blockade Kaesong and isolate each district and region from others", it added.
The person concerned and all people in Kaesong who may have had contact with her have been quarantined.
The Central Military Commission of the Party is to investigate the "breakout" and the behavior of the responsible military unit and impose harsh punishment if necessary.
In Kaesong, there are an estimated 300,000 people.
Tension ahead of Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still up for discussion ahead of the summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will vote on the development plan for the large-scale inner-city development project East", says the city press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 16.30 in the Great Hall of the CongressCenter Pforzheim.
The upgrading of the East City in particular is controversial to the end.
The majority for this is small, and in recent years it has even been negative in some committees depending on the number of people present.
A call from the business community (construction, real estate, trade and IT) to ensure that the project, which was developed by the citizens and then by the administration and the municipal council, does not fail after almost ten years of preparation, was criticized by project opponents Reinhard Klein as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "unwitting", "speculation", "deception" and "deliberate false claims".
"Everyone thinks they know better", says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim list.
In fact, he was in this position after reading the treaties: "I know what I'm talking about".
The city is cheaper to move out, the Technical City Hall is contrary to statements of the city administration after subsidies, of which Klein is convinced, for 8,5 million euros to renovate.
The city will develop quite differently from what is predicted in the town hall and by the businessmen.
The FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also opposes the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the open-air maintenance of the Castle Hill, the leasing of the ex-Thales for administrative space and a smaller-scale downtown redevelopment, ideally with local bodies.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
The municipal council will vote on the noise action plan, among other things.
This includes various measures to protect the Alzheimer's population from the health effects of noise caused by road traffic, often including speed reductions.
In a press release, the local Transport Club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30, but says that the city's politicians are not innocent of this, because by neglecting regular bus and bus traffic with thinner speeds and by not paying much attention to cycling, they have contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the city's participation in the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
The agenda also includes the accession of the state of Baden-Württemberg to the climate pact, the re-establishment of parental contributions in municipal day care facilities and the application for inclusion in the federal Smart City funding.
Citizens are welcome, but must take precautionary measures.
With a long delay , Tim Zimmermann is entering the new season .
With almost a half year delay, Tim Zimmermann will start his inaugural season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the Supercar League could start regular operations, the first test drives were now in progress.
For Zimmermann, it was mainly about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking his first duty ride in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargener completed his first laps on the Lusitzring and was able to get used to his debut in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season", says Zimmermann.
"For example, the ABS makes it difficult to go into curves.
But it was really fun".
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
The Dutchman has only 25 years of experience in GT racing and has been able to help his new teammate in many ways.
"I am not a beginner in motorsport, but each new series brings new challenges", says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand each other brilliantly and we have made tremendous progress from session to session at the Lusitzring".
It is there, at the Lusitzring, that the GT Masters will also host its first race.
Starting July 31, the 33 super sports cars will race through the island of Luzon.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers, knows the track.
He was last a guest at the Motodrom in 2015.
"It worked quickly and I had little time to get used to the track", says Zimmermann, who races for the Graf Zeppelin racing team in Friedrichshafen.
"The Lusitania ring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann really is, we'll find out in two weeks.
"The teams play a little poker during the tests", he says.
"But in the end, we are very satisfied and looking forward to the first weekend at the Lusitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a busy calendar.
There are seven races until the beginning of November.
The current situation is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a celebrity guest.
In mid-August, at the Nürburgring, former Formula One driver Niko Hulkenberg will take the wheel of the GT.
British transport minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine Spanish holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has, according to press reports, taken the country's transport minister by surprise.
The Commission has therefore decided to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented.
Due to the rising number of coronavirus cases in Spain, the Cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine requirements.
The new rules will go into effect today, Sunday, and Shapps will be quarantined upon his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the rule does not apply to those who are on holiday on the day of the deadline until Saturday, 1 August, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain is, by the way, considered by Austria to be one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Many ministers must have known in advance that there was a possibility of a quarantine being imposed on holidaymakers in Spain", said Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one bothered to tell Grant Shapps".
Almost a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict curfew, the infection numbers in the country are rising again.
Virologists blame the nightlife for the new outbreak.
Spain is one of the British's favourite holiday destinations.
The UK government is currently advising against unnecessary travel to mainland Spain, with the exception of the Canary and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been recorded in Spain.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on the Navy Day in his country that the warships would be equipped with the most advanced hypersonic weapons.
These weapons, unique in the world, would expand the combat capabilities of the Russian Navy, Putin said Sunday at the Central Naval Parade in St. Petersburg.
The Ministry of Defence also informed Interfax about successful tests of the Zircon hypersonic missile built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of about 1,100 feet per second.
They're considered the weapons of the future.
Underwater Tropedeo is being built
The nuclear-capable underwater torpedo Poseidon was also under construction, it said.
The planned seaplane is designed to destroy coastal targets.
The President, who himself was riding a military boat, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be put into service by the fleet associations of the largest country on earth.
Russia has a coastal area as large as any other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been protecting Russia reliably, Putin said at the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
The Navy Day was also marked by parades in many other Russian coastal cities.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated its strength at an arms show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
There was also ammunition fired.
A video released by the Ministry of Defense showed not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hannah" hits Texas: Aid made difficult by Corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this season has made landfall in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains are now threatening parts of the United States, the National Hurricane Center of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said on Sunday night.
Governor Greg Abbott has declared a state of emergency in several counties.
The coronavirus pandemic in Texas is making it harder for aid workers to do their jobs, Abbott said, according to US media.
Evacuees Warned to Be Careful
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge", Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle.
In reference to the hurricane in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and will be exacerbated when you consider that it is sweeping through an area that is the most affected by COVID-19 in the state".
According to Johns Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died in Texas alone so far as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
Abbott warned people who were forced to leave their homes to be careful.
They should not disregard practices "we've gotten used to", such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
He said it was important that everyone kept their distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
And they're going to test for corona in emergency shelters.
Damage was initially only reported from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, authorities said the "Hanna" hit Padre Island just off the Texas coast.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest category one hurricane.
A storm surge warning was initially issued for the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a slowdown as "Hanna" moved inland and headed for northeastern Mexico.
Douglas is moving to Hawaii.
In the Pacific Ocean, Hurricane Douglas was moving toward Hawaii on Sunday night with winds of about 90 miles per hour.
The Hurricane Center, however, expected it to continue to weaken.
The forecast is for it to approach the larger Hawaiian Islands on Sunday (local time) and then form a storm just below hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA was expecting an above-average active hurricane season this year, following a forecast in May.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are expected, of which up to six could become very strong cyclones, the authority said.
On average, there are six hurricanes over the Atlantic each year, three of which develop into major storms.
Given the climate data available and the higher water temperatures in the Atlantic and Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, and that of a below-average one is only 10 percent, it was said at the time.
US President Donald Trump tweeted that his government was closely monitoring the storms and was in contact with the affected states.
Four goals conceded: video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic was denied two goals in the same period.
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals conceded: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a rabid night at 0:2 (0:1) at SSC Naples in the Italian Serie A and was really angry at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival of unclaimed goals for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR been so harsh on a team", commented Corriere dello Sport.
Host Napoli had taken the lead in the eighth minute with a goal from outside defender Elseid Hisaj, and Filip Djuricic cheered the equaliser in the 32nd minute.
The video assistant referee (VAR) withdrew the shot due to a sideline position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic again threw the ball into the net - again the VAR intervened.
The goal of Francesco Caputo (50.) and Domenico Berardi (61.) were also withdrawn by the referee team.
In the second half, Allan made the 2-0 score for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road, punishing Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology is setting records", says the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard is injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League started with a setback for doubles winner FC Bayern.
After a short holiday and a few days of training, Hansi Flick, who has recovered "somewhat well", has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfield boss Joshua Kimmich, has suffered a ligament injury to his left foot and is in danger of missing out on crucial first-class matches.
In the muddy weather in Munich, the right-back interrupted a practice game and was driven off the field with a golf card.
How long the full-time regular player has to take a break from the title fight is up for grabs.
A return to the semi-final against Chelsea on 8 August is unlikely to be a viable option for the 24-year-old, who is hoping to play in the final tournament starting on 12 August in Lisbon.
The Bavarians won't let the misfortune of Sunday's training stop them.
Flick named in his personal triple formula the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on their way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration will be on display for his title-hungry collectors in the next 28 days, ideally, until the King's Cup final on August 23.
"We have done our duty with excellence, with championship and trophy.
Now we have to make it special", said Flick.
Until the Munichers can deal with the final tournament and before that a training camp in the Algarve, but first the eighth-final tie against FC Chelsea.
After the 3:0 in the match before the Corona break, the Londoners should not become the Bayern nightmare again in the home arena as in the lost "final dahoam" 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and build confidence with a good game", Flick said.
A match-fixing test is scheduled for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had taken 13 days off after the double, to a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players at Säbener Straße, including the new players for Edel-Purchase Leroy Sané, who met all his new colleagues on the pitch for the first time since his transfer from Manchester City.
"Leroy has been adjusting well, like all the newcomers", Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. can no longer only train, Flick much preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, the Londoners are now training in team strength, unlike the Flick ensemble, who are in rhythm.
After that, the Munich side could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, while in the semi-final, Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are potential opponents.
A path to the final in Lisbon "is not so easy", stressed the head coach, who can count on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
World Cup-record scorers Klose and Flick know so much about joint tournament preparation, what's especially important in the 0-on-100 matchup.
Flick said working with his current team was "a pleasure".
He said that "focus on winning" was an impressive trait of his team.
The tournament with nine teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
All the big players were there, including the deserter Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose stay beyond the season is not guaranteed.
Formula One needs a special rule to cure its world champion
Since the required number of continents cannot be driven, the FIA has to improvise to award the World Championship titles.
All the races in the Americas have been canceled.
The race calendar is becoming more specific
The race calendar for the current Formula One season continues to take shape.
The ten confirmed Grands Prix have been joined by three more racetracks during the week.
In October, the race will be held at the Nürburgring in Germany and Portimão in Portugal.
On November 1st, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will battle for World Championship points at the Italian race track in Imola.
The 2020 race calendar thus comprises 13 races at the current level.
"We are pleased that we are continuing to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season", said Formula One boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the premier class of motor sport are to be held in this exceptional season.
Formula One is about to conclude its season in Asia.
The final race schedule is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, media reports suggest that there could be more races in Vietnam and Malaysia in late November.
The rules require racing on three continents .
The rules of Formula 1 require that the World Championship be held on at least three continents.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are covered, there is to be a world champion.
The FIA has a special rule that the titles are awarded on the grounds of "exceptional circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional season start in Australia in March had to be cancelled at short notice due to the looming coronavirus crisis.
A return to the continent later this year is not an issue.
Furthermore, Formula One will not be a guest in America this year.
The rejection is met with criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense coronavirus situation, the races in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Brazil will not take place.
"We look forward to being with them again next season", Carey explained.
The cancellation of the America's Cup was met with criticism, especially in Brazil: "The cancellation came as no surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it", said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the São Paulo Grand Prix.
The number of infections in the São Paulo area is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not wanting to race in Brazil would also not justify a cancellation.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a detailed description of the measures taken.
Greta Thunberg: Donald Trump was looked down upon around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's popular Late Night show via video link and revealed in the interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US late-night talk show via video link.
She told of her struggle against the world's powers.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "evil look" when she met Donald Trump.
NEW YORK CITY - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention with her tireless work for the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she's on a popular late-night talk show about her future plans and her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Late-night host Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg on your show Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powers.
"There are some things that surprised me", she said.
"How far people go to divert attention from the climate crisis", she said.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children goes out on the street", she said.
Heads of state and leading politicians who mock her on social media or even try to silence her find her "funny" because they show her the reactions "since they have no other answer".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed in a well-known scene in which she gave US President Trump a bitter look.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, where the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip turned into a GIF, an animated image that eventually became one of the most used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think of the president of the United States at that moment?
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect, and I am sure that the Commission will be able to do so.
The experienced satirist Colbert had not expected the quick answer and disappeared from the picture laughing briefly.
She was remembered by many at the climate conference for her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection.
Former Dortmund player Immobile with three-pack for Lazio Roma
Ciro Immobile is now tied with Bayern's Robert Lewandowski in the race for Europe's Golden Shoe.
Former Dortmund player Ciro Immobile has the best chance of becoming the top scorer in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional contributed three goals in the 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Roma at Hellas Verona, including two converted eleven metres in the second half.
The 30-year-old has now 34 goals in his first two games - the same number as Robert Lewandowski of Bayern Munich scored in the Bundesliga last season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the top rider in the evening at Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died.
His life was like a roller coaster ride: after a quick climb with Fleetwood Mac, it went downhill and then slowly up again.
Now blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Genius guitarist, drug addict, cult following, co-founder of Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday, with a further statement to be announced in the coming days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton have praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all past and present members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
Drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green formed the now legendary band in London in 1967, and his dream instrumental hit "Albatross" is still memorable.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") was like a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
One of the reasons for the dispute was that Green wanted to donate all the group's profits to charity.
He began to appear in broad robes and with a large crucifix.
Mental problems are also said to have played a role.
Green left the band in 1970, just three years after its formation.
There was a social decline.
The blues-rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in a psychiatric ward.
For much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived on the streets for a time, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 into a Jewish working-class family in Bethnal Green, London.
He was already a fan of American blues musicians like B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned his first guitar strings.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to perform as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
A little later, he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton in the Bluesbreakers.
In the midst of the blues boom, Green formed Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 along with fellow Bluesbreakers Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
Green's song "Albatross" gave the group their first number one hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But his rapid rise soon revealed its dark side: Green was not able to resist the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more extreme.
He later commented in an interview on his life between music and addiction: "The worst thing that ever happened to me in my life was drugs - the best thing was landing a number one hit".
Toward the end of the decade, Green achieved surprising success in 1979 with a religiously-inspired album.
Fleetwood Mac, meanwhile, were swimming without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite various minor solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until 1996 when he started again with a group of musicians friends.
The British Daily Telegraph reported at the time that a rock star had returned to Earth.
Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group before the band disbanded in 2004.
To music experts, he was already a blues legend in his lifetime - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
