I was given a restraining order, which is that I cannot attend mass events in public and not speak to the organizers of the April 7 protest.
"All this time I wore an electronic bracelet and a base.
That's how they tracked my location.
I'll say I wasn't restricted in movement.
Recently I flew from Moscow, where I was studying", - said Andrei Borovikov.
After the verdict was announced, Navalny's regional headquarters coordinator announced that he would serve his sentence in Arhangelsk.

So each of us needs to think about the reasons for these bad matches.
We're still in the middle of a meeting. We need to prepare for it and fix it.
How did you do that?
If we had known, we probably would have fixed it already.
But first, I think we need to add a component like a one-on-one fight.
I think we have a problem with that.

There's administrative liability for the violation.
The Kremlin is positive about any solution that helps save lives.
"We know how many fires occur, many of them have very tragic consequences and a public resonance.
Therefore, any life saved justifies such decisions", Peskov said.
First, the press secretary sees this as a firefighting measure, not a way to protect the neighbors from tobacco smoke.
Peskov also noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin does not welcome smoking and is a supporter of healthy lifestyles.

China strongly opposes the adoption of the Taiwan Bill by the United States
China is strongly opposed to the US adoption of the so-called "Taipei Bill", which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of the three Sino-American Joint Communiqués.
This was announced on Friday by the official representative of the Taiwan State Council's Chancellery Ma Xiaoguan.
The U.S. Senate Committee on International Relations' approval of the bill is also a serious violation of international law and the basic principles of international relations and a gross interference in China's internal affairs, said Ma Xiaoguan.
He said Taiwan is part of China and related issues are China's internal affairs.
"We call on the American side to clarify the situation, immediately stop promoting the relevant negative bills, and immediately stop interfering in the Taiwan issue to avoid further damage to China-US relations, as well as peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait", he noted.
China must and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone or any force, Ma Xiaoguang stressed.
TikTok hides unpleasant videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.
Imagine China / Reuters
The Chinese social network TikTok is censoring videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibet's independence or the banned Falun Gong, The Guardian reports.
The documents that were released by the publication say that the owner of TikTok (the ByteDance company) is using the app to promote China's foreign policy goals abroad.
Most of the violations of China's policies fall under the category of "hate speech".
In each case, TikTok places unpleasant posts in a context that is appropriate for the general rules so that social media actions do not look like censorship.
For example, a ban on criticism of China's socialist system is a general ban on "criticism or attacks on the politics and social rules of any country, such as a constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc".
The ban on mentioning the Tiananmen Square incidents or the Cambodian genocide is a "telling of the history of China or other countries".
The document also lists the banned names of twenty "foreign leaders or government figures", including North Korean leaders Kim Jong-il and Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, US presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Kin-hee, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, the document says.
First-class posts are removed by social network administrators and can result in user blocking.
The second category is not too severe: similar posts remain on the site, but their distribution is limited by TikTok's algorithms.
ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer applicable: "We now use a localized approach to moderation, and we also attract independent local experts".
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publishing, says co-founder of the Producer Center Rustem Bogdanov.
Production Center is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All the advertising materials of the "Producer Center" bloggers are coordinated with the representatives of the social network, but the user materials can be posted without agreement, Bogdanov reports.
Asked if he could comment on politics or Putin on TikTok, Bogdanov said yes and said he had seen such posts.
Bogdanov agrees with the founder of Our Didgital, Roman Zaripov: "The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: you can't post shocking content, discriminatory statements, and so on".
But you can put any content that moderators don't like under those rules, Zaripov notes.
Zaripov's agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.
According to the user agreement, only people over 13 years old can use TikTok.
Social network administrators check their age using artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, Bogdanov says.
If the neural network decides that the user is younger, his account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow in September 2019 on the territory of WeWork.
Istanbul residents told about the earthquake in the city
A strong earthquake has caused panic in Turkey 's largest city
Last Thursday, September 26, there was a 5.9 magnitude earthquake in Istanbul.
34 people were injured, 10 of them still in hospitals.
Istanbul resident Melike admitted that she had a panic attack for the first time in her life.

I was crying right at work.
It was easier later, I went back to work.
But I'm so ashamed now!" she told "360".
"There was a real strong earthquake in Istanbul
I can't go back yet!

The ROSH Health Inspectorate reported on the results of the examination of the fact of amputation of the hand to the child
The child in Rostov region was amputated because of a mistake by doctors, reports "Vzгляд" with reference to the website of the regional authority of Roszdravnadzor.

The inspection revealed that there were violations of timeliness and correctness of diagnosis, as well as the standard and extent of assistance.

Russians warned about fake calls from banks
In Russia, there has been an increase in the number of calls from fraudsters who replace bank phone numbers.
This is reported by Kommersant, citing data from the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator gave telecom operators information about more than 2,500 numbers that were used to call clients of various financial institutions.
In 189 cases, operators have detected a number change.
Another 218 numbers were blocked, and 59 cases were restricted to financial services.
Deputy head of the Central Bank's information security department Artem Syichev said that a wide range of Russian banks have been faced with the number change.
He explained that operators do not always respond to Central Bank warnings about fraudulent calls, citing the lack of such a duty in the "On Communications" law.
The Opening Bank, Rosbank and Alpha Bank confirmed an increase in fraudulent calls with a change in number.
According to the press service of the BILIN, some of the information about fraudulent calls that the Central Bank transmitted was incorrect: the lists included numbers that are actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Blocking them would cause a breakdown in the organization's work.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of fraudsters' numbers, which the operator will contact at each call to verify the number.
He explained that such a framework would require amendments to the legislation.

Earlier, it was reported that Google and Facebook were being tested.
Piskarev also said he would ask the Foreign Ministry to decide on further accreditation of Deutsche Welle, which the commission found in its publications to be justified in extremistry.
In September, Roskomnadzor detected political advertising on Google, Facebook and Youtube.
According to the agency, this happened during the Russian elections on September 8.
The facts of the violations were referred to the State Duma.
Google later said the company supports responsible political advertising.
According to the staff, she is obliged to comply with the laws of the country.

The head of the Russian public prosecutor's office Alexander Jarov accused the company of using double standards when placing political advertising.
Stoltenberg discussed with Zelensky the accession of Ukraine to NATO
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky discussed Ukraine's membership in the alliance on the sidelines of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
The secretary general spoke about this during a speech at Columbia University in New York.
Asked if the relevant topic was raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said they were indeed discussing the issue, and also stressed that in his reply he did not name the dates for Ukraine's accession to NATO.
According to him, any country that wants to join the North Atlantic Alliance must meet certain conditions to meet specific standards, writes RT.
Crimea offered the Green alternative to the NATO course
Ukraine's President Vladimir Zelensky should instead of taking the path to NATO, work on building good-neighborly relations with Russia.
This was reported on Friday, September 27, by the co-chairman of the Assembly of Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea Roman Chegrinets.
"The president of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but should listen to the advice of [US president] Donald Trump, which he listened to with a bitter face, and to establish relations with the president of Russia", - said Chegrinets to reporters "RIA Novosti".
Chegrinets noted that Zelensky is a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
According to him, the Ukrainian president will only be able to stay in power if relations with Russia are established.
Earlier on September 27, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he had held a conversation with Zelensky on the country's entry into the alliance.
According to him, Ukraine is obliged to meet certain conditions.
On June 5, the deputy of the Rada, Evgeny Balitsky, said that Ukraine's possible entry into the alliance does not guarantee a better life in the country.
Money is more important than football.
Barcelona is blackmailing Neymar
Spanish club Barcelona and its former Brazilian player Neymar are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the striker moved to French club Paris Saint-Germain.
The case almost went to trial, but the Catalans offered the player to settle the dispute without the intervention of Fémida.
Otherwise, they refuse to let him return.
Neymar and his cunning father, who is also the Brazilian's agent, have devised an interesting trick: under the agreement with Barcelona, which the player signed in 2016, he was to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, the forward was in the "PSJ" for a record 222 million euros.
Still, he got 22 million from the Catalans and now he wants the remaining 18.
Not only that, but the Brazilian's lawyers insist that the club owes him interest on the late payment.
When Neymar's claims were made known in the Catalan capital, Barcelona filed a countersuit.
The Blue Grenades insist that the bonus was for the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player was due only a quarter of 40 million euros and demands a proportionate return of the first payment.
But the interesting thing is that in the summer Neymar and Barca almost agreed to return the "wretched" player to the back of Catalonia.
True, the deal went wrong, but the prospect of a reverse forward remains.
And as Sports.Ru reports, citing insiders, the club's lawyers told the player's representatives that if the issue of financial claims is not settled in a pre-trial manner, it will rule out the possibility of the Brazilian returning.
Neymar himself is so eager to return that he asks for guarantees that the Catalans will buy him back.

Laar replied that the Reform Party's goal was to win two seats on the board of the Bank of Estonia - so that in addition to Janus Tamkivi, Andres Sutt would join the board.

Russian Foreign Ministry commented on the scandal in Kyrgyzstan with the show of Malachov

In August, the Belarusian leader advised local sugar processors to find new markets for the sale of products.

How to increase your future pension and not recycle it
Not only the Russian Federation's Pension Fund, but also non-state pension funds are able to pay pensions.
The NPF is a private company, reports "Volgorodska pravda.ru".
They work like a contribution: you make contributions, the fund invests them and eventually returns you the money with interest.
If you are interested in this method, first read the information about the NPF on the Bank of Russia website.
All funds operate under the same rules as established by federal law.
Pension bills can be bought by law.
The number of points you are missing depends on how many years of experience you are missing to calculate your pension.
This method is suitable for those who worked informally.
You can also make a contribution for a relative, for example a housewife.
Recommendation for those who are considering retirement at the beginning of their career.
Increased pension payments are paid to public servants, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers and people who have worked for a certain number of years in the Far North.
If you want to avoid being denied anything when you reach retirement age, take care of it in advance.
Buy real estate, currency, securities, put money away for deposits.
Most importantly, keep your financial literacy up.
Media representatives visited the fourth energy block of the CHAES
A video recorded at the fourth power unit of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant was first posted on YouTube by Ruptly.
It is noted that a group of 15 media representatives gained access to the fourth reactor control room of the CHEA as part of the presentation of the guide to the alienation zone.
According to RT, the journalists were there in special protective suits for less than five minutes, as the ruins of the power plant destroyed by the explosion still emit 40,000 times more radiation than normal.

Football player Pavel Mamayev, released last week from the UDO colony, will not return to the Krasnodar football club.
The former half-back of this club may sign a contract with FC "Rostov" in the near future, - reports the portal "Championship".
According to the publication, the negotiations between the representatives of "Rostov" and Mamayev are now in the final stage.
The 31-year-old is expected to sign a two-year contract with an option to extend for one more season.
Sport-Express reports that one day earlier, Mamayev was due to undergo medical examination at the Moscow Dynamo, but the check-up did not take place due to "an uncertain situation in the club".
Krasnodar terminated the contract with Mamayev last week by mutual agreement.
The midfielder has played for the Krasnodar club since 2014.
With the team he won the bronze medal of the Russian championship twice.
Previously, Mamayev played for the Moscow Torpedo and the CSKA.
From 2009 to 2016, Mamayev played for the Russian national team, playing 15 matches in its lineup.

A samurai man with a sword tried to defend a cart found in a garbage can.
A resident of the American city of Oakland Park, Florida, is arrested on charges of attempted murder after he swung a samurai sword at his opponent in a dispute over a trash cart found in the garbage.
54-year-old Curtis Miller was digging in a garbage can near an empty house.
That's what Todd Beavers said.
The last one decided to join the search and found a black cart among the garbage.
Miller saw Beavers' find and was upset.
He thought he could claim the wagon, since he was the first to dig in the garbage.
The men started arguing.
Suddenly Beavers grabbed a cart and ran with it to his house.
Then Miller took the Samurai sword he found in the same pile and went after the opponent.
He caught up with Beavers near his house.
Miller pulled the sword out of the knife and began waving it toward the carriage kidnapper.
Beavers told Miller that the incident was being recorded on video.
When he saw the video camera, Miller ran away, but threatened to return.
Beavers left the cart in the yard and went into the house.
Soon afterward, he saw a stranger enter his yard and take away his wagon, shouting insults.
The police are already looking for Miller for driving without a license.
A man has been arrested, charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the American city of Hardiston, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager attacked a stranger and wounded her with a sword.
He responded by saying that guests at the wedding that he stayed at did not let him smoke.
Mass riots on three
The Moscow case against the participants of the summer protests is further apart and loses political relevance.
The evidence of the "mass riots" itself is untenable, but without a political solution to put the case on hold, the weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the charges being dropped.
The case should inspire the public, but it will surely anger law enforcement officials whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence have been in vain.
On Thursday, September 26, one of the three remaining defendants under Article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass riots) - Alexey Minayilo - was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligations, and a few hours later was fully rehabilitated: the SCR dropped the charges against him.
Minayilo spent almost two months in prison, and several professional societies joined him: historians, priests, and writers.
After that, only two accused of participating in mass riots remained in the case (originally 13 accused): Sergei Fomin, who was transferred to house arrest on September 3, and Samriddin Rajabov, who was arrested by the court the day before and was also accused of using violence against a representative of the government, article 318 of the Criminal Code.
The court sentenced the author of a joke petition about Latvia joining the United States
The court of the Visemont Suburbs of Riga has sentenced the author of a humorous petition to join Latvia to the United States of America, Denis Bartecki.
The man was given 80 hours of correctional work and one year of probation.
"Sensity is not the strongest part of our system", Baretzsky said.
He also added that the punishment is usually less than what is requested.
The signing of Latvia to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, at the same time as this petition, the site was gathering signatures on Latvia's accession to the "Galactic Empire" and on the country's exit from the Solar System and the Milky Way.
It is noted that Bartecki was charged with a criminal offence under the first paragraph of Article 82 of the Criminal Law of the country - "Public Call to Undermine the Territorial Integrity of the Republic of Latvia".
Before that, in 2016, the author of the internet petition to join Latvia in Russia received six months in prison.
A Japanese airliner made an emergency landing in Khabarovsk

The plane, owned by the Japanese company ANA, was carrying 206 people, including 12 crew members.
No injuries were reported.
There's another plane that flew in for the people from Tokyo.

Russian Interior Ministry proposes to punish for insulting police on the Internet
The Russian Interior Ministry has prepared amendments to the Law "On Police" to protect law enforcement officers from spreading defamatory and defamatory information on the Internet.
On Friday, the Federal portal of normative legal acts published an application for public discussion of the bill, the draft document itself has not yet been published.
The explanatory note to the document states that it is being developed in connection with the need to protect the honor and dignity of a police officer from "dissemination in information and communication networks, including the Internet, of information of a defamatory nature, including discrediting nature".
The exact way police officers are supposed to be protected from online slander is not clear.
The document explains that the amendments will be applied "by individualizing the mechanism" already provided for by the law on blocking posts that insult officials and the law on fines for such posts.
Both laws went into effect in March of this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after public discussion and independent anti-corruption scrutiny.
According to the explanatory note, the amendments to the law "On Police" should come into force in January 2020.
On March 18, President Vladimir Putin signed a law on punishment for "obvious disrespect to the state" on the Internet.
According to this document, Roskomnadzor warns the resource about the violation and gives him a day to eliminate it.
The first violation of the prohibitions is punishable by a fine of 30 to 300 thousand rubles, and the second violation by 15 days' administrative arrest.
On April 12, Roskomnadzor first applied this rule to the media, blocking the Yaroslavl edition of 76.ru.
Shortly afterwards, the Chudowsky District Court of the Novgorod region fined the local resident 30 thousand rubles for posting "two records with information in inappropriate form that insult human dignity and public morality and express manifest disrespect to society, the state, the authorities exercising state power in the Russian Federation".

Housing loans in Russia will be reduced until the end of 2019.
This was announced by the director general of the credit organization "Dom.rf" Alexander Plutnik, reports "Interfax".
Plutnik said that most banks will continue to reduce mortgage rates for the remaining months of the year, and the average rate will reach 8.9 percent - the level set by the national project "Housing and urban environment".

The program provides for "providing affordable housing for middle-income families, including creating opportunities for them to purchase (build housing using a mortgage loan, the rate of which should be less than 8 percent)".
Earlier in September, it was reported that one of the biggest players in the Russian mortgage market - Sberbank - plans to reduce the mortgage rate by the end of 2019.
Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help you to stay young?
The subject of phytoandrogens is poorly studied.
The most famous is pine dust.
But phytoestrogens have been studied well and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain age-related diseases (including cardiovascular disease, some cancers).
Famous sources of phytoestrogens are all beans (the most popular being soybeans), hops, flaxseeds.
However, many experts believe that such BADs cannot be a complete replacement for natural hormones.
The potential harm of such supplements cannot be excluded.
For example, taking them can reduce the production of your own hormones because you get too many external analogues.
Veretnikov called for the revival of the Kazakh "Jenis".
Former Russian and Russian national team striker Oleg Veretnikov joined the action to revive the Kazakh "Jenis".
The Astana club, which in different years was called "Dynamo", "Celinnik", "Astana" and "Jenis", was disbanded in 2014.
Veretnikov defended his colors in 2004 and 2008.
"Heard about the revival of the football club "Jenis" organized by its fans.
I couldn't stay away!
I spent a season and a half at this club.
It wasn't the best of times in terms of results and funding, but I will never forget this club and its loyal fans who have always been with the team!
The stadium named after Muntapov, where I scored my 200th career goal, will be remembered forever!
The genis must be reborn!
He's got a great history and a great fan base.
I wish them all the best and I believe that the city authorities will return their home club!" - Veretennikov wrote on Instagram.

The Defense Ministry launched a cruise missile for the first time from the "Bastion" complex at Chukotka.
The Onix launched at a distance of 350 kilometers from the target, and 200 of them flew over land, which is a record for this type of missile.

The Bastion complexes were never used in Chucotka.
Hydrometeorological center named true folk symbols
There are many folk signs in Russia that people try to predict the weather using.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The hydrometric center checked all the signs that are supposed to work.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can be trusted, indeed, in a short time frame.
As the scientific director of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center, Roman Vilfand, said, if the sun is red at sunset, the next day will be really weathery, as our ancestors noted.
And if the sky's bright, it's going to rain the next day.
The second working sign is based on bird watching.
They're more often referred to as the sparrows, if they fly low, it's usually before the rain.
The explanation is simple: When the air is humid, mosquitoes wet their wings and their fins are forced to lower to hunt insects, reports TASS.
Different continents have their own folk traditions.
The Day of the Horse is a traditional folk holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on February 2.
It is believed that on this day, the calf emerges from its nest to determine the time of spring.
Unidentified oil spots discovered on the beaches of northeast Brazil
Oil spots of unknown origin have been found on 99 beaches in northeastern Brazil.
The contamination sites were scattered over 2,000 kilometers of the coastline.
The first reports of oil spots were discovered on September 2.
However, every day until Thursday, their numbers, as well as the territorial coverage, continued to increase.
The Brazilian Environment Institute conducted a chemical analysis of the samples.
It turns out they're all identical, and it's crude oil.
The state oil corporation Petrobras, which was given the samples to analyze, said that they did not match the oil extracted from the Brazilian fields.
"It's a thick oil.
It can be dropped off one of the ships after the tanks are cleared.
Many continue to do so.
And it probably got into the ocean", said Rosario Almeida, coordinator of the oil workers' union of Pernambuco and Paraíba states, to the Brazilian news portal G1.
He also added that despite the ban, many ships continue to dump waste in the open sea.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states in the northeast, environmentalists have discovered nine sea turtles completely covered in oil.
And only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environment Institute, together with Petrobras, will begin cleaning up polluted beaches.
Meanwhile, the institute's experts recommend that tourists and locals avoid the oil spots and alert them to any contamination sites found.

Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev instructed the Rospotrebnadzor, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Trade, together with the business ombudsman and the business community, to review sanitary and epidemiological rules and norms for the general nutrition organizations.
They will also have to examine the transition to the application of the requirements set out in the technical regulations of the Eurasian Economic Union.
The ministry should submit its proposals to the government no later than October 15, according to the list of instructions of Mr. Medvedev on the results of the "Dialogue" program on the Russian channel "Russia 24" on September 11.
Mr. Medvedev also instructed all the mentioned agencies, besides the Ministry of Justice, to submit proposals to conduct an experiment on limiting control activities for general nutrition organizations in a number of regions, including Moscow, Tatarstan and Kaliningrad region, from 1 January 2020.
The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Economy have been instructed to submit a bill to the government with amendments to the CoAP on the application of administrative suspension of activities for violation of requirements to the organization of food, which caused harm to health.
In addition, the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs and the Ministry of Finance should work on the question of gradual transition from 2021 to the formation of a consumer basket based on a basic set of products that allows for the formation of a full-fledged diet of healthy food.
Recall that the business community spoke about the outdated standards after one of the Andersson cafes was closed.
The business community demanded the cancellation of existing SanPines, and Rospotrebnadzor announced the joint development of new ones.
There are 33 departments on the list.
Meanwhile, Rospotrebnadzor intends to reduce the number of sanitary norms and regulations by 40 times by 2021.
Now the operatives have information about three thefts that the prisoner is involved in.
A man in the Skuratsk neighborhood of Tula.
He stole the batteries and the auto magnets from the cars.
The kidnapper stole the battery from two cars - VAZ-2106 and VAZ-2107 - presumably for further sale.
"And from another vehicle VAZ-2107 with the same purpose, the assailant took the auto magnet and the subwoofer", - said the UMVD in the Tulsa region.
The framed assailant was probably planning to sell.
Currently, a 26-year-old unemployed man is being held.
Russians have nothing to save for retirement - V. Matviyenko
The speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko believes that the Russians do not have enough savings to fully implement the legislation on a guaranteed pension product.
The practice of increasing pensions by personal savings is quite common in the world.
It's another matter of how timely we have it.
"In my opinion, a significant part of the population now has income, which they simply have nothing to allocate for increasing pension provision in the future", said V. Matviyenko.
The Russian people, according to the speaker, cannot understand the mechanisms of forming and calculating pensions, because "the constant changes in this sphere have completely confused them".
That doesn't mean I'm against improving the pension system, regulating its legislation.
"Russia is a social state, and we must do everything to improve pensions, social security.
But the steps in this direction should be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account the domestic realities", - said V. Matvienko.
The head of the SF stressed that if this initiative (the bill on guaranteed pension products) is to be developed, then several basic principles must be provided for, including voluntary, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and the responsibility of the state to ensure the preservation of pension accumulation.
The Russian Federation's Finance Ministry announced on 6 September that a draft law on guaranteed pension products (GPP) has been sent for approval .
Among its main elements are the voluntary procedure for accessing citizens to the accumulation system, ensuring that long-term pension accumulation of citizens is preserved by the state, the registration of accumulation accounts of citizens by the central administrator, tax benefits for business and tax deductions for citizens.

Sony and Disney have reached an agreement.
Image caption News of the departure of the beloved Marvel superhero has angered many dedicated fans
One of the most famous comic book characters, Spider-Man, will remain in the Marvel universe.
Disney and Sony Pictures have managed to negotiate the rights to use it in the franchise films.
This was revealed in a Sony press release, which said that the third part of Spider-Man starring Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.
Earlier, it was reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not reach a consensus on revenue sharing, causing Spider-Man to leave the Marvel universe.
Sony owns the rights to the film hero.
She rented them out to Marvel movies, which is owned by Disney.
As a result, Sony earned revenue from box office receipts, and Disney earned revenue from souvenirs and toys.
At some point, Disney reportedly stopped agreeing to this arrangement, and the company wanted to revise the agreement.
Marvel Studios president Kevin Faighi has said he's excited.
It's amazing that Spiders' journey through the Marvel Cinematic Universe will continue.
"We're all very excited at Marvel Studios to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is a symbolic figure.
He is a hero whose story touches all generations and audiences around the world", the statement said.
At the same time, Faigi reminded us that Sony is also building its own movie universe, built around Spider-Man.
"So it turns out he's the only superhero to have been in different movie theaters.
So while Sony continues to develop its own SpyDys universe, the future may present unexpected surprises", he noted.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted an excerpt from the film "Wolf from Wall Street" on his Instagram account, in which the character Leonardo DiCaprio shouts "I'm not leaving!"
The company's discontent was reported in August.
According to the media, Disney wanted to get half of the box office revenue from Spider-Man movies provided that both companies would pay half of the cost of producing the films.
But Sony didn't like it.
The news of the possible departure of a beloved Marvel superhero has angered many dedicated fans.
Details of the new terms are yet to be released.
According to CNBC, Sony declined to comment on the deal, but said: "We have been working together for the past four years and our shared desire to continue working together has been in line with the wishes of many fans [of Spider-Man].
We are happy to be able to move forward together".
Avengers: The Final, which brought together Spider-Man, Thor, Hulk, and other Marvel superheroes, became the highest-grossing film in world cinema history, moving Avatar from first place.

Oleg Vinnik has been caught in the base of the Peacekeeper: what happened
Popular Ukrainian singer Oleg Vinnik, who starred in the project #AllMire with Russian stars who supported the Kremlin's policies toward Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea, was inducted into the Peace Makers' base.
The news was posted on the official database.

Recall, there's been a wave of outrage on the Internet.
The video itself is called a mockery.
How can artists who have visited the occupied Crimea and supported Putin's policies that have sparked the war in Donbass, where people are dying almost every day, talk about peace?

The damage from each of the thefts amounted to three to 21 thousand rubles.
The criminals carried ovens, refrigerators, curtains, buckets, gas cylinders, chairs, tubs, and many other items.
They were stopped by a security alarm in the last house.
The defendants were found guilty of theft, which was committed by a group of persons who had entered the home illegally and caused significant damage by a previous conspiracy.

We lost the fight in the spectacle, - said Emelyanenko in an interview with "SE".
Looking at no one.
So I came up with a new kind of mixed martial arts, Universal World Fight.
Rules are three different rounds.
MMA is a sport that brings together all the martial arts.
A mixed martial artist must be able to do everything - both stand up and fight and work in the outdoors.
First round, just the punching gear in the stand.
The second round is a fight only, with the time to host the parlor being limited to 30 seconds.
Third round, all clear.
When's the first tournament under the rules you've come up with?
It's the 29th of November.
In the undercard of our fight with Kokleyev.
But it's not clear exactly how many fights there will be.

Trade with Russia is not just about tanks .
Trade between Russia and India can double due to the geopolitical situation.
This was announced at the V anniversary forum of small and medium-sized businesses of the SCO and BRICS member countries, by Deputy Director of the Confederation of Indian Industry Manish Kumar.
It is important for us to learn from the SCO and BRICS countries, including Russia, - stressed the guest from Delhi.
- Our confederation has 9,000 direct members and 300,000 partner companies from 130 countries.
All of these are small and medium-sized businesses that are working with the Shanghai Organization.
And we're not standing still, we're evolving, and all these sanctions against Russia and the geopolitical situation in general are just helping us all grow.
Our bilateral trade now exceeds 10 billion US dollars, but we can double that.
First of all, it's the new technologies in healthcare, artificial intelligence and robotics.
Our trade is not just tanks and heavy industry.
According to Manish Kumar, India has already established its first contacts with modern Russian centers.
For example, a delegation from Delhi and other cities recently visited Skolko and Innapolis.
We signed a memorandum to create systems that would allow us to build our modern business.
Entrepreneurship is not a greed, it's a necessity.
We need a step towards economic prosperity.
We need to expand, to attract small and medium-sized businesses, and together with Russia, China and other countries, we will definitely do it", the Indian industrialist stressed.

New artesian wells have been built on the site.
They built pump stations over them.
The water treatment and disinfection facilities have been reconstructed.
As a result, the Sokolsk water catchment will provide the Tobolyak with quality drinking water.

Then Tobolsk will be able to fully switch to underground water supplies.
Water purification facilities expanded in Vague
In Congress, Trump's conversation with Zelensky saw a "Russian trail"

Rospotrebenzorg is strongly against bringing cigarettes back to airports
The Rospotrebnadzor is strongly opposed to returning cigarettes to airports.
"Neither ventilation nor filters, even combined, can reduce the exposure to tobacco smoke to levels that are considered acceptable", the report says.

The expert said why you should stop drinking tea in bags.
A team of scientists from McGill University in Canada found that when a tea bag is cooked in a cup, over ten billion microplastic particles are absorbed in five minutes.
The packaged drink can also be made with oatmeal, said food safety expert Elizabeth Tikhonova.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot get reliable information about the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer can add ingredients that will not be indicated on the packaging.
The oats aren't thrown out at the end of the season, so they could end up in the tea.
"Moreover, tea plants are not always included in the packages", said Tikhonova.
She said it's best to avoid drinking this drink in favor of the tea on the weasel, which is sold in specialty stores.
She also stressed that the danger of packaged tea lies not only in its composition but also in the method of production - the micro-particles are heated to high temperatures, which can cause them to release harmful substances.
"It is best to buy pure green or black tea - this is the least added drink", the expert said.

Regions are offered to share business secrets
As the "Parliamentary Gazette" reported, on September 27, Chairman of the Federation Council's Committee on Economic Policy Andrei Kutepov sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and the Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov with a proposal to express his position on the initiatives of the Federation's subjects to improve legislation in the field of supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
Time to establish interregional connections
The Federal Council's Economic Policy Committee summarized the information received from the regions on the programs for business development and self-employment legalisation in the regions, as well as the results of such programs.
In their letters, the regions have told senators about the problems of SME development and have sent proposals to improve existing legislation.
"Today, communication between the regions is not well established, which has led to the fact that the business community in all regions of the visit of senators has been pointed out the lack of information about regional programs for the development of entrepreneurship in general", said Andrei Kutepov.
In the annex to the letter to the Government, he presented a summary of the positive findings of the regions on legalisation of self-employment and summary data from the regions with proposals and issues (available to the editorial board).
In addition to the relevant ministries, the aggregate data from the regions are also sent to the heads of regional executive authorities.
The exchange of information on the positive developments in the regions could give a boost to the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step to this exchange will be to forward the information available to the Economic Policy Committee", the senator told the Parliamentary Gazette.
Useful experience
Today, many regions of the country have adopted and successfully implemented programmes to support small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, in the Volodog region there is a Centre for Supporting Entrepreneurship, which, in addition to financial support measures, helps businessmen in the certification of finished products.
In the Ivanovo region, a business support system has been developed, which envisages the implementation of the principle of one window through multifunctional centers.

The Orlovsk region has a cluster development center.
Amur region within the framework of the federal project "Acceleration of small and medium-sized enterprises" provides the possibility of subsidizing business incubators created on the basis of existing non-state coworking centers, at the expense of federal budget funds.
In a number of other regions, special support measures are being taken for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed people continue to be taken out of the shadows
According to the regional authorities, to more effectively support small and medium-sized businesses, a number of changes should be made to the current legislation.
For example, the Archangel region proposed replacing the term "self-employment" with "entrepreneurial activity", as it "coincides with the content of the state service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens".
In the Ivanovo region, it is necessary to introduce amendments that include expanding the list of activities of self-employed citizens, including activities for decorating and repairing residential premises, dacha buildings, physical training.
Bryan region considers it important to strengthen the control over unfair dairy producers through the veterinary system "Mercury".
In the Kostroma and Magadan regions, the concept of social entrepreneurship and the directions of support for social entrepreneurship are being advocated in the regulatory and legal field.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific legislation.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account when preparing state programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific law projects", - assured Andrei Kutepov.
Airlines helped passengers avoid neighbors with crying children
Japan Airlines (JAL) has launched a new feature: booking seats on the plane now allows you to find out where small children will be sitting.
Now, if you want to live next door to them, you can avoid them.
Passengers of Japan Airlines (JAL) were given the opportunity to take advantage of the new option and avoid unwanted neighbourhood with young children.
The carrier has launched a feature that lets you track where the kids are sitting.
When choosing seats in the cabin, passengers can see the child's head in the seats occupied by children from eight days to two years old.
Thus, those who do not want to fly around babies because of the possible inconvenience of crying can move as far away from them as possible.
Internet users who use the airline's services have been delighted by the innovation.
Some of them thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One user complained that a few weeks ago he was flying from New York to Doha, and there were three crying children sitting next to him.
Another commentator suggested that "adult flights only" be introduced, expressing willingness to pay more for such flights.
Many tourists have said that they will now try to always choose Japan Airlines for their travels, as they see nothing pleasant about flying around a crying baby in a closed space.
A woman who was traveling with her baby had tried to cheer up the passengers on the Seoul-San Francisco flight.
She prepared bags of candy for each of the 200 passengers, each containing an apology note.

Pavel Ustinov joined the protests in support of the Moscow affairs
Actor Pavel Ustinov joined the series of "Freedom for all" single picketing, which are held on Friday at the building of the administration of the president of the Russian Federation in Moscow's Old Square, reports the correspondent of "Interfax".
The series of protests began on September 18 in support of Ustinov himself and has continued every day since.
At present, the participants of the action, alternating with each other, stand holding a poster with the inscription "Freedom to all" and the names of those convicted and arrested after the unsanctioned rallies in Moscow in the summer of 2019.
In addition to Ustinov, the names of Yegor Zhukov, Kirill Zhukov, Daniel Begletz, Yevgeny Kovalenko, Konstantin Kotov, Ivan Podkopayev, Ayder Gubeydulin, Alexei Minayilo, Sergei Fomin, Samriddin Rajabov, Nikita Churchov, Eduard Malyshevsky, and Vladislav Sinitsa are also on the poster.
The Tver court of Moscow sentenced 24-year-old Ustinov to 3.5 years in a colony of general regime on charges of using violence against a Russian soldier of the Russian Revolutionary Guard during an unsanctioned action on August 3 in the center of Moscow (Article 2 of Article 318 of the Russian Criminal Code).
On September 20, the court changed the restraining order against Ustinov from detention to a non-retirement order.

Supplies of "sanctions" to Russia fell 100 times
The Russian government estimates that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo has decreased more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31 thousand tons of products were imported from the sanctioned countries, compared with 3 million 442,2 thousand tons for the same period in 2013, reports "Interfax".
At the same time, the value of imported products decreased to $226.5 million from $4 billion 975.5 million respectively.
It's about the supply of goods that haven't been under embargo.
The report states that the volume of prohibited products was compensated by increased imports from the CIS, Africa, Southeast Asia, Serbia.
Recall that at the end of August, the government extended the deadline of the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and foodstuffs, which are prohibited from being imported into Russia as part of counter-sanctions, until December 31, 2020.
The document, which was posted on the official legal information portal, noted that the validity of the rules was extended for another year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
Initially, the sanctions were imposed on products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, on August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and on January 1, 2016, Ukraine joined the list.
The order signed by Putin to eliminate illegal sanctions (food products that were subject to a food embargo imposed by Moscow in response to Western sanctions against Russia) came into force in 2015.
In turn, the government has authorized the destruction of "sanctioned" food by any legal means.
As the West maintained its sanctions, Russia also extended its response.
The measure does not apply to products that citizens import for personal use.
The ban does not apply to the import of goods weighing up to 5 kilograms for personal consumption.
However, the head of the Council under the President of the Russian Federation for the development of civil society and human rights, Mikhail Fedotov, has previously called the destruction of food products "simply immoral", and this, according to him, has a negative impact on the education of people.
Moreover, in early June, the Rospotrebnadzor took the initiative to ban the destruction of foodstuffs suitable for consumption.
After that, the Council on Human Rights under the President of the Russian Federation gave a similar recommendation to the government.
And Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexey Gordeev said that destroying food is wrong, and we need to think about how to use it for its purpose, evaluating the quality.

The school decided to call it New Look.
The project will be overseen by the Moscow State Institute of International Relations of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the Foundation for Economic Development of Higher Education.
The project is scheduled to begin next year.
They'll finish construction in late 2022, and start recruiting the first students the next year.
"The project envisages the creation of a public, non-commercial educational space, which will be based on the traditions of the classical Moscow school and experimental methods", - noted in the press service of Moscow Construction Investment.
In Chile started to build a telescope worth 1 billion euros
This is reported by TASS , with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
According to ESO, the construction of the dome of the building, which will house the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), is the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project yet.
The total cost is estimated by ESO to be over a billion euros.
Most of that money will be spent on equipment and building the observatory.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-breaking mirror, which will have a diameter of about 39 meters.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 meters.
This huge mirror, along with two auxiliary reflecting surfaces measuring 4.2 and 3.75 meters in diameter, will help E-ELT get the first detailed images of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and look for Earth's twins.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surroundings of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Although the construction of the dome is only just beginning, the mirrors, scientific tools and other components of the observatory have been in the works for three years - since the first plans for the construction of the E-ELT were announced.
The contract for the production of the head mirror, which has a total value of about 400 million euros, was awarded to the German firm SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
