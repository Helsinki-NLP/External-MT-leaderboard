Rapidly increasing cumulative outbreaks of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of the coronavirus (COVID-19) disease, similar trends in EU/EEA member states and the UK, suggest that although the outbreak is in different stages in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience gained from the disease in Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care wards need to increase their preparedness for the large wave of COVID-19 patients who will need therapeutic health services, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2020, a cluster of pneumonia patients with an unknown cause was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the cause of the disease, which is a new type of coronavirus, will henceforth be referred to as acute acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2.
Since then, the discomfort caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been called the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The available data to date indicate that approximately 80% of COVID-19 infected vertebrae develop mild respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most of these vertebrae recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 became so severe that patients were hospitalized, while the remaining 6% of patients with severe disease were placed in intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is around 4%.
In this study, we assessed the trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence in each of the EU/EEA countries and the UK and compared the trends in China's Hubei Province.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with those in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 infections in EU/EEA member states and the UK
Subsequently, COVID-19 spread to more geographic areas in China, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are now following the same trend in this country.
On 11 March, the Secretary General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a COVID-19 pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 edition of the journal Eurosurveillance, Spiteri and colleagues reported the first definitive European case of coronavirus according to the WHO definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first confirmed cases were reported on 24 January 2020 by France among travellers returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and the end of the reporting period, with Italy alone having 1,7750 cases and 1,441 deaths.
Collective counting and collective outbreak of COVID-19 patients
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the statistics of confirmed COVID-19 cases in each country of the world are received daily from official sources such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities in those countries and the World Health Organization and are updated at 8:00 a.m.
The data was used to assess COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK and compare them to Italy.
As a basis for determining the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated a shortened 14-day cumulative incidence period for COVID-19 patients, so the normal COVID-19 time period, in each EU/EEA Member State and the UK, was considered for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The cumulative number of cases per country was also compared at 8:00 am on 15 March 2020 with the number from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 infection trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trends observed in the shortened 14-day cumulative outbreak of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK were broadly consistent with those in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
Overall, in the EU/EEA Member States and the UK, cumulative COVID-19 outbreaks began around 21 February and then accelerated around 28 February 2020 (content attached).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA Member States and the UK also showed similar increases in cumulative COVID-19 incidence (request attached).
Figure 2 shows a comparison of the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with those in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
It explained that by 8:00 am on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA member states and the UK reported total cases, comparable to Italy's figures in the previous 3 weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of definitive COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA member states and the UK is increasing rapidly.
The observed trends in the cumulative COVID-19 outbreak suggest that the pandemic is spreading at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries experience different stages of the outbreak, there are differences in the responses of national public health authorities, and different criteria apply in different countries for people who need to undergo a confirmatory or complementary COVID-19 test.
In early March 2020, doctors in the Italian regions reported a situation where around 10% of COVID-19 patients were in need of intensive care, and media sources reported that the maximum capacity of hospitals and intensive care wards in these areas had already been filled.
Currently, data on hospitalization and/or intensive care for COVID-19 patients are available in only 6% and 1% of EU/EEA Member States, respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be collected in a systematic manner to complement existing surveillance data and focus on a number of reported cases and deaths.
A 2010-11 survey found wide variations in access to intensive care and mediocre care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 population in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that these countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care beds per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010).
Modelling scenarios related to health and treatment capacity saturation were presented with estimates for each EU/EEA Member State and the UK for the prevalence of COVID-19 patients admitted with a risk of >90% exceeding ICU capacity in the sixth ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment for COVID-19.
As infected vertebrae have been observed in clusters in certain regions in EU/EEA Member States and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve a regional population, information on infected vertebrae and intensive care beds should be provided preferably in accordance with the Territorial Unit Procedure for Statistical Level 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of the disease in Italy and current trends in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA Member States and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care wards should therefore prepare for the continuous mass transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and make the necessary arrangements to receive COVID-19 patients, especially in intensive care, just as happened in the Italian regions.
As stated in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, it is necessary to shift the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach, with a shift from restrictions to epidemic mitigation, as the expected rapid increase in infections may not give decision-making institutions and hospitals sufficient opportunity to identify, accept and implement appropriate responses if appropriate measures are not taken in advance.
The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic.
Countries have a short window of time to strengthen their control efforts and reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and thus reduce the pressure on healthcare systems.
If this fails, it is likely that healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a massive wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by SARS-CoV-2 (SARS), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and sickened more than 80,000 people in China and around the world, leading to a humanitarian catastrophe.
SARS-CoV-2 may also have been transmitted by bats, similar to its homologue SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, and may have caused similar symptoms by the same mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and lethal than SARS, but is more contagious and infects older people and men more than young people and women.
In response to the growing number of publications related to this emerging disease, this response seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this highly regarded research topic.
We will provide basic information on epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of disease.
Although many questions remain unanswered, this review study is expected to provide insight into the recognition and eradication of this dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020, became an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were asked to stay home throughout the holidays and for many weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has a high affinity for the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) chose the name SARS-CoV-2 for it and the related disease name, CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19) (coronavirus disease-19 or COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to about five other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has led to more than 80,000 confirmed cases, with more than 40,000 discharges and more than 3,000 deaths.
The World Health Organization has warned that COVID-19 is "public enemy No. 1", and its power is likely to be greater than terrorism.
According to the PubMed database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles have been published on COVID-19, covering topics including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first article on determining the genomic sequence of virus samples from several patients was reported on January 7, 2020.
This review aims to summarize research advances in new and relevant areas.
In the possible sections, we will try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and another coronavirus disease called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, which became prevalent in 2012).
We will discuss what we have learned so far about disease prevention and diagnosis, as well as a number of critical questions that remain.
Coronavirus have traditionally been non-lethal pathogens to humans, causing about 15% of common colds.
However, in the last century, we have twice encountered highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the first outbreak in 2003 in China and 2012 in Saudi Arabia, respectively, and spread to other countries in a short time, causing a terrible epidemic of disease and death.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third coronavirus outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1, pneumonia clusters of unknown origin were first reported to the National Health Commission of China from Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the coronavirus outbreak was confirmed.
On 15 January 2020, the first case of Futi was reported from Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, other provinces, and countries.
On 20 January, infections were reported to healthcare workers, suggesting human-to-human transmission of the virus was also possible.
On 23 January, Wuhan was placed under a complete quarantine and public transportation was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study of the disease reported that of 40 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, where the disease is believed to have originated from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
As of this writing, the disease has spread throughout China and approximately 50 other countries worldwide.
As the situation is changing rapidly, the extent and ultimate severity of the outbreak must be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-center collaborative study of 8,866 coronavirus patients including 4,021 definite COVID-19 patients provided the following evidence of a more recent outbreak (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, but primarily those aged 65-30.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected patients were over 50 years of age, a very small number were under 20 years of age, and only 14 infected individuals were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infects men (0.31 per 100,000) more often than women (0.27 per 100,000).
COVID-19 spread in clusters in Hubei and its surroundings.
Diagnosis of COVID-19 took an average of 5 days (9-2 days) from the time of onset.
The average duration of the commons (7.2-3.0) is 4.8 days.
The average time from onset to death (13 - 4.8) was 9.5 days.
The base multiplication rate (R<sub>0</sub>) was 3.77 (with approximate confidence: 4.05-3.51) and the modified R<sub>0</sub> was 4.82-2.23.
The number of infected spine increased significantly before 23 January 2020, coinciding with the increase in travel volume before the Spring Festival in China.
The confirmed mortality rate was 1.44% (approximately 95% confidence: 1.86-1.10) and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (approximately 95% confidence: 4.59-2.02).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (60 years or older), and severe pneumonia.
Co-infections are a subfamily of large, coated viruses that contain a single strand of RNA.
They are classified into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, among which the alpha and beta coronavirus infects humans.
The spike glycoprotein (S) coating of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses binds to their own cellular receptors called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) respectively, and fuses with the cell membrane.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after viral genome replication, the genomic RNA, along with a coating of glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, forms virion-containing vesicles that then fuse with the plasma membrane, leading to the release of the new virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
The findings showed that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta coronavirus with 99.98% similarity in 10 samples from the original outbreak site at the Hunan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through examination with a translucent electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the superfine sections of the epithelium of the human airways.
Human ACE2 is known as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and also SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a weaker binding to the human ACE2 receptor than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a weaker disease than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 also produces a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secretory protein encoded by orf8.
The SARS-CoV-2 protein orf3b plays a role in the pathogenesis of the virus and inhibits the expression of IFNβ (interferon beta); however, orf8 does not contain any known dopamine or functional motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou and colleagues reported the cryomicroscopic structure of the human ACE2 receptor with a resolution of 2.9 angstroms in complex with an amino acid carrier called B0AT1.
They found that the above complex, which has both open and closed configurations, is assembled into a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind to two S proteins, which can be used as a benchmark for coronavirus detection and transmission.
B0AT1 may be converted into a therapeutic target for drug screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate host
It has been found that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV both originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through cats, zebras and camels, respectively.
By comparing the phylogenetics of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were identified as the primary hosts of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like coronaviruses from bats, bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, which mediating hosts have helped the virus cross the species boundary and infect humans is unknown and the route of transmission must be clearly identified.
Jay and colleagues suggested that snakes were carriers of the virus from bats to humans by means of a homologous neutrophil translocation within protein S.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins - long-horned ant mammals  often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are possible intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 based on genetic similarity to a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still a large difference; therefore, it is expected that definitive results will be provided for consistent evidence (Figure 3).
The physical-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in in-vitro conditions for 48 hours in a dry environment, ranging from 5 days at a temperature of less than 20 °C and a humidity of 50-40%.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be susceptible to the following agents that can effectively inactivate the virus: UV rays and exposure to 56°C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant solution, plasticizing acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but chlorhexidine does not have this ability.
Overall, all human populations are immune to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 has not been accurately reported in any studies.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
The general pattern of the virus after attacking the host is first detected by the host's innate immune system via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including the -C-type quasi-lectin receptors, the quasi-transitory receptor (TLR), the quasi-NOD receptor (NLR), and the quasi-RIG-I receptor (RLR).
The virus induces various pathways of function such as expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of viral antigens by macrophages.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV may help the virus survive immune system responses.
An adaptive immune response will soon be in place to combat the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to activate specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the infected cells.
Helper T cells produce inflammatory cytokines to help the cells defend.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit T cell functions by inducing apoptosis.
Immunity includes complementary cells including C3a and C5a, and antibodies also play a role in fighting viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system produces large volumes of localized free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case, lead to multi-organ failure and even death.
The risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, which is a cluster outbreak of its characteristics, is higher in elderly people with concomitant diseases and pregnant women.
It is normal for people who have been exposed to a high number of viruses or people whose immune functions are impaired to have a higher chance of infection than others.
The average duration of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is approximately 1 to 14 days, with a study of 425 initial patients in Wuhan showing that the duration is mostly 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 patients showed a median duration of comon of 3 days and a total of 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study mentioned above, based on a demographic review of 8,866 patients, cited a common duration of 4.8 (7.2-3.0) days.
It is important for health authorities to apply effective quarantine time based on the most accurate period of time to prevent transmission of the virus to others by infected but asymptomatic individuals.
As a general procedure, people who are found to be infected or infected with the virus should be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be increased to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary symptom of COVID-19 that may occur alone or be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, diarrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients developed shortness of breath and/or tissue oxygenation a week after onset of disease.
In severe cases, symptoms of acute respiratory syndrome, infectious shock, metabolic acidosis, and blood clotting disorder were observed in patients.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory and acute fever symptoms, even if there are no abnormalities in the swallowing imaging, should be screened for rapid detection of virus infection.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed the following percentage of symptoms observed in patients: 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% shortness of breath and 3% diarrhea; 8% of patients required auxiliary ventilation.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies on a family cluster and a cluster formed by transmission through asymptomatic individuals.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) as the main symptoms of the disease.
However, 80% of them required respiratory support, which was much higher than in COVID-19 patients and corresponded to a higher mortality rate for MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and heartburn (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, the main symptoms were fever (99-100%), dry cough (29-75%), shortness of breath (40-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%), and about 14%-20% of patients required assisted breathing.
As of 14 February, when confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576, the global COVID-19 mortality rate was 2%.
For comparison, the SARS mortality rate as of November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed patients.
In relation to MERS, according to a demographic study in June 2012, the mortality rate was 37% of 2,494 patients.
An earlier study reported that the <i>R</i><i><sub>0</i></sub> of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 long with a confidence interval (CI) of 7.23-5.71, while the <i>R0</i> of SARS-CoV-2 was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in relation to symptoms, mortality and <i>R</i><i><sub>0</i></sub> is presented in Table 1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher potential for transmission compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate is lower than the latter two.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 virus epidemic is much more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Clusters often start within a family or community or a single vehicle such as a pleasure boat.
Patients often have a history of travel or stay in Wuhan or other infected areas or have been in contact with infected people or patients within a two-week period prior to the onset of the disease.
However, it has been reported that people can have the virus for more than two weeks without showing any symptoms, and it is possible that recovered patients discharged from hospital may have virus spots in their body, leading to warnings to extend the quarantine period.
In the early stages, the number of ambient white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in patients is normal or reduced.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of less than 10<sup>9</sup>×4 cells per liter including lymphocyte count of less than 10<sup>9</sup>×1 cells per liter and increased concentrations of aminotransferase aspartate and viremia (viral observation in blood) were observed in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of hepato-muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood of some patients were elevated, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation in the blood of most patients were elevated.
In severely ill vertebrates, levels of D-dimer, a product of the breakdown of fibrin in the blood, were elevated and the number of lymphocytes was gradually reduced.
Abnormalities in chest X-rays are found in most COVID-19 patients and include symmetrical shadows of fragments or glass-like rounded curvatures in the lungs.
Patients often develop non-communicable pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis severely impair the exchange of respiratory gases.
Functional impairment of type 1 and type 2 lung pneumocytes reduces surfactant levels and, consequently, increases surface tension, which in turn reduces the ability of the lungs to dilate and increases the risk of lung collapse.
Thus, the most severe chest X-ray findings matched the most severe disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 identified the following symptoms: paralysis of lung pneumocytes, formation of transparent membranes, interstitial lymphocyte deposition, and observation of Chandastow sicilian sinuses in the lungs of patients who died of the disease; symptoms consistent with viral infection pathology and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and similar to those of SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to high false negative rates that may accelerate the epidemic, from 13 February 2020 in China began to use clinical manifestations for disease diagnosis (a diagnostic method that no longer relies solely on RT-PCR).
A similar situation existed with regard to the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and necessary for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang's team introduced the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus, in which pieces of SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA from <sup>18-</sup> 10 × 20 moles per liter to <sup>18-</sup> 10 × 200 moles per liter (100-10 copies per microlitre of input) are detected by a rod in less than an hour without the need for sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique, if confirmed in clinical samples, will improve sensitivity and relaxation.
Due to the lack of experience with the novel coronavirus, doctors are primarily providing supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while also attempting to use various therapeutic measures that were used or proposed for the treatment of previous outbreaks of coronavirus including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include psychiatric and potential therapies with antiviral drugs, immune system suppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychosocial support.
Even the use of recovered patients' plasma for the treatment of new patients has been suggested.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to produce antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks primarily the lungs and possibly to a lesser extent other ACE2 receptor-expressing organs such as the digestive system and the lungs.
However, respiratory failure is the main threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory aids are critical to relieving symptoms and saving patients' lives, and include conventional oxygen therapy, long oxygen circulation, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients suffering from severe respiratory symptoms should undergo extracranial membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified post-cardiac biotechnology that has previously been used to treat cardiac failure or fatal respiratory failure.
In addition, electrolyte balance maintenance, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and infectious shock, and protection of vital organ function are also of critical importance in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
It has been shown that cytokine storm in SARS and MERS patients is caused by an overreaction of the immune system.
Cytokine storm is a type of systemic inflammatory reaction characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune system cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which is the main cause of ARDS and various organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tosilezomab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive therapeutic approaches for cytokine storm include: T-cell-mediated immune response modulation; IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF inhibition; JAK inhibition; Blenatomib; cytokine-4 signaling inhibitors; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids as immunosuppressant drugs were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids have not been effective in treating severe lung damage in COVID-19 and SARS patients.
Instead, they may cause severe side effects, particularly osteoporosis caused by anemia, which significantly affects prognosis.
However, it is recommended that short-term treatment with low to moderate doses of corticosteroids be used with caution for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with critical conditions.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral drug has been confirmed.
However, intravenous injection of Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has been effective in a US patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead primarily to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, it was found that remdesivir may also have an inhibitory effect on other single-stranded RNA viruses including MERS and SARS viruses.
Accordingly, Gilead made the compound available to China for testing in two clinical trials on SARS-CoV-2 infected vertebrates, and the results were entirely as expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alpha, lupinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin were also used as potential drugs for the treatment of patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur following combination therapy with lupinavir/ritonavir.
Interactions between this medication and other medications used by the patient should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody production
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease for the purpose of treating other patients with the same disease or protecting healthy individuals from infection has a long history.
In fact, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies to fight the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign particles that identify and directly neutralize unique molecules in pathogens.
Based on this, plasma was collected from a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours and a reduction in inflammation, a reduction in viral load, and an improvement in oxygen saturation in their blood were observed.
However, the proposal for large-scale use of this method requires further validation and clarification before specific treatments are yet to be proposed.
In addition, alongside the therapeutic effects, the side effects associated with plasma therapy should also be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which may lead to a fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and a large plasma concentration is necessary to treat people with very severe disease.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies in a rapid time period to deal with global epidemics.
Therefore, isolating B cells from recovered patients and identifying genetic codes that code for effective antibodies or screening for effective antibodies against effective virus proteins is more critical and practical.
This can easily increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used for thousands of years to treat a wide range of ailments.
However, its effectiveness depends largely on the combination of several components of a formula that relies on diagnosing disease based on theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most of the active ingredients remain unknown or obscure because it is difficult to extract and validate these ingredients or their optimal compounds.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM (traditional Chinese medicine) is considered as one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for patients who have recovered from severe episodes.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest rates of treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces of China where traditional Chinese medicine was used for 87% of patients, including: Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province where traditional Chinese medicine was used for only about 30% of COVID-19 patients had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a very difficult comparison, as many other influencing factors such as the number and severity of patients must be taken into account in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) treatment alone with combination therapy of Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.
They found that the time it took to restore body temperature to optimal, alleviate symptoms, and be admitted to the Western Medicine+Traditional Chinese Medicine group was significantly shorter than the Western Medicine-only group.
Interestingly, the rate of symptomatic disease exacerbation (from mild to severe) for the WM+TCM (traditional Chinese medicine+western medicine) group was markedly lower than the Western medicine-only group (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the Western medicine+traditional medicine group was also lower than the Western medicine-only group (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine kamakan must be evaluated through more large-scale, clinically controlled trials.
Attempts to determine the mechanism of action and identifying the effective components of traditional Chinese medicine treatments, or where possible, a combination of them, are both interesting and tempting.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 often experience the horror of many highly contagious and even fatal diseases, and those in quarantine also experience fatigue, loneliness and anger.
In addition, infection symptoms including fever, oxygen deprivation and cough, as well as side effects of treatment options including corticosteroid-induced insomnia, anxiety and psychological distress, can occur.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychiatric conditions including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, motor psychosis, psychosomatic symptoms, psychosis, and even suicidal tendencies were reported.
Contact tracing and mandatory quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can cause stress and guilt in affected communities in relation to the impact of infection, quarantine, and social problems on families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be available to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons and those who have been in contact with them, as well as the general public who need these services.
Psychological support should include the formation of multi-speciality mental health teams, transparent information with regular and accurate news about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment programs, and the use of electronic devices and verbal apps to prevent close contact with others.
Effective vaccines are of critical importance for interrupting the chain of transmission from animal reservoirs and infected human vertebrae to sensitive hosts and are often considered complementary to antiviral therapy in controlling epidemics of emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to produce long-acting, strongly neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live dilute vaccines have been tested in animal models for SARS.
However, before a clinical study can begin, the in-vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in rats and dying models and their protection against xenozoic virus infection must be determined.
This is likely because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, isolated vertebrates and occasional clusters of Mers Kamakan are found in the Middle East and are spreading to other regions due to the persistence of the Xenozoic resources in indigenous areas.
Vaccination strategies using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, quasi-viral particles, and nucleotide protein subunits were developed for MERS and in some cases tested on animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for immunocompromised individuals is an emergency and critical to controlling the growing epidemic.
However, due to the long time required to design and produce a vaccine (average 18 months) and the dynamic mutations of coronavirus, addressing this problem is challenging.
As an emerging disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to exhibit its complementary clinical period in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually and without any subsequent complications.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with increased malaise and mortality in severely affected vertebrates.
Therefore, the design of a prognostic model for disease is critical for therapeutic health service organizations to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies conducted to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, as is COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurs mainly in the 65-30 age group, with 47.7% of people over 50 years of age infected in a study involving 8866 patients described above.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to suffer from seizures and background complications and were older than patients who did not need intensive care (with a median age of 66 versus 51 years), suggesting that age could be considered a predictor of outcome for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 infected men more than women (0.31 per 100,000 compared to 0.27 per 100,000).
Severe diseases and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to develop acute cardiac injury or arrhythmia.
Heart problems were also the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive clenbuterols, which may lead to hepatic impairment in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and disease have a strong correlation and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: Levels of reactive protein C in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and have been suggested as a potential diagnostic factor for disease, response to treatment, and eventual improvement.
It has been suggested that there is a correlation between CRP levels and severity and COVID-19 prognosis.
In addition, increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also be effective in predicting outcome.
These enzymes are highly expressed in several tissues, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are considered traditional markers for diagnosing cardiac or hepatic disorders.
Key clinical signs: Chest X-ray and timing of clinical signs, along with other relevant factors, should be considered to predict the consequences and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immune system suppressants that are commonly used as complementary therapy to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage in the fight against infectious diseases.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from anemia-related osteoporosis with long-term disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at lower doses and over a short period of time for COVID-19 patients.
Psychological stress: As explained above, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused many patients to experience excessive stress because they have often been forced to observe long periods of quarantine, have had a lot of doubts and suspicions about what is happening, and have witnessed the death of family members or close friends.
Providing psychological counseling and long-term support is essential to help these patients relieve stress and return to a normal life.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 has different epidemiological characteristics compared to SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 is able to multiply effectively in the upper respiratory tract in addition to the lower respiratory tract, similar to other common cold-causing coronaviruses, and may be present in the early phase of infection with mild or no symptoms.
Therefore, infected patients in the early or late stages can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, which can cause significant problems for epidemic control.
However, the findings suggest that SARS-CoV transmission occurred when patients were in the acute phase of the disease, so most transmissions did not occur in the early phase.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more dangerous and more difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
There are very good efforts underway in China, including complementary entry and exit controls in Wuhan and nearby cities and continuous quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of breaking the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have significantly damaged the economy and other parts of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March, with the phase of analysis taking 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and colleagues estimate that the COVID-19 epidemic, which is significantly more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Langini and colleagues designed a model to predict the outcome of an epidemic, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both series of nasopharyngeal swab and throat swab samples in recovered patients who were discharged from hospital 2 weeks earlier.
However, there are promising prospects in China based on the reduction in the number of new infections, which means the potential success of current strategies.
Initially, Ebola was projected to infect up to one million people and cause half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may become progressively weaker and eventually disappear or mutate into a virus with less pathogenicity that lives alongside humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is shown below (Figure 5).
SARS-CoV-2 has a high transmission rate through coughing or sneezing and is likely to be transmitted through direct contact with infected material.
The virus was also found in the feces, which raised the possibility of new transmission from the gastrointestinal tract.
A recent study of 138 patients reported that 41% of those infected were likely to have contracted hospital-acquired infections, including 17 patients with other conditions and 40 from healthcare.
Therefore, extreme caution and care must be taken to protect humans, especially healthcare workers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even visitors of infected patients or persons.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is wearing face masks; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series number 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent airborne transmission of respiratory fluid droplets from potentially infected vertebrae to others or from sticking these droplets to surfaces of materials and then spreading to others.
However, only N95 series masks (series number 1860s) can protect against the inhalation of 10 to 80 nanometer variants, which only 5% of variants are able to penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, with both sizes being approximately 85 nanometers.
Because particles can be trapped even between five surgical masks, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (series number 1860s) and refrain from wearing surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare workers should wear fully covering isolation goggles to reduce the risk of further exposure to the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask; it may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also use transparent face shields or eyeglasses when treating patients.
In order to respect public health in areas of infection or potential contamination, it is strongly recommended that individuals wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual, self-quarantine, and stay at home and limit contact with potentially infected people.
The ideal distance between people and patients should be three feet.
These measures are considered effective methods to reduce and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is considered an emerging virus for the human world, its high affinity for SARS-CoV, reported on 7 January 2020, was raised as a serious warning for China, reviving the memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, no public reassurance efforts were made until 19 January 2020, when the head of Wuhan's Center for Disease Control announced that the new virus had limited contagious and effective human-to-human transmission capabilities and that prevention and containment of the disease were possible.
This message caused the public warning to be taken less seriously, especially as the entire country prepared for the Spring New Year Festival, and thus missed a crucial opportunity to prevent the spread of the disease on a minimal scale in Wuhan.
Disease control agencies in China may have learned this difficult lesson and made key improvements for future action.
For example, these organizations should (1) be more cautious when informing the public as any information they provide will be taken into consideration and may change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to abnormal information from clinics, rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) act more rigorously to contain a potential epidemic at an early stage rather than to invite the public to calm down; (4) make continuous, targeted and effective information available to the public to increase public awareness of the epidemic, and continuously test and improve the community response system.
The outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2, began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease has spread throughout China and to about 50 other countries around the world as of this writing.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the early COVID-19 outbreak gave rise to the idea that SARS had returned.
However, there are several distinct differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are of fundamental importance for the purpose of containment of epidemics and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people and men more than young people and women, and has a higher severity and mortality rate in older adults than in young people.
The SARS mortality rate is higher than COVID-19 (10.91 vs. 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the disease even when they are asymptomatic, while SARS patients usually transmit when the disease is very severe, making it much more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and at a wider scale than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, the usual RNA test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be associated with a negative result.
On the other hand, recovered patients can become re-infected with the virus.
These findings significantly increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Given this rapid rate of progress in COVID-19 research, there are still several critical unresolved issues, including:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 virus originate?
Although 96% genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat-like SARS-CoVs, we cannot yet conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
Which animal species was the mediator for transmission of the virus from its original host, bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively interrupt the transmission chain and the outbreak may resume at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical evaluations have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor, how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and provide the basis for subsequent pathological mutations?
Does the virus bind to ACE2 expressing cells in other organs?
Until these questions are clearly answered, we will not be able to achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of the disease.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during human-to-human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or re-emerge like the flu?
Finding answers to this and many other questions is crucial but may take some time.
However, regardless of the costs involved, our only option forward is to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return life to normal.
Animal origins of human coronaviruses
For thousands of years, mutation and adaptation have contributed to the simultaneous evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans.
Before 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known to cause mild diseases, such as common cold.
The outbreaks of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by the virus are shown on other coins, indicating the extent of the devastation and potential risk of a human coronavirus infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 brought the coronavirus back into the spotlight, surprising us with its long transmission, but its pathogenicity is less than that of its sister SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infections are zoonotic, and understanding the animal origin of human coronavirus can help us well.
Most human coronaviruses originate from bats, which are nonpathogenic.
Source hosts of the intermediate reservoir of some HCoVs are also known.
Identification of host animals directly contributes to the prevention of human disease.
Research into the interactions of the coronavirus host in animals could provide important information about pathogenicity in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the information available regarding the seven existing HCoVs, focusing on their discovery history as well as animal origin and interspecies transmission.
Most importantly, we compare and contrast different HCoVs from the perspective of viral evolution and genomic neurophysiology.
The current 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context.
In addition, the conditions for successful migration between hosts and the symptoms of viral evolution over disease severity also came into focus.
CoVs belong to the family Coronaviridae, which includes a group of single-stranded sub-positive RNA coated viruses.
These viruses, which have the largest genome of 26 to 32 kB among RNA viruses, were named "CoVs (coronavirus) " or coronaviruses under the electron microscope because of their crown-like morphology.
Structurally, coronaviruses have single-piece genomes that have a similar organization.
About two-thirds of the genome including the two open reading frames are overlapping (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into polyprotein replicas pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, designated nsp1 through 16.
The remaining protein of the genome includes ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), viral envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoproteins (N).
A number of lineage-specific by-proteins are encoded by different forms of the coronavirus.
Due to differences in protein sequences, coronaviruses are divided into four genera (alpha coronaviruses, beta coronaviruses, gamma coronaviruses, and delta coronaviruses), and among them, the beta coronaviruses genus comprises the majority of human coronaviruses and is divided into four sub-lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents act as the genetic source of most alpha and beta coronaviruses, while birds are the primary reservoir of gamma and delta coronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have continuously crossed species barriers, and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven variants of the HCoV have been identified.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha coronaviruses.
The other five beta-coronavirus types include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV), MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as normal vomiting and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, the recently identified SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe infection of the lower respiratory tract in almost all patients, and significantly increasing the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal mucosa of patients infected with sputum in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information has been gained by conducting extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until before the SARS outbreak, it was widely accepted that infection by HCoVs was generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is one of the most devastating of the modern era, with more than 8,000 people infected and a mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak led to a sustained outbreak in the Arabian Peninsula, with rare cases spreading to the rest of the world.
The novel human coronavirus 2019 ( 2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has killed 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been sounded and the world must prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have animal origins from bats, mice, and domestic animals.
Multiple evidence confirms that the evolutionary origin of all human coronaviruses was bats, where the viruses are well adapted but nonpathogenic and have high genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has brought enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the animal origin of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force, and limiting factors of the mutation of the species.
It may also facilitate or direct research into animals that are reservoirs, intermediates, and replicators of SARS-CoV-2 and be used to prevent similar cases in the future.
In this review study, we provide an overview of the animal origin, interspecies transmission, and pathogenic function of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common phenomenon that the parental viruses of HCoVs are typically nonpathogenic in their reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after transmission between species to a new host.
We continue to study the evolution of the HCoV, where increased transmissibility is often accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this context.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the initial isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814, from the nasal mucous of patients infected with sputum, different strains of the coronavirus were acquired from different infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the past few decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV detection in chronological order (Table 1) may be informative and useful.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated in 1966 from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory infection, then adapted to grow in WI-38 respiratory cell lines.
Patients with HCoV-229E showed symptoms such as normal dizziness, including headache, cough, feeling sick and itching, along with fever and cough in 10 to 20 percent of cases.
Then in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from tissue implants and subsequent sequencing in mouse brains.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCoV-229E, which is similar in symptoms to infections of other respiratory pathogens including influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 both have spread globally and are typically transmitted during the winter season and in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation period of the two viruses is less than a week, and the disease is detected for a period of about 2 weeks.
Based on a human study of volunteers, healthy people who were infected with HCoV-229E had mild rash.
Only a few patients with weakened immune systems developed severe infections in the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented pandemic of human coronavirus in human history, and its etiological agent SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus, has been discovered.
The first SARS case was detected in late 2002 in China's Guangdong Province.
The SARS epidemic has led to 8,096 reported infections with 774 deaths and has spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from mass transmission events, it was estimated that each event could lead to approximately two episodes of secondary infection, with a common duration of 4 to 7 days and a viral peak occurring on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially had symptoms such as muscle pain, headache, fever, weakness, and tremor, and then experienced shortness of breath, cough, and respiratory distress in the later stages.
Lymphopenia, figures outside the scope of liver function tests, and elevated levels of keratin kinase are common abnormal SARS laboratory results.
In SARS patients, cases of alveolar dissemination, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages have also been observed.
About 20 to 30 percent of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory system, several organs including the digestive system, liver, and lungs can become infected in these acute cases, a condition that is usually accompanied by a cytokine storm and may be fatal, especially in patients with weakened immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from a pulmonary biopsy of a relative of a case-specific patient who had traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, there have been many efforts to research the HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was first observed to be common among young children, the elderly, and patients with weakened immune systems or respiratory disease.
Rash, inflammation, fever, and bronchiolitis are common in HCoV-NL63-induced disease.
Another independent study describes the isolation of a similar virus from a nasal mucus sample of an 8-month-old infant with a chest infection in the Netherlands.
Although the case was identified in the Netherlands, it has actually spread around the world.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to be responsible for about 4.7% of respiratory tract diseases, with outbreaks peaking in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is also associated with laryngitis of the larynx, also known as laryngitis of the throat.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized in Hong Kong with chest and lung cancer and bronchiolitis.
In addition to mass-transmitted bronchiolitis and bronchitis, HCoV-HKU1 has also been reported to be associated with acute exacerbation of asthma.
HCoV-HKU1 was identified globally as a cause of mild respiratory illness, as were HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43.
All four cases of mass-transmitted HCoVs were well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause long-acting pathogens, although for unknown reasons there have been rare cases of a longer-acting subtype HCoV-NL63, recently reported in China due to severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
In general, as these HCoVs gain the ability to transmit effectively and maintain their continuity in humans, their infectivity or pathogenicity decreases.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute chest and pelvic dysfunction.
Although most laboratory-confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, several imported spiders and occasional secondary outbreaks from close contact have also been observed in European countries and Tunisia.
A second-degree outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS, which is characterized by progressive acute chest and shoulder pain.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS develop severe pollen deficiency, which is unique among HCoV-associated diseases, for MERS.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a very high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
In mid-to-late December 2019, clusters of patients with chest and pelvic infections were observed in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, who have now been identified as having been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization has declared the SARS-CoV-2 respiratory tract infection outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, and has named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, there were 9,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of about 3.4%.
It is worth noting that the mortality rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 like SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV causes severe respiratory infections that manifest as fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea has also been observed in some patients.
Chest cramps are one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the 82% long nucleotide sequence homology, they fall into two different clusters of phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is clearly less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but is more likely to be transmitted.
Asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, and may contribute to the acceleration of its spread worldwide.
Comparisons and differences between SARS-CoV-2 and six other HCoVs reveal a number of similarities and differences that are very interesting.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 represents a general trend of six other human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms lies between SARS-CoV and four mass-transmitted human coronaviruses (including HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits characteristics that are usually more common during mass HCoV infection, including the presence of abnormal, mild or even absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases may also be considered as SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 continues to show interesting patterns that are indicative of both mass-transmitted HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the other hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as other HCoVs with mass prevalence.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to different humans after infection is reduced, as happened for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can be identified in the gut samples, as can other human coronaviruses.
Whether SARS-CoV-2 oral-rectal transmission, at least under certain conditions, plays a role similar to SARS-CoV, is not yet clear.
It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 will show seasonal patterns, like the mass-spread human coronaviruses.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including its transmissibility, pathogenicity, and sustained spread after transmission from humans will influence the ultimate fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
All four HCoVs have adapted well to humans with mass spread causing mild symptoms.
From another perspective, it may still be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of older HCoV pandemics.
Human coronaviruses that cause severe disease in humans and humans infected with severe human coronaviruses were excluded from the study.
To do this, HCoVs must replicate sufficiently in humans to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize host limiting factors.
In this case, the more stable the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak becomes and the more people become infected, the greater the chance for the virus to complement humans.
If the virus adapts well, it is difficult to prevent transmission by quarantine or other infection control methods.
Over the years, four coronavirus have been circulating in the human population with mass transmission, causing normal outbreaks in individuals with a functioning immune system.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
In contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses have not adapted well to humans and their transmission in humans cannot be stable.
They must maintain and reproduce themselves in animal reservoirs, usually through one or more intermediate hosts and reproducers, seeking an opportunity to transmit to sensitive human destinations.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four other mass-transmitted human coronaviruses.
Just like HCoVs with mass spread, at least for now, it is highly transmissible.
However, it has more pathogenicity than mass-borne coronavirus, but less pathogenicity compared to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Whether it will fully adapt to humans and move between humans without the need for a reservoir or intermediate animal host remains to be seen.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoVs, it is worth discussing the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, storage, mediator and replicator hosts of HCoVs.
An animal is considered an evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it is the host of a close ancestor with high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
An ancestral virus is usually well adapted to the host and is nonpathogenic.
Similarly, the reservoir host maintains HCoVs continuously for a long time.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and act as the natural host of the HCoV or its parent virus.
On the other hand, if the HCoV is recently, before or approximately at the same time as introduction to humans, transmitted to an intermediate host, it does not adapt well to the new host and is often pathogenic.
The intermediate host can act as an animal source for human infection and act as a replicating host that allows the virus to temporarily replicate and then transmit to humans to increase the scale of infection in humans.
A human coronavirus ends up as a block-infection if it cannot sustain transmission in an intermediate host.
Conversely, human coronaviruses can adapt to intermediate hosts and even cause long-term native disease.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
A review of epidemiological data showed that the SARS-indicator case had a history of contact with prey animals.
Subsequent studies of serum prevalence showed that prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV immunoglobulin G was higher in animal traders compared to the general population.
Masked palm frog (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog were first identified in live animal markets as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly based on the fact that no further SARS cases were reported after all the zebras in the market were killed.
However, masked palm civets reported in the wild or on farms that did not come into contact with live animal markets were generally negative for SARS-CoV infection, meaning masked palm civets may only act as a virus replicator host, rather than a natural reservoir for SARS-CoV.
Notably, given that 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals may act as intermediate SARS-CoV replicator hosts cannot be ignored.
It is believed that all of these are the final hosts of SARS-CoV.
The search for a natural animal host for SARS-CoV led to the discovery of a very similar bat coronavirus called HKU3-associated bat coronavirus Rhinolophus (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) in Chinese horseshoe bats.
The results of the antibody test against SARS-CoV and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence in these bats were positive.
This and other bat coronaviruses have 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies established a new concept, meaning that bats are hosts of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats, but none of them, except for the virus known as WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 was found to use bat-derived ACE2, bat-derived fats, and humans as receptors for cell entry.
Interestingly, serums of patients recovering from SARS were able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 has shown the closest ancestry of SARS-CoV in bats, with 95% shared nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not an intermediate parent virus for SARS-CoV and that bats are not the first hosts of the SARS-CoV reservoir.
Phylogenetic analysis clusters MERS-CoV into the same bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat-HKU4 CoV and MERS-CoV both use a similar host receptor, called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences for MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to bat-type coronaviruses identified in Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest bat relative CoV-HKU25 have only 87% of the same nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be the first hosts of the MERS-CoV reservoir.
On the other hand, studies conducted in the Middle East show that dromedary camels are serum positive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, similar to camels of Middle Eastern origin found in several African countries.
A live MERS-CoV similar to the virus found in humans was taken from a mountain camel's nasal sample, suggesting camels serve as the true reservoir hosts for MERS-CoV.
It is important to note that in general, mild but severe viral replication was observed in the strains that were experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is important to note that infected camels transmit the virus not only through the respiratory pathway but also via the gastrointestinal tract, which is the primary mode of transmission in bats.
However, questions remain, as many cases of MERS infection were not previously associated with camels before the onset of symptoms, so it can be concluded that the disease was transmitted from human to human or through unknown animal species and methods that were carriers of MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 exhibits nucleotide homology of 96.2% with the bat coronavirus RaTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to consider a parental relationship between them.
In other words, bats may not be the first hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 reservoir unless similar bat coronaviruses are found in the future.
It is likely that the animal hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate must have been among the wildlife species that were sold and killed at the Hunan seafood wholesale market, which was associated with many of the early cases of COVID-19 and indicates a possible animal-to-human transmission event.
Several new studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals called pangolins (Manis javanica) may also be the ancestral origin of SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoVs.
These new genomes of the pangolin coronavirus have 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are related to RaTG13 to a degree that is about 90% similar in terms of nucleotide sequence.
They form as two sub-lines of SARS-CoV-like viruses in the cluster phylogenetic tree, which have greater receptor-binding domain (RBD) similarity to SARS-CoV-2 and 97.4% amino acid sequence similarity.
In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 RBDs have more variation, although there is more sequence homology in terms of genomics.
A previous study on patient pangolins also reported the detection of viral contents from lung samples that were found to be similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used different collection methods and manual selection to create a partial genome sequence that comprised about 86.3% of the viral genome's complement length.
The possibility that pangolin is an intermediate animal host for SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ruled out.
However, there is currently no evidence of a direct pangolin origin for SARS-CoV-2 due to sequence discrepancies between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs in the pangolin.
Furthermore, the gap between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the gap between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related beta-coronavirus in the pangolin.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins, and other mammals is yet to be determined.
While the highest homology matching in RBDs was found between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 related beta-coronavirus have the highest genome-wide homology sequence sharing.
A high degree of similarity between SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoV RBDs in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be due to evolutionary homology with selection mediation.
A mutually beneficial nootropic proposal is made between a SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-pangulin coronavirus and RaTG13 in a third wild animal species.
Nootropy is promoted as an evolutionary force winner among beta-CoVs.
Research on the non-animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing and cannot be confirmed with certainty.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, animal origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggested that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E both may have originated from bat coronavirus, while parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
A bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) identified in North American tricolor bats has been reported to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat coronavirus, Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, where camels are thought to be mediators.
For more clarity, current knowledge regarding the animal origin of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for the interspecies transmission events of human coronaviruses throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 was first detected in 1890 as an interspecies transmission from domestic animals to humans, a pandemic of respiratory infections was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not well understood.
Bat alpha coronaviruses were found to be closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
Among them is an alpha alpaca coronavirus.
Multiple evidence supports the importance of direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans may have come into contact with bats rather than alpacas, due to the presence of a common ecological niche.
Instead, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, the HCoV-229E-associated bat alpha coronaviruses are diverse and non-infectious in bats, while the alpha alpaca coronaviruses caused outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, no cases of alpaca alpha coronavirus have been observed in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas may transmit HCoV-229E-related alpha coronaviruses from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the herpes virus, Ebola virus, Nepavirus, and the Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats may have transmitted HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, although bat alpha coronavirus acts as a gene reservoir for HCoV-229E, alpacas and mountain camels can act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, as happened with MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to mountain camels and, more recently, from mountain camels to humans.
Early identification of MERS-CoV identified bats as the origin of the evolution of the disease, and subsequent findings confirmed this.
It is clear that bats are a rich source of viral species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, crowded colonies, close social interaction, and strong ability to fly all provide optimal conditions for bats as ideal "virus transmitters".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been established in camels for decades.
The virus has adapted well to these camels, which have evolved from an intermediate host to a stable, natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and has a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its diffuse transmission to humans is accidental, and humans are the host of the MERS-CoV blockade because its transmission between humans cannot continue.
Compared to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins - if at all - in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, pangolin beta coronaviruses are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 alpha-CoVs, similar to the SARS-CoV-related algae.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans are yet to be confirmed or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats can host a reservoir of a SARS-CoV-2 related virus that is approximately similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share an ecological niche with bats through work in slaughterhouses or mines.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate replicator hosts to which the SARS-CoV-2 related virus has recently been introduced.
Humans are infected by slaughter and consumption of game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic and domestic animals, may be at risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2.
A study on domestic and wild animals is needed to investigate antibodies.
Third, the above-mentioned neurophysiology and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for an animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Alongside the different types of animal hosts, there are three main factors of the virus that facilitate the crossing of the interspecies barrier for the coronavirus.
First, their relatively high rate of genetic mutation during RNA replication.
"Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new hosts, the estimated mutation rate for coronaviruses based on an average replacement rate of about 10  4 replacements per year at position 2 can be considered ""medium"" to ""high""".
The coronavirus has an unreadable exoribonuclease, and its removal leads to mutation and severe debilitation or even extinction.
Interestingly, a nucleotide analogue called remdesivir is known to suppress the process of coronavirus replication by inhibiting exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the best medicines to combat SARS-CoV-2 that should be tested clinically.
However, the mutation rates of coronaviruses are approximately one million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, mutation rates are usually high when the coronavirus has not adapted well to the host.
Compared to the high mutation rate in SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is significantly lower, indicating a higher level of human adaptation.
It is likely to have already adapted to another host that is related to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this is true for MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to monoharm camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic mutation can rapidly neutralize vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 antivirals.
Second, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses provides greater flexibility in genome editing for mutations or neurophysiology, resulting in increased probability of co-evolution between species, which contributes to the emergence of new coronaviruses when conditions are right.
This is supported by the abundance of unique open reading frameworks and protein functions encoded toward the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, through a "copy-selection" mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and repeatedly convert patterns during RNA replication.
In the host, which acts as a marker for mixing, transcription of the strand occurs frequently during transcription of the coronavirus RNA.
RNAs with long homologous and complementary length and subgenome can be combined to produce new coronaviruses.
Evidence of natural neurocompound phylogenetics was observed in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as in animal coronaviruses such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Interaction between host and virus in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
The SARS-CoV neutrophil is considered a promoter example here and has shown evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between human and saliva isolates of SARS-CoV, it appears that SARS-CoV adapts rapidly to different hosts, particularly through mutations in RBD and protein S.
Generally, RBD in the S protein of a coronavirus interacts with a cellular receptor and is highly selective with the host antibody response.
The RBD present in SARS-CoV is located at 318 to 510 amino acids on the S1 segment, which causes binding of human ACE2 and also common receptors for virus entry.
The binding domain of the SARS-CoV receptor is able to detect ACE2 receptors in various animals including bats, zebras, mice and dog raccoons, allowing for interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed whose RBDs differed between viruses isolated from humans and bats, and 4 of them are located in receptor binding motif for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV-2 has two mutations, K479N and S487T, in its RBD, which may increase the dependence of spike protein interaction with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes could play a critical role in viral adaptation to humans.
It is important to note that the cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is identical to SARS-CoV.
A 30 percent difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of protein S suggests that the tendency to bind its S protein to human ACE2 has likely changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed a 10-20 times longer affinity for this linkage than the linkage between the ACE2 protein and the SARS-CoV-specific S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine which other auxiliary receptors are necessary for transmission compared to the high mutation rate in SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), but with a different part of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors including aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
This may explain the success of these coronaviruses in adapting to humans after interspecies transmission from the host animal.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is influenced by host-dependencies and limiting factors.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and the natural reservoir hosts of human coronaviruses such as bats, mountain camels, and rodents can form an obstacle to interspecies transmission.
For successful interspecies transmission, human coronaviruses must take on host-dependent factors and suppress host-limiting factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important virus-host interaction need to be identified and characterized.
A genome-wide neutral screening of host affinity and limiting factors for SARS-CoV-2, using advanced CRISPR technology, may be effective.
Emergence of new HCoVs: Back to Zero
The diversity of bat coronavirus provides ample opportunities for the emergence of new human coronavirus.
Based on this, bat coronaviruses act as the genetic source of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic notation also lead to the evolutionary sequence of HCoVs and act as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes could potentially modify viral phenotypes significantly.
Among SARS-CoV by-proteins, ORF8 appears to be important in adapting to humans, as SARS-CoV-associated bat viruses were isolated, but it was found that ORF8 proteins encode the vagr.
A 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoVs was found in isolated populations at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is a type of adaptive mutation that facilitates translocation between hosts.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have had a history of neurophysiology between alpha and gamma lineages of the coronavirus, whereby a large number of smaller neurophysiological segments were identified in RNA-dependent polymerase RNA.
Neurotrophic positions in nsp9, nsp10 major and nsp14 fragments were also identified.
Similarly, it was found that in the MERS-CoV epidemic, there were cases of cross-linear neurophysiology occurring in camels of a cohan in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, nootropic events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, where human coronaviruses are nootropically synthesized with other animal coronaviruses in their own non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can play a role in inducing unintended mutations in viral genomes, most likely the result of viruses being released from selective stresses, for example by the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the complete length loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strand, which occurs due to the removal of two nucleotides.
Although healthy ORF4 can be seen in HCoV-229E-related bat and camel viruses, the alpha alpaca coronavirus has a nucleotide layer that causes a mutation in the reading frame.
More recently, the evolution of emerging human coronaviruses has also been driven by selection pressure on their reservoir hosts.
When bats were infected with the coronavirus, cases were identified as asymptomatic or with mild symptoms, indicating a two-way match between the coronavirus and bats.
It turns out that bats adapted well to the coronavirus, both anatomically and physiologically.
For example, deficiencies in activation of the primary inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology activated by coronaviruses.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to increased production of the inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and low levels of expression of the class one major tissue adaptation complex molecules.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen-containing compounds (ROS) from the long metabolic activity of bats can simultaneously suppress the replication of the coronavirus and affect the uptake of samples by exoribonuclease, resulting in selective pressure to produce strains of the virus that have high complications when introduced to a new host.
CoV strains with higher pathogenicity also evolve by nucleosynthesis, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein traits for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause very mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They multiply aggressively without creating a strong defensive response from the host.
Here are some puzzles as to why asymptomatic vectors are seen and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are usually due to overactivation of the immune system response and cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is isolated from the replication of the coronavirus.
The same strategy for isolating the immune response may have positive effects on the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The interferon response in bats is particularly strong.
Therefore, the use of interferon type I should be useful at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 enzyme in bats is defective.
With this logic, inhibiting NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same general pattern that caused SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although beta-CoVs have 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is one bat-CoV with 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While zebras and other commercially available animals have been identified as hosts of SARS-CoV-like viruses, the first intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
The detected pangolin beta coronaviruses, which are surprisingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, suggest that it is possible that pangolins may have acted as an intermediate host or that the pangolin beta coronaviruses may have played a role in the genome sequences that made up the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the question remains, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally made by humans.
Coronavirus has once again come into focus due to the recent widespread outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronavirus in bats and other animals has significantly altered our understanding of the importance of animal origin and animal reservoirs of human coronavirus in its transmission to humans.
There is compelling evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originated from human-to-animal contact in the marketplace, closing farming markets and killing an animal could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
By the same logic, given the discovery that multiple lineages of the beta-pangolin coronavirus are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be collected from the fertiliser market to prevent animal transmission.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans via pangolins and other animals remains to be determined in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in mountain camels for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is virtually impossible to sacrifice all camels for MERS control, similar to what happened for the control of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in wild animals in the Chinese market.
To stop the recurrence of MERS, a comprehensive approach to developing effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels is needed, along with all necessary measures to control infection.
Because we cannot eradicate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge and cause outbreaks.
Several types of animal coronaviruses are circulating in wildlife.
In particular, bat coronaviruses are highly diverse with the potential for transmission from animal to human.
There is a high chance that these animal coronaviruses will evolve or become neutered, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some areas of China should be abandoned to reduce the amount of unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In view of the disasters caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be developed.
In fact, many viruses have been around for a long time on this planet.
They remain in their natural reservoirs to spread.
Although bats have many characteristics that contribute to the spread of viruses, if people are trained to stay away from these animals, the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential to better understand the ecology of coronavirus and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing their transmission from animals to humans and their future spread.
As a conclusion, the most effective way to prevent transmission of the virus from animals to humans is to keep humans away from natural reservoirs of viruses transmitted from animals to humans.
Several pieces in the animal origin puzzle of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it will be interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins can share a similar ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a direct role in transmission to humans, the manner in which humans contact bats must be determined.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediate host, its interaction with different species including humans, bats and pangolins must be determined.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be at risk of SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be undertaken.
Whether this occurs in a bat, a pangolin, or any other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its closely related parent viruses are expected to be found in their natural hosts in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, along with important insights into the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
"The updating of the COVID-19 diagnostic criteria of ""suspected"" and ""confirmed"" is essential".
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guide to the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 novel coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV), which provides our experience and provides a good reference for the fight against the pandemic worldwide.
However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience. Therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidance and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for suspected and confirmed cases in accordance with the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) led to an outbreak of a pandemic that is now officially designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus as acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a rapid recommendation guide that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
Note that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical experiences. Therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment procedures issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, have been published in a total of seven editions, with some provisions being substantially modified.
Now that our guidelines have received feedback from Zhou and colleagues, they have offered a simple rating proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guide and also provides valuable clues to the global pandemic.
We acknowledge and express our gratitude for their remarkable efforts.
However, according to the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment procedures (trial version 7) and recent studies, their work also needs to be updated.
According to the seventh revision (3 March 2020), for confirmation of a suspected case, each of the features of the epidemic history must be combined with two clinical signs to allow for a comprehensive analysis, or in the absence of an epidemic history, three clinical signs must be present.
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or stay in Wuhan and its surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the past 14 days before symptoms began there; (2) a history of contact with individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 (positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 was reported in the past 14 days before symptoms began; (4) a history of contact with a cluster of confirmed cases (2 cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks in small areas such as home, work, school, etc.).
Clinical signs: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms. (2) have an imaging profile of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count, in the early stage of onset in the normal, decreased, or decreased lymphocyte count category.
Confirmed diagnosis must be based on a suspected case with one of the following pathogenic or serological events: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a viral genome sequence showing high homology with the novel coronavirus; (3) a positive result for specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a conversion of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody from negative to positive or a tetracyclic increase of 4 times or more at a higher recovery stage than that in the acute phase.
We can see that instant PCR testing for nucleic acid in the respiratory system or blood samples has been added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) versions.
Pathogenicity of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and fifth edition (8 February 2020); and serological evidence was subsequently added to the seventh edition.
These improvements are based on the researchers' ongoing efforts to search for an optimized nucleic acid diagnostic kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory system samples including blood samples, which led to the emergence of validated criteria with increased availability of different samples and greater support in relying on a positive antibody result.
In addition, there is increasing evidence that warns us to treat patients with abnormal or asymptomatic conditions with caution.
The flow chart of Zhou and colleagues should therefore be updated, as they classified individuals without clinical symptoms as low risk.
The scoring system should also be validated in further clinical actions and studies.
Finally, we hope there is more direct evidence and we ask readers to provide their views.
To diagnose a suspected and confirmed case, we suggest that they follow the latest guidelines in their countries.
Our team will continue to update guidance on how to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest in a single day
Yesterday, Bangladesh declared five fatalities in a day due to COVID-19.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus in a single day.
Yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research Bangladesh (IEDCR) reported 114 cases of infection and 33 cases of recovery from home-based supplements.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news report, the director of IEDCR, Dr. Mirjad Sabrina Flora, said the dead were four men and one woman.
According to the doctor, two of the cases were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old, and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11 March.
A hospital official told a local news agency Anadolu that one of the fatalities was Jalal Seifur Rahman, the chairman of Bangladesh's Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait's Maitri Hospital.
Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Ubeid al-Qadir, said in an online video statement on Saturday that domestic transport will be on holiday until next Saturday, longer than originally planned.
The domestic transportation holiday program began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of essential goods - medicine, fuel, and food - was still permitted.
The first case of COVID-19 in Bangladesh was reported on March 8 and involved two people returning from Italy, one of whom was infected with the wife.
On March 19, all three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 infections have exceeded one million worldwide
On Thursday, the number of SARS-CoV-2 patients worldwide passed one million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19, the coronavirus disease.
The milestone was the day Malawi reported its first coronavirus case and Zambia reported its first death from the virus.
North Korea claimed on Thursday that it is one of the few countries that remained free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1051,635 confirmed cases, including 793,332 cases in the 24 hours before 10:00 AM Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were recorded, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
CBC News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that more than 1,000 people had died from coronavirus in the United States on Wednesday.
Around the world, countries are taking special measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city lockdown to 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians would be paid without work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days with 215 votes in favour, 10 against and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia announced a curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for the entire day, previously only between 3pm and 6am.
Thailand is set to implement curfew between 10pm and 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state would extend the stay-at-home order until the first of the month.
Stores in Australia lowered the ban on the sale of toiletries per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian chain stores Woolworths and Coles reduced their share of paper towels purchases to two and one pack for each purchase in all stores nationwide, respectively.
ALDI announced a one-pack purchase restriction on Monday.
These restrictions were posted as messages on checkout boxes and Facebook pages of stores.
It is reported that buyers who stockpile soda due to fear of COVID-19 and isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of bathroom towels for door delivery to one package per order.
These conversions followed four previous packages for each transaction restriction introduced on March 4 and 5, respectively, by Woolworths and Coles.
Coles Supermarkets reported in a media interview on March 8 that despite the four-pack restriction, "many stores are reaching supplement sales within an hour of delivery", calling the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI chain stores, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called the sale "unprecedented".
According to a Walworth spokesperson, sales rose by a "steep incline".
Costco in Canberra also limited the allowable quantity to two packages last week.
To alleviate this shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased frequency of delivery, Woolworth ordered additional warehouses, and Aldi pre-stocked for Wednesday's special offer.
Rachel Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Union, said retailers were trying to increase inventory, but local authorities' restrictions on truck traffic time made it difficult.
He expects production costs to rise, as suppliers try to meet demand and have fewer special cases.
On Tuesday, ALDI (chain stores) announced that some stores would not be able to have a special sale on Wednesday due to the early release of stocks.
In a News.com.au report, retail trade expert Dr Gary Mortimer from the Queensland University of Technology said stores are replenishing their inventory every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky commodity that takes up a small amount of space in a large space.
"Rachel Zimmerman told ABC News, ""Coles and Woolworth believe that if there were enough goods on the shelves, if there was and is a supply of enough products like toiletries and disinfectants, you could probably minimize this buying panic"."
Manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday that their stock was exhausted.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Clinix bath towels, and Solaris Piper, the maker of Sorbent, stressed that they work 24 hours a day, seven days a week to meet market demand.
Real estate website Domain.com reported that when buyers are on vacation due to the long Labor Day holiday and fewer auctions are held, some property sellers give free bath towels to the first bidder at Melbourne auctions.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a Darwin-based newspaper, included an eight-page appendix intended for use as a toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia on 3 March, stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions and stated that they had no plans to impose any restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added, "Other products such as masks, disinfectants, dryers, powders and hand washing liquid are in high demand.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed that the British online supermarket Okado on Sunday evening limited the purchase of bath towels to two packs of 12.
WHO declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus a pandemic.
"Although the term ""pandemic"" refers only to how widespread the disease is, and does not indicate how dangerous specific cases are, the WHO noted the need for governments to move towards:
"All countries can still reverse the course of this pandemic".
Tedros Adhanom, WHO Director, believes that "if countries act to diagnose, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize people for the purpose, then they will respond".
" ""We are deeply concerned about the alarming levels of prevalence and severity of disease, as well as the alarming levels of inaction"."
According to Dr. Tom Friedman, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic was "unprecedented".
He said, in a statement released by CNN in February, "Apart from influenza, no other respiratory virus has been identified from the onset of symptoms to a continuing global outbreak".
Ghebreyesus expressed similar views, saying, "We have never seen a pandemic caused by coronavirus before".
He continued, "We have never seen a pandemic that could be controlled simultaneously".
The new status as a pandemic follows the decision of the World Health Organization to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international scale in January.
Dr. Anthony Fosse, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "It's getting worse".
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2020-2019 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) disease, caused by the acute respiratory syndrome of chronic coronavirus 2 (SARS-COVID-2).
The virus outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, declared a national public health emergency of concern on January 30, 2020, and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, causing approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China was estimated at 4%, however, globally it varies from 13.4% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Compounds include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
From exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms, it usually takes about 5 days, but may vary from 2 to 14 days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for the disease.
Primary treatment is actually a form of symptomatic treatment and a supportive treatment. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth during coughing, keeping a distance from others, and screening and quarantining people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have reacted to travel restrictions, quarantines, movement restrictions, workplace hazard controls, and shutdowns.
The pandemic has led to severe global socioeconomic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of resources caused by panic shopping.
Schools and universities are closed in 193 countries either nationally or locally, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has been published online, and there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other ethnic and ethnic minorities in East and Southeast Asia and other regions that have seen high cases of the virus.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased due to reduced travel and heavy industry vacation.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (capital of Hubei Province), reported cases of pneumonia with unknown cause on 31 December 2019, and an investigation began in early January 2020.
The patients were mainly associated with the Hunan seafood wholesale market, so it is thought that the virus originated from zoonosis (a common human-animal disease).
The virus that caused the epidemic, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus with characteristics very similar to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV. It was later found that the first person who developed symptoms was infected on December 1, 2019, and that person had no apparent contact with the seafood cluster.
From the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, it was found that two-thirds of infections were market-related.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the case detected on 17 November 2019 in a 55-year-old man in Hubei Province may be the first case of infection.On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases in China declined, in Italy, Iran and South Korea, infections rose sharply, with the number of new cases outside China surpassing the number of new cases in China for the first time.
Important reports may not be reported as a supplement, especially in cases with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases of the disease have been reported among people of younger age, with only 2.4% of all cases worldwide being people aged 19 and younger.Patrick Wallans, the UK government's senior scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the UK population would need to be infected with the virus to achieve mass immunity.
Cases are in a population that has been tested for COVID-19 and whose testing has been confirmed and declared positive in accordance with official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and the official policy of many countries including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland has been to refrain from testing for those with mild symptoms.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, about 86% of COVID-19 infections had gone undetected, and these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline replication rate (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4 cases.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put it at 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who are not, the time from onset of symptoms to death has varied between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age, and 75% of them had previous underlying conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.Official cases of death from the COVID-19 pandemic generally relate to people who died after being tested and whose COVID-19 test was declared positive according to official protocols.
The actual number of COVID-19 deaths is much higher because these figures do not include those who die without testing, for example, at home or in shelters.
Preliminary data from Italy showed the number of deaths from the pandemic to be 5-4 times the official death toll from COVID.
A spokesperson for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed that ""we know that [the figure] is less than the actual figure"".Reported reports of false counts in the US confirm these statements.This underestimation is often seen in pandemics such as the H1N1 swine flu epidemic.The first confirmed death was reported on 9 January 2020 in Wuhan".
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines and the first death outside Asia on 14 February in France.
As of 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were reported in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, deaths had been reported in more than forty countries and territories, on all continents except Antarctica.Other scales are used to determine mortality.
These numbers vary across regions and time periods, and are influenced by factors such as the number of tests performed, the quality of the treatment system, treatment options, the length of time since the initial outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and public health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of April 10, 2020, the global infection-to-death ratio is 6% (97,039 out of 161,7204).
The figures vary by region.
In China, the estimated disease-related mortality rate decreased from 17.3% (individuals with onset of symptoms for January 1 to 10, 2020) to 0.7% (for individuals with onset of symptoms after February 1, 2020).The remaining calculations include: CFR, which represents the percentage of people diagnosed as dying from a disease, and IFR, which represents the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are timeless and depend on a particular community from infection to recovery.
A number of university researchers have attempted to calculate this figure for a specific population.
The Oxford University Centre for Applied Medicine estimates the fatality rate for a global pandemic as a whole to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of a randomized COVID-19 test in Germany and a statistical study analyzing the effect of this test on estimates of CFR.
The World Health Organization acknowledged that the global pandemic is manageable.
The peak and end times of the outbreak are unknown and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University admitted: "If unchecked, outbreaks of infectious diseases typically remain unchanged for some time and decline after the end of existing hosts".
"But at present, any reasonable prediction of when the disease will end is almost impossible"."
"Chinese government's senior medical adviser, Zhong Nan Shan, said that if all countries can mobilize everyone to comply with WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus, ""it could be over by June"".
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 is "spreading and likely to remain for a year or two".
According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures "will be necessary until a vaccine is available (approximately 18 months or longer)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I believe it is unlikely that the virus will completely disappear - because it is highly contagious" and "it is possible that it will become a seasonal disease that reappears every year".
The severity of the re-infection depends on the herd's immunity and the degree of mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively nonspecific, and infected individuals may be asymptomatic.
The two common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory distress, loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, tremor, vomiting, bloody vomiting, diarrhea, or cyanosis.The World Health Organization states that approximately one in six people become seriously ill and experience respiratory distress.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classifies emergency symptoms as shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or a feeling of pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking from sleep, and bruising of the face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, urgent medical attention is recommended.
Some infected individuals may be asymptomatic and not show clinical symptoms, but the results of testing confirm their infection, so researchers recommend that people who have close contact with these cases be carefully monitored and tested to prevent the spread of infection.
The proportion of asymptomatic patients in China was estimated at fractional to 44%.
The incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) usually varies from one to fourteen days; in the majority of cases it is five days.An example of uncertainty is the estimated fraction of COVID-19 patients who have lost their sense of smell, which has dropped to 30% initially and later to 15%.
Some details regarding the outbreak are being clarified recently.
In the early stages, transmission is believed to be by close contact with droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking, if close contact is considered to be between 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that when coughing without a cover, the droplets can move from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus may also be transmitted by tiny droplets of fluid that are spread, for example, during speech, and remain suspended in the air for longer periods of time.
These droplets may enter the mouth or nose of people close to us and be absorbed into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as tubal and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause airborne respiratory secretions to be released, resulting in airborne discharge.
If you touch an infected surface such as the skin and then touch your eyes, nose, and mouth, the infection may spread.
While there are concerns about the spread of the virus through feces, this risk is not considered to be very serious.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of oral-transmission transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious in the first three days after the onset of symptoms, however, it may spread to others before the onset of symptoms and in the late stages of the disease.
Testing of individuals has been positive up to three days before the onset of symptoms, indicating transmission occurs before significant symptoms appear.
There are only a few reports of lab-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not clear how easily the disease can spread in a complementary manner, one infected person can usually infect two to three others.The virus can remain on surfaces for several hours to several days.
Specifically, it has been observed that the virus is detectable for more than three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, one day on a canvas, and for more than four hours on copper.
However, this is dependent on humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no documented evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although UK authorities recommend washing your hands after contact with animals, as well as when touching other infected surfaces.
Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus that was first observed in three people with chest and hip infections in Wuhan who had low blood oxygen levels and respiratory problems.
All the characteristics of the new coronavirus are similar to those of other naturally occurring coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by ordinary soap, as its protective layer dissolves in the soap. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV.
The disease is thought to have originated from zoonosis or a common disease between humans and livestock.
Genetic analysis has shown that coronaviruses genetically form a cluster with the genus Betacoronavirus and the subgenus Sarbecovirus (subgenus B) along with two strains of bat origin.
The virus has 96% genome-wide similarity to other bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13) strains.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference between pangolin viruses and humans in certain parts of the genomic sequence.
By comparing the entire genome to date, 92% of the genetic material shared between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts.
A viral infection can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, although definitive diagnosis is confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (Rrt-PCR) infectious secretions or CT imaging.
A study comparing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with CT scan (CT) in Wuhan showed that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less specialized, and has many of its visual characteristics overlapping with other types of breast and disease processes.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CT should not be used for screening or front-line testing for COVID-19"".
The World Health Organization has published several protocols for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was on 17 January.
The test uses reverse transcription RNA (rRT-PCR) polymerase chain reaction.
The test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are usually provided within a few hours to a few days.
Generally, this test is performed with a neural tube, although a throat tube may also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these have been sufficiently accurate for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test was designed by Cellex, which has received emergency use authorization only by authorized laboratories.
The distinguishing imaging characteristics in radiology and computed tomography (CT) images of people with symptoms included glass-shaped coccorns and no movement effusions.
The Italian Radiological Association is compiling an online database of imaging findings of confirmed cases.
Because of the synchronicity with other infections such as adenoviruses, imaging without final PCR confirmation is limited for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that although imaging is less commonly used for this infection, it is sensitive and fast and can be used as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based complex neural networks were developed to detect visual characteristics of the virus in radiology and CT images.
Strategies to prevent transmission include general personal hygiene, hand washing, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, coughing or sneezing on towels, and quickly throwing towels in the garbage can.
Those who may have been infected have been advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Physical distancing is also recommended to prevent transmission.Many governments have restricted all non-essential travel to countries and regions affected by the virus outbreak.
However, in large parts of the world, the virus has reached a community-spreading stage.
This means that the virus is spreading across communities and some community members do not know where or what they have been infected with. Caregivers who may be caring for an infected person are advised to take standard precautions, follow contact precautions, and wear eye protection. Tracking the contact history of an infected person is an important method used by health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations issuing a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance measures.
Several mobile apps have been deployed or offered for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth to log in with nearby users.
Users then receive a message asking whether they have recently been in direct contact with a person who tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions have been spread about how to prevent infection, for example, that rinsing the nose and throat with mouthwash is not effective.
No vaccine for COVID-19 exists, however various organizations are working to achieve it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; after flushing, coughing, or sneezing.
Because the virus is killed outside the body with ordinary soap, soap destroys its protective coating.
The CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content if soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a number of solutions (one minute exposure to disinfectants for stainless steel surfaces), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2%-7.5% povidone iodine.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chloroxydine gluconate are less effective.
According to CDC recommendations, if a person is suspected of COVID or has been confirmed in a place such as an office or treatment center, all areas such as offices, health services, outpatient areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by patients should also be sanitized.
Health organizations have advised people to cover their mouths and noses with a towel or a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and to immediately throw away their paper towels.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because masks can reduce the volume and distance of respiratory droplets when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued guidelines regarding when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing masks can reduce the tendency of people to touch their face with their hands, which is the main cause of transmission of infection". Masks are also recommended for people who are watching for suspected cases of disease.
The World Health Organization has advised healthy people to only use masks when they are at high risk, for example, caring for people with COVID-19, although it confirms that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage the public to wear face masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical face masks made of fabric.China in particular recommends the use of medical masks for single use for healthy people in the community, especially in close contact with others at 1 meter (3 feet or less).
Hong Kong recommends the use of surgical masks in public transport or crowded areas.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to produce fabric face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic has banned going out in public places without wearing a mask or a nose and mouth covering.
On March 16, Vietnam urged everyone to wear face masks when in public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government made it mandatory to wear masks for those entering the grocery store.
Israel has required all citizens to wear masks when in public.
Taiwan, which has reached a production capacity of ten million masks per day since mid-March, has made the use of masks mandatory for passengers on railway and intercity bus fleets from 1 April.
In Panama, wearing masks is mandatory when going outdoors, and those who cannot make face masks must make them at home.
Face masks were widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures that are implemented with the aim of reducing disease by minimizing contact between individuals.
The measures include quarantines, travel restrictions, and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
People can observe social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using non-contact parades, and keeping their distance from others.
Many governments have already mandated or recommended social distancing in quarantine areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum population in communities recommended by government agencies and health organizations in the United States was rapidly reduced from 250 (if there were no COVID-19 cases in the area) to 50 and then to 10.
As of 22 March 2020, Germany banned the gathering of more than two people. Older adults and people with concomitant medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and immunodeficiency are at high risk of acute and complicated disease and the CDC recommends that they stay home as much as possible in areas of high prevalence. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health communities replaced the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing" to specify that the goal is to reduce physical contact while maintaining virtual or remote social communication.
The use of the term "social distancing" has given rise to the notion that individuals should participate in complementary social isolation rather than being encouraged to communicate with others through alternative means.Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.
These include recommending that sexual intercourse be limited to a partner who does not have symptoms of the virus.
People with COVID-19 and those suspected of infection are advised to self-quarantine.
Health organizations have provided detailed procedures for appropriate self-quarantine.Many governments have made self-quarantine mandatory or recommended for all populations living in infected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine orders have been issued for high-risk groups.
People who have been in contact with an infected person with COVID-19 and people who have recently traveled to a country or region with a widespread outbreak are advised to self-quarantine for up to 14 days from the time of their last possible contact.
Strategies for controlling the spread of a disease include limiting or eliminating the spread and reducing the rate of spread.
Restrictions are imposed in the early stages of the outbreak and are aimed at tracking and isolating infected individuals as well as introducing other disease control measures and vaccination to stop the spread of the disease to others.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the onset of disease, efforts are shifted to a mitigation phase: measures taken to slow the spread of the virus and reduce its impact on health systems and communities.
A combination of restrictive and mitigating measures may be applied simultaneously.
Suppression of disease requires more intensive measures to bring the pandemic baseline replication rate to less than 1. Part of pandemic management is to reduce the pandemic peak, also called the epidemic curve smoothing.
This reduces the risk of healthcare overload and allows more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may control the spread of the virus include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and quarantine; public measures aimed at physical distancing, such as school closures and cancellation of mass events; public participation to encourage admission and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as cleaning surfaces. A large part of the serious measures aimed at containment of the outbreak in China were implemented when the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as the quarantine of entire cities and travel bans.
Other countries have also taken various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has turned to public screening and local quarantines, and warned against the movement and movement of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support for cases of infection that quarantined themselves and imposed heavy fines on those who ignored quarantining.
Taiwan increased the production of masks and imposed heavy fines for the confiscation of medical equipment.Simulations conducted with the United Kingdom and the United States showed that mitigation (reducing rather than stopping the epidemic) and containment (reversing the epidemic) pose major challenges.
Optimal adjustment policies may reduce peak health demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and overcapacity of health systems.
Suppression can be undertaken, but must continue as long as the virus is circulating among humans (or until a vaccine is developed, whichever comes first), otherwise the virus will re-emerge and spread when some of the strict measures are eased.
Long-term interventions to combat pandemics have social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drug has been approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking anti-epileptic medication without a prescription, drinking fluids, and resting can be effective in relieving symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and assisted breathing may be necessary.
Steroid use may exacerbate complications.
Several drug combinations that were previously effective in treating other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also stated that certain "home and traditional remedies" can reduce the complications of SARS-COVID-19.
Increasing capacity and implementation of healthcare to address the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as a critical response to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) and the European Regional Office of the World Health Organization have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary care health services to convert resources at various levels including from focusing laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, cancelling selective procedures where possible, isolating and quarantining COVID-19 positive patients, and increasing the capacity of intensive care by training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories regarding the identity of the first infected person (called patient number zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus may date back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of coronavirus infections gradually increased in Hubei.
Most of these were related to the Hunan seafood wholesale market where live animals were sold, and one theory is that the virus was found in these species of animals, or in other words, it was of zoonotic origin.A pneumonia cluster with unknown cause was observed on December 26 and was treated by Dr. Zhang Jian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, and this was reported to the Wuhan Xiangnan Disease Control Center on December 27.
On 30 December, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues to a "similar SARS coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were questioned by police for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for raising the alert level.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on 31 December and informed the WHO.
A significant number of cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to Wuhan health authorities in early January, prompting an investigation.In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled, roughly every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China due to the arrivals of Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is one of the transportation hubs and the intersection of major rail lines.
On 20 January, China reported approximately 140 new cases, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later, official data showed that as of January 20, 2020, 6,174 people had developed symptoms.As of March 26, the United States had surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide, with more than 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 recoveries.

A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
With the release of these announcements, the police warned Wuhan doctors about the "spread of rumors" regarding the epidemic.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "conclusive evidence" of human-to-human transmission of the disease.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that Communist Party of China Secretary General Xi Jinping later described as a "people's war" to curb the spread of the virus.
"During what has been described as the ""worst quarantine in human history"", a health belt was announced on January 23 that halted entry and exit to/from Wuhan and spread to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting an estimated 57 million people".

COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread from China to South Korea on January 20, 2020.
The National Health and Medical Research Council reported a significant increase in confirmed infections on February 20, largely due to the gathering in Daegu for a new religious movement called Shincheonji Church of Christ.
Shincheonji supporters who met with Daegu from Wuhan are suspicious of the origin of the virus.

Screening methods include mandatory self-reporting of symptoms for new arrivals on international flights via mobile apps, onboard testing for the virus with results to be announced the next day, and increased testing capacity to 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite the absence of quarantines in entire cities.Initially, South Korean society became bipolar in President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.

A CNN report noted that the combination of two factors, Italy's low population and the inability to test all people who have been infected with the virus to date, could have led to a high death rate.
The UK's response to the virus was initially reflected as one of the worst affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the UK government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government was criticised for not taking swift action and being serious in responding to public concerns.On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in his speech, banned non-essential travel and social contact, urging people to work from home if possible and to refrain from going to places such as bars, restaurants and cinemas.

The WHO compared this situation to the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004, during which Chinese officials were accused of withholding information, which negatively affected efforts to prevent and contain the spread of the virus, and in the current crisis, the central government "to prevent the epidemic of the disease before the solar New Year holiday, took regular notification measures".
On 23 January, WHO spokesperson Gaudén Galli, in response to the central authorities' decision to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, declared that ""this was certainly not a WHO recommendation"" but ""a very important sign of commitment to contain the epidemic in a place where it is most widespread"" and called it ""unprecedented in the history of public health"".On 30 January, after confirming human-to-human transmission outside China and an increase in cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak an international public health emergency and the sixth such case since the first situation emerged during the 2009 influenza virus pandemic".

"The virus is on the way and you need to be prepared and remind them that the right response can help the world avoid it ""getting worse"".
Ryan further stated that current data does not guarantee that public health authorities will declare a global pandemic because such a declaration would mean that ""we necessarily accept that every human in the world will be infected with this virus""".
On 11 March, the World Health Organization declared the spread of coronavirus a global pandemic.
The Director-General said that WHO is "really concerned about the alarming levels of epidemic and disease severity and the alarming levels of inaction".

Several state executives of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed for their management of the quarantine effort in Central China, reflecting dissatisfaction with the political institution's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some critics believe that the move was to protect Communist Party of China Secretary General Xi Jinping from public outrage at him during the coronavirus epidemic.
Some high-ranking Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, refused early awareness of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, which fueled US and Italian conspiracy theories about China as the root cause of the COVID-19 outbreak.
"The Donald Trump administration in the United States has referred to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" or the ""Wuhan virus"" and said that ""censorship has caused a viral outbreak that has now become a global pandemic"" which in turn has been criticized by some critics as racism and ""distracting attention from his administration's inefficiency in containing the disease"".
The Daily Beast has obtained a cable network for communication measures from the National Security Council, using a strategy called "Everything is under China".
"We are being asked to do our utmost to make this message available to the public by any means possible, including press conferences and television interviews. " "News outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of its propaganda for global influence. "
"Joseph Borel, the EU's foreign policy chief, warned that ""there is a geopolitical component that involves attempts to influence by distraction and 'liberal politics.'"

On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent Russian troops to Italy to send military supplies, special disinfectants and other medical equipment.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa, citing "an unknown "top political source", said that 80% of Russian aid to Italy was "useless or of little use".
The source accused Russia of abusing the "geopolitical and diplomatic" conditions with its offensive and deceptive action.
Attilio Fontana, the Lombard president and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, rejected the media report and praised the efforts.
Russia sent a medical aid aircraft to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated, "When we offered assistance to our colleagues in the United States, we assumed that when manufacturers of medical equipment and products in the United States resume their operations, they would also be able to help us reciprocally if necessary".
The planned NATO "Defender 2020" war games in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states will be held on a reduced scale, the largest war games since the end of the Cold War.
Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Keith Hudson criticized the performance of Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, not only the lives of American troops and many European countries involved are at risk, but also the lives of residents of countries where operations are conducted". The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus, and nearly twenty-four members of parliament, as well as fifteen other current or former political figures, have been infected".
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani sent an open letter to world leaders on March 14, 2020, requesting assistance, saying his country was struggling to combat the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran.The outbreak has prompted the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries including universal health, universal child care, family leave with entitlements, and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts predicted that the pandemic could negatively impact Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election and relations between Japan and South Korea.
After Japan announced it would quarantine all incoming travelers from South Korea for two weeks at government-designated locations, South Korea criticized Japan for "vague and passive knowledge of quarantine efforts".
South Koreans have been ambivalent about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Numerous Koreans signed pamphlets either calling for Moon's resignation, citing what they claimed was government inefficiency in the outbreak, or praising his response.The pandemic has allowed countries to enact emergency laws to implement appropriate responses.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this may lead to governments holding power more tightly.
In Hungary, the country's parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule with an indefinite mandate, suspending parliament and elections, and punishing those who spread misinformation about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been caused by several instances of shortage of supplies, which are due to increased use of coronavirus-fighting equipment, panic buying and disruption of factory operations and logistics.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings regarding shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and supply disruption.
Several areas also saw an influx of shoppers, which led to the shelves being emptied of essential goods such as food, toiletries and bottled water, leading to shortages.
The technology industry in particular has warned of delays in shipping electronic goods.
According to Tedros Adhanom, Secretary General of the World Health Organization, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to a price increase of up to twenty times the usual price and delayed supply of medical items for four to six months.
It has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment in the world, and the World Health Organization has warned that it will put workers' health at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Diego retailers to sell Australian products in China.
This activity led to a shortage of baby formula in some supermarkets and resulted in the Australian government banning it.Despite the high number of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region and the resulting high demand for food, neither region suffered severe food losses.
China and Italy's actions against the monopoly and illegal trafficking of essential products were successful, and also prevented the severe food shortages that were predicted in Europe as well as in North America.
Agricultural production in the northern Italian regions, which produce the bulk of agricultural products, has not declined significantly, but according to representatives of the sector, prices may rise.
Empty food shelves even in Wuhan were only temporary, as top Chinese officials opened up pork warehouses to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws in Italy require food producers to store for such emergency occasions.
The damage to the world economy was felt in China: According to a media report on 16 March, the Chinese economy suffered a severe hit in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to contain the outbreak of the virus, with retail sales falling by 20.5%.
As mainland China is one of the major economic and manufacturing hubs, the outbreak of the virus is a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Information Unit predicted that markets would remain volatile until the status of potential outcomes became clearer.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth may be greater than the SARS outbreak in 2002-2004.
According to an expert at Washington University in St. Louis, global supply chains will be affected by up to $300 billion, which will continue for up to two years.
"According to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), oil prices have ""faced a serious decline"" due to the decline in demand from China".
The world's stock markets collapsed on February 24 due to a significant increase in COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On 27 February, rising concerns over the coronavirus outbreak led to an unprecedented drop in the NASDAQ-100, S&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp, P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average drop by 1,191 points, its highest in a single day since the financial crisis of 2007.
All three indexes were down more than 10% at the end of the week.
On 28 February, rating company GMBH Scope confirmed China's credit rating but had a negative outlook.
Stocks, again, fell sharply due to fears of coronavirus, with the biggest drop being on March 16.
Many consider a recession likely.
Economist Mohammed al-Arian praised the timely emergency measures by central banks and countries.
Central banks reacted more quickly than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Due to travel restrictions, the closure of public places such as tourist attractions, and government advice not to travel to other countries, the tourism industry is among those most affected.
As a result, several airlines have cancelled flights due to lack of demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the UK regional airline Flybe went bankrupt.
The impact on the cruise industry was unprecedented.
Several train stations and shipping ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunian, the main travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
National and regional governments canceled a number of events such as the New Year celebrations, which were attended by large crowds, and private companies independently closed their stores and tourist attractions, such as Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent crowds, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple exhibitions.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, provincial and regional authorities extended the New Year holiday until 10 February and ordered most workplaces not to open on that date.
These regions represented 80% of domestic production and 90% of exported products.
Hong Kong raised its response to the epidemic to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, shutting schools until March and cancelling New Year celebrations. Retailers around the world were affected and had their working hours reduced or temporarily suspended.
Retail visits in Europe and Latin America have fallen by 40%.
Middle Eastern and North American retailers saw 50 to 60 percent offsets.
This also led to a sharp drop in store purchases in March compared to February.
The world's largest shopping mall operators have taken complementary measures, such as increasing sanitation, installing temperature scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and canceling events.The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimates that the pandemic-induced depression will cause 14 to 22 million people in Latin America to live in absolute poverty, more than the number without pandemic status.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the pandemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
A large number of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers are either stuck at home in offshore provinces or stuck in Hubei Province.As of March 2020, more than 10 million Americans had lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus outbreak could affect up to 47 million jobs in the United States and raise the unemployment rate to 32%.Complementary quarantine in India has led to the unemployment of ten million Indian migrant workers (who work on a salaried basis).Results of a survey conducted by the Angus Reed Institute showed that 44% of Canadian families were experiencing some form of unemployment.Since the Complementary Quarantine was implemented in mid-March 2020 in Spain, about 900,000 workers have lost their jobs.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit (Universal Credit).
The German Short-Term Work Compensation Scheme has also been adopted by France and the United Kingdom.
Sectors active in the performing arts and cultural heritage were severely impacted by the negative aspects of the pandemic, which affected the performance of organizations and individuals, both staff and freelancers, around the world.
Cultural and artistic sector organizations have sought to support their mission (often with public funds) to ensure public access to cultural heritage, maintain the safety of their staff and the public, and where possible support artists.
As of March 2020, around the world, to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues and other cultural institutions, along with their exhibitions, events and performances that had been cancelled or postponed, were closed indefinitely.
In response, there have also been efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerating case of disease reduction is the cancellation of religious events, major sporting events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also been disrupted.The Vatican announced that the Holy Week celebration in Rome, which was supposed to be held during the last week of Lent, was also cancelled.
Many bishops have advised older Christians to stay home rather than attend Sunday services; some churches have broadcast church services via radio, online broadcasting, or television, while others recommend individual worship.
As the bishop of the Roman Catholic Church closed its churches and St. Peter's Square was emptied of Christian pilgrims, other religious institutions canceled services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and shrines.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced that Friday prayers in contaminated areas would be cancelled and religious sites would continue to be closed due to the outbreak, while Saudi Arabia banned pilgrimage to holy sites in Mecca and Medina for its citizens while preventing foreign visitors from entering.
The pandemic has caused the most significant interruption in sporting events since World War II.
Most major sporting events have either been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2020 NHL season.
The outbreak also disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would "be postponed to a date other than 2020, but not beyond the summer of 2021".Casinos and other venues around the world were closed, and live poker events were either postponed or cancelled.
This led to many gamblers switching to online gambling, and many online gambling sites reported a significant increase in their site visits.The entertainment industry has also been affected, and several music groups have suspended or canceled their concert tours.
Many major theaters, including those on Broadway, also suspended all their sci-fi productions.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing work via the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances such as live concerts or the creation of web-based "Internet festivals" for artists to perform, distribute, and promote their work.
Online coronavirus trolls are circulating to distract and joke around this black cliff.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a strong negative bias, xenophobia, and racism towards people from China and East Asia, and against people from high-infection countries in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Incidents such as fear, doubt and violence have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when most cases were still confined to China) reflected the racist sentiments of various groups around the world who saw the Chinese as deserving of the virus and what was claimed as punishment.
Some African countries have also seen rising anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported being discriminated against because they were from the region.
There has been online and offline assistance from areas affected by the virus in China.
As the outbreak progresses in countries with new high infection rates, the people of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious spread of COVID-19, may continue to be vulnerable to suspicion and xenophobia from citizens of other countries.Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed leaflets to ban Chinese nationals from entering their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asian people in the UK and the US have reported increasing levels of racist insults and attacks.
President Donald Trump has faced criticism for naming the coronavirus the "Chinese virus", a term that critics see as a sign of racism and anti-Chinese sentiment.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Wuhan and transferred to Novi Sad.
According to reports, students from the northeastern regions of India that share a border with China and students studying in major cities of India have been affected by the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, the head of the Bharatiya Janata Party's state wing in South Bengal, stated that the Chinese destroyed nature and ""that is why God took revenge on them""".
"These remarks were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta as ""a mistake"".In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese citizens intensified after the pandemic, with foreign nationals being labeled as ""foreign trash"" or told to be thrown into a ""garbage bin"".
Many newspapers with a money section have removed these sections to cover coronavirus news.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific articles related to the virus outbreak freely available to the public.
Some scientists decided to quickly share their results on pre-printed servers like bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes two types of methods, methods that detect the presence of the virus and methods that detect the presence of antibodies produced in response to the presence of infection.
The presence of viruses in samples was confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects RNA coronavirus.
This is a specific test and is designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA only.
It is used to confirm very new or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used both for disease diagnosis and for population surveillance.
Antibody testing shows how many people were infected, including those whose symptoms were so weak that no reporting was necessary or who had no symptoms.
The exact mortality rate and herd immunity level in the population can be determined using the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there is considerable variation in the number of tests performed in different countries around the world.
Convertibility is also likely to be significantly influential on reported deaths, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcriptional RNA polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), testing can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including a bioluminescent or a bulgamous sample.
Results are usually announced after a few hours or up to 2 days.
RT-PCR tests performed with a throat-only sample taken in the first week of the disease are reliable.
The virus may then disappear in the throat, although it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected cases tested in the second week, sample material can be obtained from the lower respiratory tract by suction catheter or exfoliation.
One of the first PCR tests was prepared in January 2020 by Charité in Berlin, using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and providing the basis for the manufacture of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK has also produced a test as of 23 January 2020. South Korea's Kogenebiotech manufactured a clinical-grade SARS-CoV-2 detection kit, based on PCR, called PowerChek Coronavirus, on 28 January 2020.
The "E" gene is present in all beta coronavirus variants and tracks the RdRp gene, which is only present in SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was the first company to receive emergency use approval from the China National Medicines Agency for a SARS-CoV-2 base PCR detection kit. In the United States, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is authorizing its own Real-Time RT-PCR detection panel for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) through the International Reagent Resource in public health laboratories.
One of three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits was left incomplete due to a defect in the identifier, causing trials at the Atlanta CDC to run into problems; this led to a reduction in the number of samples successfully evaluated by an average of 100 per day for the entire month of February 2020.
The certainty of tests using two components was not determined until February 28, 2020, and state and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing from this date.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization.US commercial laboratories began testing it in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced that RT-PCR-based COVID-19 tests are available nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics also made COVID-19 testing kits available nationwide from March 9, 2020.
No quarantine restrictions have been announced; sampling and analysis must be done according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was designed and developed by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Agency for Healthcare Supervision and Administration. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in 3.5 hours and in large volumes, resulting in a machine capable of performing approximately 4,128 tests every 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Abbott Laboratories for testing of Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued a similar authorization for Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received an EUA from the Food and Drug Administration for a 45-minute trial.
The Food and Drug Administration has approved a trial that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Given that this does not require a set of alternating temperature cycles, this method can determine a positive result in only 5 minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
There are currently 18,000 of these machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to produce 50,000 tests per day with rapidly increasing production.A trial is currently under construction in Taiwan that uses a monoclonal antibody, a substance that specifically binds the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of new coronaviruses; it is hoped that this test will provide results within 15 to 20 minutes, similar to a rapid influenza test.
As of March 2020, a review of records concluded that "Cerebral radiography is of little value for diagnosis in the early stages of disease, while CT findings may be present even before symptoms appear".
Common features of CT include bi-directional polygonal glass matte codorites with a lateral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance occurs with disease evolution, penetration, and crazy paving patterns.
A study in Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic, compared PCR and CT to each other and found that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specialized, and has many imaging features that overlap with other diseases of the chest and lungs (pneumonia) and respiratory problems.
As of March 2020, the US Department of Radiology has recommended that "CT should not be used for disease screening as a first line test for COVID-19". As of March 2020, the CDC has recommended that PCR be used for screening.
Part of the immune system's response to disease is the production of antibodies such as IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect disease in individuals, 7 days or more after onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and for population monitoring. Testing can be done in central laboratories (CLT) or through point-of-care testing (PoCT).
High-power automated systems in many laboratories will be able to perform these assessments, but access to them will depend on the production ratio for each system.
For CLT, a single blood sample is usually used, however, sequential samples can be used to track the immune system response.
For PoCT, blood sampling is usually obtained by perforating the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, there is no need for pre-sampling elimination procedures.On 26 March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified 29 companies that had notified the agency of the requirements and were therefore able to distribute their own antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA for emergency use.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples per hour and is therefore much faster than the usual PCR evaluation for viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detectable within 14 days of infection onset.In early April, the UK announced that none of the antibody test kits purchased were good enough.
Hong Kong has set up a scheme whereby those suspected of having the disease can stay at home, "the emergency department gives a sample tube to the patient", the patient puts a tofu in the tube, sends it back and receives the test results after a while.The NHS in the UK has announced that it is testing a scheme whereby suspected cases are tested at home to eliminate the risk of transmission on the way to hospital or the need to disinfect the patient's ambulance.In the service centres carrying COVID-19 testing for suspected cases, a health service specialist will sample using appropriate precautions".
Drive-through centers helped South Korea implement one of the fastest and most comprehensive testing in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Forensic Health Insurers announced on 2 March that it had the capacity to conduct around 12,000 tests per day inside ambulances, up from 10,700 tests the week before.
When the doctor prescribes the test, the health insurance will cover the costs.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to carry out a total of 160,000 tests per week.
By 19 March, several major cities were offering riding test services.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was also unknown, as only positive results were reported.
"The first laboratory study showed that by the 12/2020 calendar week, a total of at least 48,3295 samples had been tested, with the week of 12/2020 itself being taken into account, and the SARS-CoV-2 test result was positive for 33,491 people (6.9%).In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a method for testing samples taken from 64 patients simultaneously, where all samples were combined and tested, and if positive, samples were tested individually.A 2,000-square-meter Emergency Diagnostic Laboratory in Wuhan called "Ho-yan"" (Chinese: 火眼, meaning "eye of fire") was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which could test 100 000 samples per day.
BGI founder Wang Jian personally oversaw the 5-day project, which was modeled to show that if this capacity had not been increased, infections in Hubei would have increased by 47% and the cost of implementing quarantine would have doubled.
After Wuhan, Hu-Yin laboratories were quickly established in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily output was 50,000 tests. Open source and composite designs developed by Origami Assays have been released, allowing up to 1,122 samples to be tested for COVID-19 using just 93 tests. These balanced designs can be implemented in small laboratories without the need for robotic fluid tools.
By March, shortages and inadequate quantities of the detector were one of the bottlenecks of mass testing in the EU, UK and the US.
This led some researchers to consider sample preparation protocols, which include heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing.On 31 March, it was announced that the UAE had tested more people against coronavirus than any other country at the time, relative to its population, and was on track to reach the testing level for its entire population.
This was done by combining the ability to provide mounted services and the purchase of a mass population-scale sampling laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Ho-Yan" emergency identification laboratories in China).
The lab, built in 14 days, is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first of this scale to be operational outside China.
Different testing procedures that target different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The WHO took advantage of German guidelines to produce kits for delivery to low-income countries that do not have sufficient resources to manufacture the kits.
The German guidelines were published on 17 January 2020; the US CDC protocol was not available until 28 January, delaying testing available in the US. China and the US had problems with the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demands and recommendations of health experts for testing.
On the other hand, experts say widespread access to testing in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
Testing capacity, mostly in the form of private sector laboratories, was built up over the course of several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization announced that testing programs should be accelerated as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus had caused hundreds of thousands of tests to pile up in private laboratories in the United States, and the supply of sampling equipment and chemicals to be severely limited.
In March 2020, China reported that its production test kits were problematic and inaccurate.
In the United States, the CDC-made test kits were "defective"; the government then removed administrative barriers that prevented private testing.Spain purchased the test kits from a Chinese company called Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd but found the results to be incorrect.
The company explains that incorrect results may be the result of not receiving the appropriate sample or incorrect use of the test kit.
The Spanish Ministry of Defence announced that it would collect kits containing incorrect results and convert them into a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits the Czech Republic purchased from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China which were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matović suggested that they be dumped into the Danube.Agatara, a member of the Turkish Ministry of Health, said the test kits that Turkey purchased from China had a "high error rate" and were "not used".The UK purchased 3.5 million kits from China but in early April 2020 announced that the kits were unusable.
Testing, along with quarantining people who tested positive and tracking people who had contact with people infected with SARS-CoV-2, led to positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo', where the first COVID-19 death was recorded in Italy, conducted two phases of testing on all 3,400 inhabitants of the city, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all detected cases were quarantined.
By restricting urban travel, new infections were eliminated.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic spread in Singapore much more slowly than in other developed countries due to strict contact tracing, domestic travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, but no severe restrictions were imposed, such as mandatory closures of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events were cancelled and Singapore advised its citizens to stay at home on 28 March, but schools reopened on 23 March after a holiday.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, also managed the pandemic with strict contact tracing programs, domestic travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but with less stringent waivers.
A statistical study showed that countries that performed more diagnostic tests than deaths had much lower death rates, possibly because these countries are better able to identify cases of influenza that have only mild symptoms or which do not.
The WHO recommends that countries that lack testing capacity and have laboratories with limited experience in relation to COVID-19 send the first five positive and the first ten negative COVID-19 samples for confirmation to one of the WHO's 16 reference laboratories.
Outside of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Asia, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The table below in the column "Positivity by % of tests" is influenced by each country's testing policy.
Under perfectly equal conditions, a country that tests only hospitalized people, compared to a country that tests all citizens, regardless of the onset of symptoms, has a higher percentage of positive cases.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also called hand hygiene, refers to the act of removing dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances from the hands.
Washing hands with soap consistently at "critical moments" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and plague, which are transmitted via the gastro-ocular route.
People can also be exposed to respiratory diseases such as influenza or common cold if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (e.g., mucous membranes).
There are five important times a day to wash hands with soap to reduce oral-transmission of disease: after going to the bathroom (sweating and spitting), after wiping the baby's underwear (diaper change), before feeding the baby, before eating, and before and after preparing food or when touching raw meat, fish or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, wash your hands with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing.
Before, during, and after cooking.
Before and after caring for a patient.
After changing a diaper or cleaning a child who has used the toilet.
Coughing or sneezing after emptying the nose.
After touching animals, feeding them and touching their excrement.
Medical hygiene refers to the hygienic activities associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before using medication or other therapeutic measures can prevent or minimize the spread of the virus.
The primary medical purpose of handwashing is to cleanse hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause injury or disease.
This is of particular importance to people who work with food or in the medical field, but is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing diseases that lead to diarrhea; and reducing respiratory infections.
And decreased infant mortality in home births.
A 2013 study found that improved handwashing procedures may lead to minor improvements in the average growth of the kidneys in children younger than five years.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by simple behavioral changes such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action could reduce the mortality rate in these diseases by 50%.
Interventions that promote handwashing are able to reduce diarrhea by about one-third, equivalent to clean water supply in low-income areas.
48% of reductions in diarrhea cases can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and inexpensive method for preventing diarrhea and respiratory infections (ARI), which is routinely done in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the number one cause of death among children under five, claiming 1.8 million lives annually.
Diarrhea and asthma are also the cause of approximately 3.5 million infant deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, replacing hand washing before eating and after going to the bathroom with a sustainable routine could save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, cutting diarrhea deaths by nearly half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually supplemented with other disinfection interventions with water, disinfection and personal hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also prevents impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
The minor detrimental effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage due to dry skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark showed that excessive hand washing can lead to itching and scarring of the skin, known as eczema or dermatitis, a condition that is particularly common among health care workers.
Excessive hand washing is also known as an OCD symptom.
There are five important times a day to wash hands with soap to reduce oral-transmission of disease: after going to the bathroom (sweating and spitting), after wiping the baby's underwear (diaper change), before feeding the baby, before eating, and before/after preparing food or when touching raw meat, fish or poultry.
Other times when handwashing techniques should be followed to prevent transmission include before and after treating a wound or wound, after coughing, sneezing, or flushing; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is low.
A 2015 study on handwashing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of people washed their hands with soap.In 2014, a study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of upward handwashing at 97%, the United States was close to the average at 77% and China had the lowest rate at 23%.Several behavioral transformation methods in handwashing with soap are currently in place.Group handwashing for school children at a specific time is a method to induce behavioral transformation in children.
The "Critical Health Care Program" launched by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of measures to improve the health and education of children.
Twice a year, handwashing, fluoridation, and daily handwashing are the most important elements of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by adding soap or detergents to the water.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barrier to dissolving in water, to increase solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective skin cleanser, as fats and proteins, which are the building blocks of organic soil, do not dissolve easily in water.
However, running water will help.
Solid soap may contain slightly more bacteria than previous uses because of reusability.
A small number of studies that assumed bacterial transmission from solid soaps were possible have concluded that such transmission is unlikely, since bacteria are washed off with soap.
The CDC also states: "Liquid soap is recommended with the possibility of use without the need for hand contact".
Antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted to promote public health.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of prescribed antiseptics or disinfectants can produce antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps include common antibacterials such as triclosan, which have a wide list of resistant strains of organisms.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not eliminated by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as previously advertised.
In addition to surfactants and skin preservatives, this advanced formula may include acids (sticky acid, ascorbic acid, and lactic acid) as pH regulators, active benzoic acid with antimicrobial properties, and other skin moisturizers (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, herbal extracts). A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health found that plain soaps are as effective as grade-one antibacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing disease and killing hand bacteria.
Hot water, which is convenient for hand washing, is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water at eliminating natural contaminants that contain soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific research has shown that hot water use does not have any effect on reducing hand viruses.
A hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a non-water-based agent for cleaning hands.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, water-based hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, hand sanitizers, or hand sanitizers) became increasingly popular.
They are often based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with a constituent such as a carburetor (a polymer of acrylic acid) that converts to gels, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for convenient use with alcohol and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide increases its antimicrobial activity.Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are highly effective at killing microbes.
Alcoholic antimicrobials kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), the causative agent of tuberculosis, and a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
70% alcohol disinfectants can kill up to 99.97% (a logarithmic reduction of 3.5, equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of hand bacteria in less than 30 seconds and 99.99% to 99.999% (a logarithmic reduction of 4 to 5) of hand bacteria in 1 minute.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost ineffective as a complement to neuroviruses (or Norwalks), the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.A sufficient hand sanitizer or alcohol-based lubricant should be applied to the skin, thoroughly moistened, and both hands covered.
The front and back of both hands and the middle and ends of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds to dry the liquid, floor or skin.
The fingertips should also be thoroughly washed with a hand soap.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands, especially when hands are visibly dirty, rather than hand sanitizers.
Increasing use of these detergents is based on ease of use and rapid activity in killing microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing, unless soap and water are available.
Repeated use of alcohol disinfectants causes dry hands, unless a moisturizer and/or softener is added to their formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced by adding glycerin and/or other moisturizers to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing moisturizers caused less burning and dryness compared to soaps with antibacterial content.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact itching syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hand-made alcohol garments occur rarely.
It is popular because it causes less itchy contact dermatitis than hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their long-term efficacy, non-hydroactive base agents do not clean hands of organic matter, but only disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of pathogens, as pathogens still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers is highly dependent on the ingredients and formulation, and has historically been much less effective than alcohol and alcohol-containing garments.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have shown sustained and increased antimicrobial activity after self-use, unlike alcohol, which after repeated use is likely to decrease in efficacy due to progressive reverse reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use dust and ashes.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water, but probably less effective than soap.
Another concern is contamination of soil or ash with microorganisms, which may contribute more to the spread of disease than to its reduction.
Ash, like soap, is an antiseptic, because it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
The World Health Organization recommends ash or sand as a substitute for soap when soap is not available.
The proper handwashing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent transmission of disease includes the following steps:
Wet your hands in hot or cold water.
Running water is recommended because the stagnant pools may be contaminated, although the water temperature may not appear to be different.
Rub your hands, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails with plenty of soap.
Soap removes microbes from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap compared to when using only plain water.
Rub your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Massaging the hands creates friction that helps kill germs, while massaging for longer periods of time kills more germs.
Pump well under the tap.
Washing in a single sink can re-infect the hands.
Dry the cloth with a clean cloth or let it dry in the winter.
Wet, damp hands are more likely to re-infect. Parts that are not washed often include the thumb, wrist, between the fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cut nails may be contaminated with microorganisms.
Moisturizing creams are often recommended to prevent dry hands; dry skin can lead to skin damage, which can increase the risk of infection transmission.
"Various inexpensive alternatives can be used where needed in developing countries to facilitate handwashing where tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, pouring water and/or soap from a hanging gallon or dry cod cover with suitable holes and/or using ash. In limited irrigation conditions (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), water-saving solutions such as ""tube-free taps"" and other low-cost options exist".
Handless tap is a simple technology that uses a piece suspended by a rope and a leg-operated lever to pour a small amount of water over the hands and a soap mold.
Proper hand drying is an important part of hygiene, but there is debate over the most effective method of drying hands in public toilets.
A growing volume of research suggests that paper towels are much healthier than the electric dryers used in most toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster in London and sponsored by the Paper Hand Towel Industry of the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the health benefits offered by paper towels, hot air hand dryers and Airjet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the average total bacteria on the fingerboard increased by 194% and on the handboard by 254%.
Drying hands with air conditioner increased the average number of bacteria on the fingerboard by 42% and on the handboard by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total bacteria levels decreased by an average of 76% on the finger pads and 77% on the palms.The scientists also conducted experiments to determine whether there was a possibility of cross-infection of other toilet users and the toilet environment due to the use of any drying method.
Airjet air dryers, which expel air from the car at speeds of 180 meters per second (650 km/h), are capable of inhaling microorganisms from the device and potentially contaminating bathroom users and the bathroom environment up to 2 meters away.
Using a hot hand dryer disperses microorganisms to an additional 0.25 m of dryer.
Hand-washing paper did not show any spread of microorganisms.In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt examined various methods of hand drying.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after drying the hands:
There are different types of hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towels.
Hand washing with disinfectant towels while traveling can be an alternative to soap and water.
Alcoholic disinfectants must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis (in 1846) discovered its effectiveness in preventing disease in a hospital setting.
There are a number of electronic devices that use feedback to remind healthcare workers to wash their hands.
One study showed a reduction in infection rates with their use.
Medical handwashing, using sufficient amounts of soap and water or a laxative, and washing each part of the hands for at least 15 seconds.
And the hands shall be joined together, and the fingers shall be joined together.
If there is a patch and fabric under the nails, it is best to use a hairbrush to clean it.
Since microbes remain in the water and on the hands, it is important to rinse properly and then dry with a clean towel.
After drying, a paper towel should be used to close the tap (and open any exit doors if necessary).
This prevents re-infection of the hands through such surfaces.
The purpose of handwashing in healthcare facilities is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms (""microbes") and prevent the spread of the virus.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that handwashing is at an unacceptable level in most healthcare settings, with many doctors and nurses consistently forgetting to wash their hands before contacting patients, causing transmission of microorganisms.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple tasks can reduce the rate of catheter-associated blood infections by up to 66%.The World Health Organization has published an article to demonstrate standard hand washing and proper hand sanitization practices in healthcare sectors.
The draft hand hygiene guidelines prepared by the Health Agency can be found on the website of the agency, which is publicly available.
A related review study was conducted by Whitby et al.
If necessary to prove compliance, commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization recommends "five situations" for hand washing:
After contact with blood/body fluids
Before disinfection, and
After care of the patient, adding chemical disinfectants to soap (soaps that are "medical" or "antibacterial") helps to disinfect the handwash.
"Such lethal measures are probably optimal before surgical procedures or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly prevalent. ""Cleaning"" a person's hands for surgery requires a tap of water that can be opened and closed without the need to touch the hands, chlorhexidine or iodine detergent, sterile hand towels to dry the hands after washing, and a sterile brush for layering and another sterile towel for cleaning under the nails".
All jewelry must be put away.
This procedure involves washing the hands and wrists to the elbow for two to six minutes.
It is not necessary to massage it for very long (ten minutes).
And when thou washest thy hands, thou shalt not put water upon thy hands.
After the hands are washed, the hands are dried with a sterile hand sanitizer and the surgical cloth is covered.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after touching a sick person.
In relation to the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it has been shown that the main benefit of washing hands is achieved in only 20% of the initial wash time and continuing to wash further at 35%, with a slight additional benefit.
Washing with plain soap led to a threefold increase in the rate of bacterial infection transmission to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap.Comparing alcohol-based hand-washing with hand-washing with antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds showed that hand-washing with alcohol reduced bacterial infection by 26 percent more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers at reducing the H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores.Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care facilities can include training staff on washing, increasing access to alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and written and oral reminders for staff.
More research is needed to determine which of these interventions is most effective in different healthcare facilities.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as an affordable and essential tool for achieving optimal hygiene and even proper nutrition.
However, the lack of water, soap or safe handwashing supplies in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes achieving universal handwashing practices a challenge.
For example, in rural Africa hand washing taps near private or public toilets are scarce, although there are inexpensive options for constructing hand washing facilities.
However, low rates of handwashing can partly be the result of established habits rather than the lack of soap or water.
Encouraging and supporting handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to long-term behavioural change in the population.
Monitoring and evaluation are essential for effective functioning.
"A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in increasing handwashing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns were less effective.An example of promoting handwashing in schools is the ""Three-Star Policy"" by UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps, such as ensuring that students wash their hands with soap in addition to complying with other hygiene requirements".
After achieving minimum grades, schools can be promoted from one star to ultimately three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of a handwashing campaign's promotional activities aimed at reducing childhood morbidity and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that strives to transform behaviour.During the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the use of handwashing emojis.
Few studies have considered the overall impact of handwashing cost-effectiveness in developing countries in relation to DALYs.
However, one study found that promoting handwashing with soap is much more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
"The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for people with vulnerable conditions such as new mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first introduced in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, who was ""the founder of modern nursing"" in England".
At the time, most people believed that infections were caused by bad smells, which they called miasmas.
In the 1980s, the spread of foodborne and healthcare-associated infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote active hand hygiene as an important practice for preventing the onset of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 global COVID-19 pandemic raised awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing for the prevention of such infectious diseases.
"For example, posters with the content ""Direct handwashing techniques"" were installed alongside the sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany".
The phrase "to withdraw from" something means to declare one's unwillingness to accept responsibility or share in it.
It originates from a passage in the Gospel of Matthew where Pontius Pilate refuses to crucify Jesus Christ, but has found wider use in some English conversations.
"In Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"", Lady Macbeth unconsciously repeatedly shakes her hands to remove the stain, which represents her conscience for the crimes she has committed and forcing her husband to commit. """
It has also been shown that people wash their hands more often than others after reminding or thinking about immoral acts and are more concerned about the use of washing and hand washing.
"Additionally, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such care are less likely to participate in other ""cleansing"" compensatory measures, such as volunteering".
Religions prescribe hand washing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, the use of water without soap to wash hands, is part of ritual hand washing that is depicted in many religions including Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism and the Vedic scriptures in Judaism, Lawu in Christianity and Wazu in Islam. Religions recommend hand washing, especially after certain acts.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam recommend washing hands after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after every meal.
Workplace risk control for COVID-19
Workplace risk control for COVID-19 means the use of occupational health and safety practices to control risks and prevent the onset of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate control of workplace hazards depends on the work environment and the job function and is variable based on the risk assessment of sources of exposure, severity of disease in the community, and risk factors for each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations have a minimum level of occupational contact with the general public and other coworkers, and these occupations are recommended to take minimum precautions to prevent infection, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if sick, wearing masks, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the workplace.
Including those with moderate risk occupations, those who do not require close or close contact with suspected or infected COVID-19 individuals may be at risk due to direct contact with the general public or international travel.
This includes staff who are in contact with the general public in spaces such as schools, high-density workplaces, and some large retail stores.
Risk control for this group, in addition to initial infection prevention measures, includes ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneezing protection and access to personal protective equipment to deal with an infected person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers health care workers who are exposed to people suspected of COVID-19 to be at high risk, which can be increased to a very high risk if aerosol generating procedures are used or samples taken from people suspected or infected with COVID-19 are taken and processed.
Among the occupational hazard controls that are appropriate for these workers are engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilated rooms and occupational personal protective equipment.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have multiple effects on the workplace.
Employees may not be at work because of illness, the need to care for others, or fear of being exposed to illness.
Business models can change, both in terms of the goods being demanded and in terms of how these goods are received (such as shopping outside rush hours or through on-site delivery or ride-hailing services).
Finally, shipping goods from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 can be problematic.A preparedness and response plan for infectious disease can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans consider the level of risk associated with different workplaces and occupational tasks, including sources of exposure to disease, risk factors in the social and domestic environment, and risk factors for each worker individually, including exposure to a chronic disease.
The plan also identifies the appropriate control practices necessary to prevent these risks and alternative plans for situations that may occur following an outbreak.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be implemented taking into account national or local recommendations.
The goals for responding to the outbreak include reducing transmission among employees, protecting those at higher risk from comorbid diseases, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse impacts on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community, where businesses are located, affects the responses received.
The hazard control hierarchy is a framework widely used to maintain workplace health and safety by grouping hazard controls according to the extent of impact.
Where it is not possible to eliminate COVID-19 risks, engineering controls followed by administrative controls and ultimately personal protective equipment are among the most effective control methods.
Engineering controls are to isolate employees from work-related hazards without relying on employee behavior, which can be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative controls are changes that are made to policies or procedures that employees or employees must follow.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less effective than administrative and engineering controls but can prevent some risks.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the risk they pose to staff, properly installed (e.g. medical masks), used continuously and regularly, inspected, serviced, replaced and, if necessary, opened, cleaned and reinstalled or discarded to prevent infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), occupations with the lowest level of occupational contact with the public or other coworkers are at lower risk.
Precautions for disease prevention recommended to individuals in all occupational fields include regular and complete hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if ill, wearing respiratory masks and, of course, covering the mouth when coughing or sneezing, access to paper towels and trash cans, preparing for remote communication or irregular working hours if necessary, encouraging employees to use other tools and equipment, and having a regular schedule for cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a critical step in protecting employees, customers, clients and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until the fever, symptoms of fever, and any other symptoms resolve, at least 24 hours after stopping the use of antifreeze or symptom-modifying medications, and that a more flexible policy on medication leave be established to allow employees to stay home to care for sick family members, and that all employees be informed of the new policy.
According to the OSHA announcement, medium-risk occupations include occupations that require frequent contact and relatively close proximity to others within six feet (1.8 meters) and it is not clear whether the respondents are COVID-19-infected, but may be SARS-CoV-2-infected due to continuous presence in the community or international travel to a location where COVID-19 has been reported.
This includes personnel who are in contact with the general public, such as those in schools, busy workplaces and some large retail spaces. Engineering controls for this group and the groups most at risk include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation rates, installation of physical barriers such as plastic scent drop shields and installation of ride-hailing service clinics for customers. Procedural controls for these groups and groups most affected include the use of equipment such as: encouraging sick workers to stay at home, encouraging the replacement of routine meetings with virtual contact, creating variable working hours, cancelling unnecessary travel to places where COVID-19 is most prevalent, setting up workplace contact planning, providing a minimum of training on the importance of protective hands and other protective equipment, providing a safe and effective workplace to meet COVID-19 risk, providing training and training to staff who are at risk of exposure to COVID-19 and providing adequate hands-on and hands-on safety measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 exposure.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an aircraft, appropriate control measures can be taken to protect staff and other passengers, such as isolating the person from the attack and maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet, assigning a crew member to the person, providing a face mask to the person, and asking them to cover their mouth and nose with a towel when sneezing or coughing.
Cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when serving a sick passenger or touching bodily secretions or surfaces that may be contaminated and use other personal protective equipment if possible if the sick passenger has fever, frequent coughs or shortness of breath.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in hospital waste bags, contaminated surfaces cleaned and disinfected after use. For commercial shipments, including those transported by cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk control includes such things as preventing travel in case of illness, self-isolation and prompt notification to the ship's medical center if fever or other symptoms are observed while on board.
Ideally, follow-up treatment should be done in an isolated cabin.The CDC recommends that schools and child care centers, regardless of the extent of community outbreaks, be closed for a short period of time for cleaning and disinfection because an infected person may have been in the school building.
When the rate of social transmission is low or moderate, social distancing strategies such as cancelling camps, gatherings and other gatherings such as face-to-face instruction or singing classes or dining in cafeterias, increasing table spacing, changing start and end times, limiting the presence of unnecessary clients, and using a separate health office for children with influenza-like symptoms can help.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, long-term school closures should be considered.The CDC believes there are few direct health risks for law enforcement personnel who perform their daily activities.
Law enforcement officers who must contact people with COVID-19 infection or suspicion are advised to follow the same procedures as emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If a close contact occurred during the period of fear of disease, employees should disinfect their seat belts and work equipment before reuse with a spray or household towel and follow workplace standards regarding the maintenance and disposal of used PPE and the storage and washing of dirty clothing.
OSHA believes that certain employees in health care and nursing are at high or high risk.
High-risk occupations such as healthcare providers, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to infected or suspected COVID-19 patients.
If staff use aerosol generating procedures, or take samples from suspected or infected COVID-19 patients, these cases are at very high risk of transmission.
Aerosol-generating procedures include tubing, measures to reduce cough, bronchoscopy, some dental examinations and surgeries, or invasive sampling.
High-risk mortuary jobs include those where a person must prepare the remains of people who were suspected or infected with COVID-19 after their death; these tasks are considered high-risk if autopsy is performed on the corpse.Additional engineering controls should be considered for these risk groups, including isolation rooms for patients who are suspected or infected with COVID-19, especially when aerosol generators are being performed.
In some sanitary and cold-room environments, special negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate.
Samples should be transported with Biological Defense Level 3 precautions in mind.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that new patients be placed in isolation waiting areas based on whether they are suspected of COVID-19. OSHA recommends that those working within 6 feet of patients or people suspected of SARS-CoV-2 and those performing aerosol-generating procedures wear medical masks in addition to other personal protective equipment.
In the United States, as part of a comprehensive and documented respiratory protection program that includes face-to-face testing, training and medical examination, N95 respiratory masks that are NIOSH-approved or better samples should be used.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve the comfort of workers.The World Health Organization does not recommend the use of supplemental coverings, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted primarily through body excretions.
The World Health Organization recommends surgical masks for screening starting point personnel.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that those who collect, store, or transfer respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-generating procedure use surgical masks, protective eyeglasses, face shields, masks, and gloves.
If an aerosol-generating method is used, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 mask.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, the World Health Organization recommends minimizing the need for personal protective equipment through the following measures: telemedicine (remediation), placing physical barriers such as transparent clinics, allowing access to the COVID-19 patient's room only to those directly involved in care, using PPE only for essential tasks, using a medical mask and not wearing it while caring for multiple patients with the same disease, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of PPE, and finally encouraging people without symptoms to wear a regular mask.

Title Line: [Covid-19] Easing the burden and preparing for the future
Date/time of posting: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
Licensing: CC0: which rights are not reserved
We find ourselves in interesting situations this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that defines the global interconnectedness of human beings and our responsibilities towards each other.
This is an unprecedented challenge, but we certainly know that our best response is to rely on the sense of solidarity, collaboration and social responsibility that lies at the heart of this organization.
The empathy and care we have seen through email, phone calls and chat among all our colleagues shows how lucky we are to be working with such amazing people.
I am very grateful and proud to have such colleagues as you.
Last week, someone in my position shared with me his gratitude for our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to now turn to Wikipedia and how powerful a symbol it is for these critical resources to remain online and accessible to all.
Your efforts make this possible, whether you help keep the sites running or employees get their paychecks or keep our community safe.
Now more than ever, the world needs the information Wikipedia provides.
Now is the moment when not only what we do, but how we do it will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in it, there will be several significant changes in the way we work together from next week.
Our work transitions and schedules
As Robin mentioned earlier, members of Team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the days and months ahead.
In this conversation, we considered what we thought was the appropriate response to the problem we were facing and the best way to maintain effective and sustainable company efficiency.
We want to reduce the tension and support our mission in the long run.
If you need to call again, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
Until further notice, our daily work schedule is expected to be approximately 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week.
We do not declare a state of lockdown - if you are able to work longer hours as usual, the mission can benefit from your help.
However, the world is currently unpredictable and whether you have to provide care and food for your loved ones or visit a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't record your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
It doesn't need to be mentioned, but we'll mention it again.
Which medication leave or PTO is not necessary - just tell your manager and help your team review schedules and time allocations to ensure that important areas of work are covered.
(If your COVID-19 test result is positive, please inform Brian at T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can assist you with providing support and ensure management is paying adequate attention to your situation.)
The salaries of those who work on an hourly basis will be supplemented.
We have already made and once again commit to honoring our commitments to our contractors and our hourly colleagues.
Everyone should receive a salary based on normal working hours under normal conditions.
This includes you if you are unable to work because of illness.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to challenge their stress with the world around them.
What we do can be incredibly valuable, especially at times like this when we're going through it.
Again, we remind you that this is about taking care of yourself.
Our request is that you contact your manager, so we know what to expect and can adjust ourselves accordingly.
Some tasks are considered essential.
These are things that should be continued.
SRE companies, HR Ops, Trust & Safety and fundraising teams (among others) do critical work that may need further support.
We will initiate a process across all units to evaluate current objectives and focus on supporting whatever is necessary to accomplish this mission.
There is a lot of work to do, we will focus only on the most important projects.
Lowering the work rhythm now does not cause later damage.
"We do not intend to ""double down"" the time to compensate for the delay once the pandemic is over".
You will not be expected to work harder to meet deadlines, which are now unreasonable.
We acknowledge that circumstances have changed and will act to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What happens to APP?
To adapt to the reality and expectations of the new working day, we are going to change the timeframe for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Agenda.
We plan to expand our 2019-2020 program to allow more time to budget and allow employees to prioritize basic tasks, taking care of themselves and their loved ones, while those who need or want to work have a lighter work schedule in the coming weeks.
This extended timetable reduces the current workload for planning and pressure on the entire organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and will brief the delegates and teams on the next steps as soon as we receive approval.
We thank the APP team for their leadership.
Workplace conditions, hazards and cleanliness
Last week we learned that one of our staff living in SF may have been exposed to COVID-19.
However, as a precaution, we have employed an anti-virus cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces as well as the lobby and the locker rooms that end up on the ground floor.
The building implements its own care protocols by using products that protect the immunity of its occupants.
We feel relieved that the office will be fully ready for our return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC residents.
Last week, our DC office moved to a completely remote location in accordance with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of my colleagues in New York City know, we are in negotiations to rent a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are experiencing remote working for the first time.
Our long-term colleagues should be aware that changes may occur and I need to make a few recommendations:
The duration of the sessions is limited to a maximum of one or two hours.
If you need longer sessions, consider splitting the session into several days.
Define the meeting clearly, have a meeting schedule and send in the material to be read in advance.
Make video calling a default to facilitate collaboration and live communication with tools like Google Docs and Zoom.
In all meetings, have a leader who oversees the discussion of questions and follows the list of speakers, and one to take notes (or collaborate on taking notes).
If you need a comfortable headset, email technical support.
Use your welfare refund to buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack and talk to your colleagues about work distribution
The HR operations team reviews ergonomics guidance and focused seminars to support increased work distribution across the foundation.
Last week, we urged all social welfare recipients to cancel Wikimedia-sponsored public events, such as edits, until the end of the pandemic is declared by the World Health Organization.
We inform them that we understand that your request for cancellation and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete the agreed grant activities and no one will be penalized for delaying or changing those objectives.
In the coming week, we will provide more tips on Wikimania and other local and thematic community conferences.
It turns out that the general public is upset about the break but feels reassured that they can focus on their social activities, Wikimedia and other ways, with transparency.
CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor impact and track our interactions with them.
Keep up to date on COVID-19 issues
We will send an invitation for a special staff meeting for next Thursday at 14:00 UTC.
We will use this opportunity to share supplemental updates, answer your questions and contact each other.
We are in this together and we are ready to help in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find information via this email and visit the Office Wiki for all other essential information regarding COVID-19.
CRT helps these pages to be updated and all information kept together.
We are also making every effort to communicate regularly with employees in the countries most affected.
If you have any questions regarding travel, events, a mainstream workflow, or a coverage challenge, or any other issue you need help with, please contact and cooperate with CRT as soon as possible.
We are available to help provide support and to communicate, as needed.
If you know of a confidential or sensitive matter, please email Bryan Judan - Global Operations Manager, International HR.
Any of these changes should not be considered as abandoning work and commitments.
Rather, they are now somehow demonstrating that our work and commitments must adapt to new forms that have not been experienced before.
These are the stages we believe are essential to supporting each other in order to continue to work, to inject the support that our movement needs and to support the world that depends on it.
Our plans will wait for the right time.
Now is the time to support each other and create space for the important work that we will have in the weeks and possibly months ahead.
We need you all to do this, and so we ask you all to take care of yourselves and your families so that you are in the best possible shape when needed.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT department (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and other members of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2B (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface (cell membrane) of lung cells, blood vessels, heart, lungs, and intestines.
ACE2 counters the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme by reducing the amount of angiotensin 2 and increasing the amount of angiotensin 1-7, making it an effective drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angiotensin-2 converting enzyme contains a metallic enzyme with a nucleus element that is localized on the surface of intracellular and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the M2 domain of the n-terminal peptidase and the C-terminal amino acid transporter domain of the cluster of cluster.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein with an enzyme-active domain that is localized to the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the membrane domain by another enzyme called shadase, and the resulting protein solution is released into the bloodstream and eventually eliminated in the form of urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 binds to the cell membrane of primarily porous lung cells, small intestinal enterocytes, intravascular cells, and smooth muscle cells of arteries in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE antagonist.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin one into angiotensin two, which is a vasodilator.
ACE2 instead separates the carboxylic-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin two (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can cause the cleavage of a number of other peptides including / ((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
ACE2 also regulates the passage of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 from the membrane and is involved in Hartnap disease.
ACE2 as a membrane-permeable protein serves as the main entry point into the cell for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63 (the virus that causes SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, the binding of the S1 spike protein in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the ACE2 enzyme domain on the cell surface leads to endosytosis and transmission of both the virus and the enzyme to endosomes in the cells.
This entry process also requires preparation of protein S by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is being investigated as a potential treatment. This led to the hypothesis that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional associations and surveillance agencies have recommended continuation of ACE inhibitor criteria and ARB treatment.
"A baseline review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that ""use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls""".
"Additionally, ""it also reduced the risk of chest pain in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, patients who had a higher risk of chest pain, especially patients with stroke and heart failure".
"Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced mortality from asthma, although the results were less potent relative to overall asthma risk"."
Human ACE2 neutrophils (rhACE2), a novel treatment for acute lung injury, have been shown to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours, with an onset of action of 30 minutes plus a 24-hour period of action.
Various findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those who are resistant to classical inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS inhibitors) or in patients with long-term angiotensin II.Injection of rhACE2 has been studied in clinical studies for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
"COVID-19 B programs are mobile phone software applications designed to help track calls in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e., the process of identifying individuals ("Contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person".
Many apps were introduced or developed with official government support in some regions and territories.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of communication tracking applications.
There have been concerns about privacy, particularly regarding systems that work on the basis of tracking the geolocation of mobile app users.
Less intrusive options include using Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would add capability to support these Bluetooth-based apps directly on Android and iOS platforms.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has launched an app that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is in use in over 200 Chinese cities.In Singapore, a software called Tris Togdhar is used.
"The app was developed by the Local Information Technology Association, released as open source and delivered to the government.North Macedonia launched a Bluetooth-based mobile app called ""StopKorona!"" to track contacts of potentially infected people, allowing for rapid response by health authorities".
The software was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracing app was in an advanced stage of development and would be available for deployment within a few weeks.Similar programs are planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid"")".
Australia and New Zealand are considering developing software based on Singapore's TRS software and the Bluetooth protocol.Russia plans to design its own geo-fence software for COVID-19 positive patients living in Moscow to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, has listed a number of potential practical problems in application-based systems, including false positives and inefficiencies if the application is used only for a small segment of the population.
"Apple, in response to concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious ""coronavirus"" applications, has imposed restrictions on organizations that can add coronavirus-related applications to the App Store, restricting this to ""official"" or authoritative organizations".
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy activists expressed concern about the use of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, particularly in relation to the dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic after the viral threat was eliminated.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
Organizations announced 8 conditions for government projects:
"Surveillance must be ""legal, necessary and proportionate""
The expansion of surveillance should end the historical ties.
The use of data should be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data security and anonymity must be maintained and this protection must be demonstrated by evidence.
Digital surveillance should not be used to exacerbate discrimination and marginalization;
Any sharing of data with third parties must be defined in law;
There should be safeguards against abuse and civil rights to hold abusers accountable;
"Sensible engagement by all ""relevant stakeholders"" will be required, including public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Computer Club for Chaos (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (ARASF) have also published a checklist".
The proposed Google/Apple plan intends to address the continuous surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism from their device operating system when it is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
Network-based tracking was confirmed in Israel.
Network-based solutions that access raw spatial data have potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data. A number of privacy systems have been developed that use central servers only for two-way communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to track calls.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile tracking data and card transaction data, and combines these to generate text message alerts to suspected infections.
In addition to using this information to alert potential audiences, the government has made location information publicly available, which was allowed due to sweeping changes in privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is made available to the public through a number of applications and websites.Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized systems and privacy-preserving systems.
As of April 6, 2020, details had not yet been released.
Privacy-based call tracking is a popular idea that has generated countless research since at least 2013.As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on appropriate privacy-based solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that includes both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol.Descentralized protocols include privacy-friendly tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), TCN temporary call count, FKA call event count, CEN), privacy-sensitive protocols, and mobile phone call tracking (PACT) mechanisms, among others.
In these protocols, personally identifiable data never leaves the machine and all tracking takes place on the machine.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has been developing SafePaths, a platform that uses privacy techniques when collecting and using location or intersection data to track COVID-19 outbreaks.
"This is based on research from the white paper ""Apps Gone Rogue: Privacy in an Epidemic"" that was published in March 2020.Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that is developing privacy technologies that were originally also developed at MIT Media Lab".
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to enable users to share sensitive location and identity data with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of this data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was formed by groups that revolved around what was essentially the same approach and broadly overlapping protocols, with the goal of reducing fragmentation and enabling global collaboration in tracking and warning programs - a key aspect to achieving widespread acceptance.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol used in the official government software open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS mobile operating systems, announced an innovation for contact tracking based on a combination of low-power Bluetooth technology and privacy-preserving encryption, which they claimed is privacy-preserving.
They also published specifications for the core technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be deployed in three phases:
The unveiling of new tools to empower governments to create official coronavirus tracking programs while maintaining privacy.
Direct integration of this functionality into iOS and Android; Google and Apple intend to distribute the system first through the OS update and then remove it in the same manner after the vulnerability is over.
Drug reuse (also known as drug recycling, re-profiling, re-use, or therapeutic recycling) is the reuse of an approved drug to treat a disease or medical condition different from what the drug was originally designed for.
This is an area of scientific research currently being pursued to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other areas of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and plasma injection of recovered individuals. SARS-CoV-2 has 66 drug-eluting proteins, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites provides a reasonable project for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are the papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S (S), and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussain A.A. and colleagues studied several sample compounds and optimized and analyzed them for their structural similarity to the similar drug with the highest approval rate with the goal of accelerating the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in their preclinical study, which is recommended in a clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug used to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, the World Health Organization announced that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are the four drugs being studied as part of a joint clinical study.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the New York State trials on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on March 24.On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency use authorization (EUA).
This treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is only authorized as an experimental treatment for emergency treatment in hospitalized patients who are unable to receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not been established.
Doctors have said they use it when "there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Vytautas is conducting research on the use of chloroquine in combination with rice, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Extensive studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
"Chinese clinical studies in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that Favivir was ""completely effective""".
On average, 4 days, the test result for 35 patients in the shingles was negative, while the duration of disease in 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 patients with chest and hip infections, half of the subjects received faviparovir and half received omefenovir.

According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has offered the Trump administration to purchase the drug, which may be less effective in severe cases where the virus has already replicated.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or people trying to have children.
"A study on lupinavir/ritonavir (Caltra), a combination of lupinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that ""no benefit was observed""".
These drugs are designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is working to modify the drug and find a compound that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.There is criticism in the scientific community about the shift in resources towards the use of psychoactive drugs, especially those produced for AIDS.
The World Health Organization has included lupinavir/ritonavir in the international joint trial.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection.Gilead Sciences later discovered that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in in vitro conditions against several viruses including phylloxera, Nomo, Paramix and Corona.
One problem with antiviral therapy is the creation of resistance through mutations that can lead to disease and more severe strain transmission.
Some preliminary pre-test studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance.Several clinical studies are underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one for people with mild disease levels and one for people with severe disease levels.
Three clinical studies for the injection of vitamin C to hospitalized and critically ill individuals due to COVID-19 are underway; two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled trial (Italy).

Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of calcitonin in reducing inflammation and lung problems in patients suffering from mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, called COLCORONA, will target 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 but experience mild symptoms of the disease that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who are not using an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticorps have been tested in Italy.
Heparin is widely used to treat patients due to its low molecular weight, and has led the Italian Medicines Agency to issue a recommendation for its use.
A multicentre study of 300 patients investigating the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced on 14 April in Italy.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, significant scientific attention has been focused on the use of approved antiviral drugs that have been approved for previous outbreaks of viruses such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin is recommended according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19.
Omifenovir: recommended for treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of China's guidelines
Some antibiotics that are recognized as potential treatments for COVID-19 include:

Tests were also conducted in Italy and China, and you can see Tuselizumab #COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothesized vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical studies, several efforts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 to be available in less than 18 months.
Five proposed vaccines were in Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was diagnosed in December 2019.
A major worldwide outbreak in 2020, which led to significant investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using the published genomes to develop potential vaccines to combat SARS-CoV-2.
As stated in April, CEPI's guidelines for vaccine development are: speed, production capacity, scale, and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of the platform that has advanced in the first phase of immunity studies include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (stage one enhancer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral carrier (developer phase one and proposed vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 carrier)
According to scientists at the Epidemic Preparedness Innovation Alliance (CEPI) in April, a total of 115 vaccines are in early development, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and 37 vaccines have been announced but little information is available to the public (presumably in the planning or design phase).
Phase I-II testing assesses early immunity and immunity development and is generally randomized, placebo-controlled, and performed in multiple locations, while determining a more effective and accurate dose.
Phase 3 trials typically involve more participants, including a control group and a vaccine efficacy trial for prevention as well as monitoring for adverse events at optimal doses.
"Of the 79 proposed vaccines currently in active development (approved in early April 2020), 74 vaccines have not yet reached the human evaluation stage (still in ""preclinical"" research").
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating a potential molecular clump vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune system response.

On or about March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it was partnering with Novavax.
In the development and production of a vaccine.
The partners announced plans to continue preclinical trials and phase one clinical studies through July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even with rapid follow-up procedures, vaccine production would take at least about one and a half to two years.
On March 12, 2020, Medico, a biotechnology company based in Quebec City, announced the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The vaccine is in the laboratory research phase and human trials are planned for July or August 2020.
"Later that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac ""a large amount of money for allocated access to the COVID-19 vaccine"" and faced opposition from the German government".
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
A voluntary mRNA-based vaccine, called BNT162, which is currently in pre-clinical studies, is expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Taxis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that they would have the results of preclinical trials in April 2020 and that their final vaccine sample could be tested on human subjects.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) allocated US$4.9 million to a consortium of COVID-19 vaccine research involving the Institut Pasteur, Thames Biosciences (Vienne, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the combined investments in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine to US$29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
Russian health authorities announced on 20 March 2020 that scientists had begun testing on six different vaccine samples.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-reinforcing RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine sample was made within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Government of Canada announced that it had allocated $275 million to 96 research projects on medical response to COVID-19, including large vaccination projects at Canadian companies and universities such as Medico and the University of Saskatchewan.
"At the same time, the Government of Canada announced a $192 million appropriation specifically for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, along with plans to create a ""National Vaccine Bank"" with several new vaccines that could be used in the event of other coronavirus outbreaks".
"On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on the trial of PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that ""MNA receipt of subunit SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines has caused strong antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice] that were evident 2 weeks after immunization"."
On 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo's Faculty of Pharmaceutical Design announced a DNA-based vaccine sample as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA is engineered to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which may stimulate the body's immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities shared resources for access to IBM cloud computing, along with cloud computing resources from Hult Packard, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond prevention.
Another randomized trial in Australia is looking to enroll 4,170 healthcare workers.
It is possible that vaccines under development may not be safe or effective.
Preliminary research to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines using animal models specific to COVID-19, including transgenic ACE2 mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human mammals, also indicates the need for Biosafety Level-3 measures for the control of live viruses and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested on animal samples.
As of 2020, there is no protective treatment or vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to articles published in 2005 or 2006, the introduction and development of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When MERS became widespread, it was believed that existing research on SARS may provide a useful model for vaccine development and treatment of MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that completed Phase I clinical studies and three others are underway, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory that claims the virus responsible for COVID-19 is known and a vaccine is already available.
The patent references given by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other types of coronavirus such as SARS.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, diarrhea, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
From exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms, it usually takes about 5 days, but may vary from 2 to 14 days.
Although the majority of cases have mild symptoms, some develop viral thrush and multi-organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
An additional 568,000 people recovered.The virus was initially spread between people through direct contact, usually by the following droplets from coughing, sneezing or sneezing.
When these droplets are produced during weathering, they usually stick to the ground or to surfaces rather than traveling long distances.
People may become infected by touching a surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive for up to 72 hours on surfaces.
The disease is most contagious within the first three days after onset of symptoms, although there may be spread before symptoms and in later stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is rRT-PCR from a biofilm substrate.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations on public use of masks vary, with some authorities opposing, some recommending, and some making it mandatory.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People who are infected with the virus may have no symptoms or show flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, or shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, pain or persistent pressure on the chest, confusion, difficulty waking, and bluing of the face or lips; if these symptoms are present, immediate medical attention is recommended.
Sometimes, symptoms of the upper respiratory system such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be observed.
Digestive symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been observed in different percentages.
Some infected people in China had only chest tightness and a choking state.
In some people, the disease may lead to chest and pelvis, multiple organ failure, and death.
This period is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but the range of transformation may vary between two to 14 days.
97.5% of people develop symptoms up to 11.5 days after infection.Reports suggest that not all infected cases necessarily have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic vectors in transmission is not yet fully understood, although preliminary evidence suggests that they may play a role in the spread of the virus.
The proportion of infections that do not show symptoms is currently unknown and is under study, according to the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began including asymptomatic cases in its daily case statistics from 1 April.Of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both vomiting and mouthwash carry a high amount of pathogen.
Speaking aloud releases more microdots than normal speech.
A study in Singapore showed that a cough without protection can lead to the ejection of respiratory droplets up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually suspended in the air, the National Academy of Sciences said transmission is possible through this as well, and samples of the air outside the room of individuals also showed positive samples of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as tubal and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause airborne respiratory secretions to be released, resulting in airborne discharge.
Although there is concern that the disease may be transmitted through the use of contaminants, the likelihood is very low. The most contagious case is when the person has symptoms, although transmission is possible before symptoms appear, but very low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says that while the ease of spreading the disease is not entirely clear, one person generally infects two to three others.The virus remains on surfaces for hours.
Specifically, it has been observed that the virus is detectable up to a day on a canvas, over three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours on copper, with a detectability of 99%.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also useful if used correctly: soap products remove and inactivate the protective layer of the virus, as well as isolating the virus from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chloroxydine glucant (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective.In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken at a median interval of two days after hospitalization.
In 5 of the 6 patients, the first sample had the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day.
Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel respiratory coronavirus syndrome that was first observed in three people with chest and hip infections in Wuhan who had low blood oxygen levels and respiratory problems.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by ordinary soap, which destroys its retaining bubble in the produced floor.COVID-19 is closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
The lungs are the most susceptible organism to COVID-19, as the virus enters the host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor most abundant in the alveolar cells of the two lungs.
"The virus uses a specific glycoprotein (peplomer) called a ""spike"" to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell".
Acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of hospital admissions in Wuhan, China, which is more common in severe illness.
The incidence of cardiovascular disease is high due to inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but damage to the heart muscle may be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and share the function of the heart.
High prevalence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thrombo-embolicity (25%) has been observed in ICU patients with COVID-19 and may be related to poor prognosis.Autopsies of people who died from COVID-19 show extensive alveolar degeneration (DAD) and inflammatory lesions involving lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-CoV-2 tends to have ACE2-expressing mucous cells, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of generalized hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was shown that GM-CM-secreting pathogenic T cells are associated with IL-6-secreting inflammatory monocytes activity and severe lung pathology among COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic seizures have also been reported in autopsies.
The World Health Organization has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the ion reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained from the nasal septum; however, nasal or urethral swabs may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but two blood samples are required, taken two weeks apart, and the results have a low instantaneous value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence, so laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect infection based on the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody testing (which can detect active infections and whether a person has been infected in the past) was in development, but has not yet been widely used.
Chinese experience of the test has shown that its accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The US Food and Drug Administration approved the first point-of-care test in the United States on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month.The diagnostic procedures published by Zongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for diagnosing infections based on clinical features and infectious diseases.
Bipolar polypolar glass matte coccurses with a peripheral, asymmetrical, and posterior distribution are common in early infection.
Pulmonary filling, abnormal structures (thickening of the lobes and variable filling of the air sacs) and pulmonary density are signs of disease progression.
Little information is available on the microscopic and pathophysiological effects of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings from the autopsy include:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, extraocular pressure, pulmonary stabilization, and pulmonary emptying
There are four types of viral angina:
Mild chest and pelvis: pulmonary enlargement, pneumocytosis, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic artery and giant squamous cell formation
Severe pneumonia: widespread alveolar damage (DAD) with alveolar exudate spread.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and low blood oxygen levels.
Treatment of chest and pelvis: regulation of secretions in the air sacs cavities and interpulmonary fibrosis
Blood: DIC; leucorethroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, observing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a towel when you cough or sneeze, and if no towel is available, cough or sneeze in your mouth.
Hand hygiene is recommended after sneezing or coughing.
To limit transmission by asymptomatic carriers, the CDC has recommended the use of face masks in public places.Social distancing strategies are intended to reduce contact with the public by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.
Distancing procedures also include people staying at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart.
"There is no known effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19. Since the shortest time to get a vaccine will not be earlier than 2021, a key issue in COVID-19 control is the effort to reduce the peak of disease, or so-called ""clearing the curve"".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands for 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating or after wiping the nose, after sneezing and coughing.
In addition, it is recommended that consumers use alcohol with at least 60% alcohol content, but only when soap and water are not readily available.The WHO offers two formulations for local production for areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available.
In this formula, antimicrobial activity is due to ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to help destroy bacterial spores in alcohol. ""It is not an active hand sanitizer""".
Glycerol was added as a moisture absorber.
People are monitored with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, supplemental oxygen, and support for other vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they are carriers use a simple face mask.
Extradermembrane oxygen delivery (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory distress, but its benefits are still being studied.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve the immune system.
Supportive treatments may be effective for people with mild symptoms and in the early stages of infection.The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Chinese National Health Commission (CNC) have issued recommendations for care of people hospitalized due to COVID-19.
Special care and pulmonary specialists in the United States have compiled the treatment recommendations of various agencies in a free resource called IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
Some medical professionals prefer the use of paracetamol to ibuprofen for initial treatment to relieve symptoms.
To minimize the risk of virus transmission, caution should be exercised, especially in treatment environments where suspended particles may be produced during procedures, processes such as piping and the use of a manual respirator.
For health care professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an AIIR (Aerial Infection Isolation Room) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne infection control.
Recommended items include: PPE, respiratory system or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. If available, respirators (instead of face masks) are preferred.
N95 respiratory filters have been approved for industrial use, but the FDA has only authorized the use of these masks for the approved emergency use situation (EUA).
They are designed to protect particles suspended in air such as dust, but their efficacy against a specific biological agent for uses not listed on the label is not guaranteed.
The CDC recommends the use of face shields, or as a last resort, home masks when masks are not available.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical ventilation or similar, but a percentage of those infected require it.
The type of respiratory assistance that patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 require is currently being studied in people in hospitals, and evidence has shown that using a high pressure tube or semi-positive air pressure can prevent an entopation or tubing into the respiratory system.
Whether either leads to the same benefit for people with severe disease is unknown.
Some doctors prefer to continue with invasive mechanical ventilator machine at the time of access, as this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to long-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy.
Many developed countries lack adequate hospital beds, limiting the capacity of a health system to deal with the sudden rise in the number of COVID-19 cases that are severely in need of hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care wards, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized for COVID-19 were transferred to ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 progresses and oxygen delivery becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators, including high pressure control modes and PEEP, are used to maximize oxygen delivery while reducing the risk of lung damage associated with the respiratory system and pneumothorax.
High-pressure inlet (PEEP) may not be available in older ventilators.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are being seen in clinical studies.
Remdesivir has been the most effective case so far.
Although the development of a new drug may take until 2021, many of the drugs under testing have been proven for other uses or have already been approved in advanced trials.
Antiviral medication may be tested on people with severe disease.
The World Health Organization has recommended that volunteers participate in trials to determine the efficacy and immunity of potential medications.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted temporary authorization for convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is seriously or directly threatened.
It has not been subjected to the clinical studies needed to demonstrate immunity and efficacy for disease.
In February 2020, China introduced a mobile software to combat the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and identification number.
"The program is able to detect ""close contact"" and thus potential risk of infection using surveillance data".
Each user can check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is identified, the program not only recommends self-quarantine, but also notifies the local health authorities of the risk.Big data analysis of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infection cases and people who have been in contact with South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to track the phone records of people suspected of being infected with coronavirus.
This is done to quarantine and protect people who may have come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, for the purpose of research and prevention of the spread of the virus.
Russia implemented facial recognition technology to identify quarantine violators.
"Julio Galera, member of the Italian Regional Health Board, said that it was informed through mobile operators that ""40% of people go this way and that way anyway"."
The German government ran a recent 48-hour hackathon with over 42,000 participants.
Also, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, called for global solutions to the spread of coronavirus.
People in quarantine may experience anxiety, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, or fear of infection.
"The BBC, quoting Rory O'Connor, declared: ""More social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic crisis are a full-blown storm to the detriment of people's mental health and well-being""".
The disease may have a mild, mild or even asymptomatic period and is similar to diseases with common upper respiratory problems such as a common diarrhea.
Mild cases typically resolve within two weeks, while in severe cases recovery may take three to six weeks.
Based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be at higher risk of contracting COVID-19, although COVID-19 data is not yet available.In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause chest pains.
In severely infected individuals, COVID-19 may rapidly progress to acute respiratory syndrome (ARDs) leading to respiratory distress, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
COVID-19-related complications include seizures, abnormal clotting, and damage to the heart, lungs, and liver.
Blood clotting disorders, or specifically an increase in prothrombin time, were observed in 6% of those admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while abnormal pulmonary function was observed in 4% of this group.
In about 20 to 30% of people with COVID-19, their liver enzymes are elevated (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were in hospital admission.
However, in patients admitted to ICU, the median time between admission and death was 7 days.
In a study of early cases, the median time from the time of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a range of the metastasis range of 6 to 41 days.
In a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8% compared to 1.7% for women.
Postmortem tissue examinations of lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromycoxide exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic mutations were observed in pneumocytes.
The lung image was similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, the incidence of cardiac injury was attributed to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
In the United States, 89% of people admitted to hospitals had co-morbidities, according to March. The availability of treatment resources and the regional economy have not been ineffective in mortality rates.
Estimates of mortality from these conditions vary due to regional differences as well as methodological problems.
The lower number of mild cases leads to an overestimation of mortality.
However, the fact that deaths are caused by infections in the past could mean that the mortality rate is currently underestimated.
Individuals who smoke are 1.4 times more likely to have severe COVID-19 symptoms and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care compared to non-smokers.
Hong Kong Hospital officials noted a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in the number of people who had recovered from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
This may also lead to post-care syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether previous infection in people recovering from the disease would result in effective, long-term immunity.
Immunity appears likely based on the behaviour of other coronavirus, but there have been reports of people who have been reinfected after contracting COVID-19.
These are believed to worsen long-term infection rather than reinfection.
It is thought to be natural and of animal origin, transmitted via infectious vectors.
The exact origin is unknown, but the spread of infection was complementary to human-to-human transmission as of December 2019.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January 2020 announced the first date of onset of symptoms on 1 December 2019.
Official documents from the World Health Organization reported that the first symptoms of the disease were on December 8, 2019.
Several criteria are usually used to calculate the mortality rate.
These figures vary by region and over time, and vary based on frequency of testing, quality of health care system, treatment options, time elapsed since the outbreak began, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) allocated the ICD-10 Emergency Disease Vaccine U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and the U07.2 Vaccine for deaths from patients who were clinically or epidemiologically infected with COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the global case mortality rate as of April 17, 2020, is 6.9% (153822/22401191).
Figures vary by region. Other metrics include the mortality rate (CFR), which indicates people who were sick and died, and the infectious mortality rate (IFR), which indicates the percentage of infected (diagnosed or undiagnosed) cases who died from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to resolution.
Although not all patients produce antibodies, the presence of these antibodies in individuals indicates how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, in the small village of Castellione d'Adda, 80 (1.7%) of the 4,600 inhabitants died.
In Gangelet, the virus spread through carnival festivals and spread among young people, which reduced the mortality rate. However, not all COVID-19 deaths may be of this nature.
Furthermore, the German healthcare system is not immune to the reception and treatment of patients.
In the Netherlands, based on estimates from blood donors, about 3% of people may have antibodies.
69 people (0.004% of the population) have lost their lives to COVID-19.
The impact of pandemics and the associated mortality rates differ for men and women.
Mortality rates among men were higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk is for men in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is only 90 per cent.
In China, the mortality rate was 8.2% for men and 7.1% for women.
The underlying cause of this gender difference is not known, but behavioral and genetic factors may be a factor.
Immunological differences based on gender, lower smoking prevalence in women, and the incidence of co-morbidities in men, such as hypertension at younger ages than in women, may contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were male, and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government no longer tracks data on COVID-19 transmission through sexual intercourse.
Research shows that viral diseases such as Ebola, AIDS, influenza and SARS have different effects on women and men.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, who are more likely to contract the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for coronavirus, VI for virus and D for disease in English, and the 19 year mark marks the first case of infection with the virus: 31 December 2019.
The name of the virus was chosen based on global naming guidelines to prevent defamation, with the observation that it does not refer to a specific geographical area (e.g. China), or a specific species of animal or group of people.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2.
"Additionally, the WHO uses the term ""COVID-19 virus"" or ""COVID-19 virus"" in its public statements".
"Usually, ""coronavirus"" refers to both a virus and a disease".
"During the initial outbreak of the virus in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were known collectively as ""coronavirus"" and ""Wuhan coronavirus"".
In January 2020, the World Health Organization designated the disease 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCoV, according to the 2015 guidelines for the temporary toxicology of diseases and viruses by location.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard service chains, some digital factories are producing medical goods such as nasal swabs or ventilator parts.
For example, when a hospital in Italy urgently needed a ventilator valve and the supplier was unable to supply it, a local reverse-engineered startup produced 100 valves in one night.
After the initial COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, false and misleading information regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease appeared and quickly spread on the Internet.
It has been shown that humans are able to spread the virus to a number of other animals.
Research to find evidence of virus replication in pigs, ducks and piglets failed.
No drug or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is underway by government agencies, scientific groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the four existing antiviral compounds that have the highest hopes of effect.
No vaccine is available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine prototypes.
Because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells, previous research on SARS-CoV is useful.
Three vaccination strategies have been studied in this regard.
Initially, the goal of the researchers was to develop a complementary virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to stimulate a rapid immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, sub-vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to specific subunits of the virus.
In relation to SARS-CoV-2, research has focused on the S-spike protein, which helps the virus bind to the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (RNA or DNA vaccines, a new technique for promoting vaccination).
Experimental vaccines from each of these strategies must be tested for immunity and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical study of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge to the development of a vaccine for SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical studies are underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials for the treatment of malaria are currently being evaluated, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Newly developed antiviral drugs are largely the focus of Chinese research, with nine phase three clinical trials of Remdesivir in various countries completed in late April.
A dynamic clinical process for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine with the candidate drugs was underway as of April 2020. Several antiviral drugs available for the treatment of COVID-19 including Remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lupinavir/ritonavir and lupinavir/ritonavir with interferon beta are being evaluated.
As of March 2020, there is empirical evidence of efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical studies are underway in the United States, China, and Italy.Cloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, there have been calls for review of the research by other researchers.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that doubling this dose is extremely dangerous and can be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.Chinese procedures of the 7th edition include interferon, ribavirin orumifenovir for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are necessary for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in laboratory conditions.
After demonstrating inhibition of low-concentration SARS-CoV-2, nitasoxanide was recommended for further study in the body.Studies have shown that the initial synthesis of the protein spike with the intermembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
High-level studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have numerous limitations that prevent the medical community from accepting and testing these therapies without additional studies.Seltavivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in laboratory conditions and has no role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cyclone cytokine could be a problem in the later stages of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytocin storm properties.Tucylisomab was included in the treatment guidelines after a brief study by the National Health Commission of China.
After showing positive results in people with severe disease, it is undergoing a Phase 2 non-randomized trial at the national level in Italy.
Blood tests in combination with serum ferritin testing are used to detect cases of cytokine storm, to counteract such development of symptoms that are said to be the cause of death in many infected individuals.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA in 2017 based on a retrospective case study for the treatment of steroid-resistant cytokine release syndrome caused by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized or controlled evidence that tosilezomab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transmission of filtered antibodies and antibodies collected from the immune system of individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 to infected cases is currently being investigated as a non-vaccination method.
This strategy was tested for SARS without definitive results.
Viral neutralisation is the predicted mechanism by which passive antibody therapy can create a defensive agent against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as cytotoxicity and/or antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis are also possible.
Other types of passive antibody therapy, for example, the use of artificial monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
Production of serum from healthy individuals, including the fluid portion of recovered patients, and containing specific antibodies to the virus, can be increased for faster uptake.
Coronavirus-induced diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later died after becoming aware of the spread of the virus.
