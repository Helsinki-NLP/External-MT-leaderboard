Members of the Welsh Assembly are afraid they'll look like Muppet.
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are appalled by the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament  Member of the Welsh Parliament)
The proposal is based on the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that the title might provoke ridicule.
One Labour member said his group was concerned that it was rhyme with the Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: Twp means stupid in Welsh and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid party said the group as a whole was unhappy and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was moving forward with the name change with an open mind, but noted that the MWP is close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is now preparing legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: The final decision on the names of the members of the Welsh Assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves.
The Welsh Government's 2017 law gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals, where it received wide support for the option of calling the meeting the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of the Assembly Members, the Commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP variant gained the most support in the public debate.
The Assembly members are obviously proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus may be a concern for President Elin Jones, who is due to submit a legislative proposal within weeks.
The reform laws will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules for disqualifying members and a proposal for a system of committees.
The members of the Assembly shall vote on the question of their title in the course of the discussion of the new legislation.
The Macedonians will vote to change the country's name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum should resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to Greek territory, and has repeatedly protested against the country's EU and NATO membership requests.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to a plebiscite to change the name, has said he will not follow the vote.
But referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's are ringing as the churches in Harlem struggle to survive.
"The old people I spoke to say that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner", says Mr. Adams.
There's not one today.
He thinks the bar disappearance is understandable.
"People today meet in a different way", he says.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly go.
As for the churches, he's worried that the money from the sale of the property won't last as long as their representatives expect, and sooner or later they'll be right where they started.
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with people who are not helping the rest of the neighborhood's shrines.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white", he says, "and that's why soon the day will come when these churches will close completely, because it's unlikely that most of these people who move into these homes will become members of churches".
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became the Black Metropolis  Metropolitan Community in 1870, ten years later St. Martin.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation whose services were held nearby.
St. Martin's took over the Black Congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who was leading a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping boulevard in Harlem, who refused to employ or promote blacks.
A fire severely damaged the building in 1939, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they ordered a bell tower.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell "Bells of the Poor".
The professional who played the bell in July called it differently: 'Cultural treasure' and 'Irreplaceable historical instrument'.
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first bell to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell in a Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says no one replaced him at St. Martin's.
In the past few months, St. Martin's has been the home of a complex story of architects and builders, some of whom have been called by lay church officials and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The Council of Elders, the parish' governing body, composed of lay representatives, sent a letter to the diocese in July expressing concerns that the diocese would seek to pass the costs on to the Council of Elders, although the hiring of architects and builders sent by the diocese did not participate in any way.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark wounded a 13-year-old boy in California who was drowning for lobster
According to official reports, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy crying for help, and then he and his whole group paddled to him to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he thought the call was the joy of catching lobster, but then he realized he was screaming, "Bust me!"
He bit me!
When Hammel reached the boy, he noticed that he had torn the entire area of the spine.
I shouted, "Let everyone out of the water! There's a shark in the water!" adds Hammel.
The boy was transported in critical condition by helicopter to San Diego's Council Children's Hospital.
It's not clear what kind of shark was behind the attack.
Captain Larry Giles, a swimmer, told a news conference that the shark had been spotted in the area for weeks, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered a traumatic injury to the upper torso.
For investigative and security reasons, authorities have shut down access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is looking to build a chain of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams-style beauty parlors with specialized retailers.
As part of the UK's strong cosmetics market, which is worth £2.8 billion and is growing further as sales of fashion and household goods are falling, cosmetics streets will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and if successful, will be expanded to other stores next year.
Cosmetic investments are linked to supermarket efforts to find use for shelves that were previously used for television, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury's says it will double its cosmetics offering to 3,000 products and will introduce brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
More space will also be available to existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands, thanks to branded locations similar to those in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-introducing its boutique make-up line, so most products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the first perfume store opened last week in Croydon, south London, and next year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping online and moving toward daily shopping for small amounts of food in local stores means that supermarkets have to do more to attract people.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe says stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain strives to better offer services and non-food products to fight discount vendors like Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos branches and has also launched a number of Habitat branches, which are chains it bought two years ago, which have increased food sales and made the acquisition even more profitable.
A previous attempt at a supermarket to rework its cosmetics and pharmacy department has ended in disgrace.
At the turn of the millennium, Sainsbury's was testing a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after a dispute over the distribution of the proceeds from the sale of drugs in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury's sold its 281 pharmacies for £125 million to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds pharmacy chain, three years ago.
Lloyds is to play its part in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands to its four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Says Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's business manager: "We've changed the look and style of the cosmetic alleys to improve the environment for our customers.
We've also invested in specially trained colleagues that customers can consult with.
Our range of brands should meet all needs and the attractive environment and convenient location mean we now present an attractive place to buy cosmetics that change the old ways of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby pulled out of the £11m deal.
Dragons star Peter Jones is on the rise after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an $11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their Truly brand of home-made clothes and accessories.
The couple's business has been likened to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of the show announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons star Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was furious when the TV star, at a tense Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to new contracts worth up to £1.5 million, he could no longer devote enough time to their Truly brand of home-made clothing and accessories.
The business was likened to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow and could have doubled the fortune of presenter Willoughby's estimated value of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain for one of her summer residences.
An unnamed source said, "The Truly flag was a top priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, which would secure her for decades to come.
Her decision to leave was a complete shock to everyone involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
There's a warehouse full of merchandise ready to sell at Marlow headquarters.
Experts believe the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions given the massive investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewares and the possible further delay in launching the brand.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three, Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Tara Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined the board in March.
Couples are on vacation together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become M&S's brand ambassador and replace Anta McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We're not going to comment on his business".
Difficult negotiations and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he'd get from journalists for a comment that some consider an unfit president and for his positive comments about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded with his ridiculous "voice".
I didn't give up on anything.
He noted that after their first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step towards denuclearizing North Korea, Kim is interested in another meeting.
But the negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "responsive response" from the US to its first steps to disarmament.
Instead, the US continues to impose sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
That would cost millions of lives.
We have a great relationship now.
His efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results, he said.  ending missile tests, helping to free hostages and returning the remains of American troops to their homeland.
And he defended his unusual approach to informing about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, a national disaster was not declared, a prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not seek international assistance, so it is a bit difficult", says Ms Sumbung.
Save the Children is putting together a team that is travelling to Palma, but it is not clear if foreign staff can work there.
The National Disaster Agency spokesman, Mr Sutupo, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Paulo to see if international organizations would be allowed to help.
Because earthquakes occur very frequently in Indonesia, the country is still unfortunately unprepared for Mother Nature's wrath.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, other parts of the coastline are not at all.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Paulo, even though the warning had been issued, likely contributed to the loss of life.
Even at the best of times, traveling between many of Indonesia's islands is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to help earthquake victims is now moving to Paulo, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
Improving Indonesia's poor infrastructure was a major focus of President Joko Widodo's election campaign and the president spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
He's running for re-election next year, but his government is plagued by funding cuts.
President Joko is also facing pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members are embracing a more conservative form of faith.
Street fighting between Christians and Muslims, in which gangs use machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons, have already claimed the lives of more than a thousand people and displaced tens of thousands from their homes.
Look, Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool has scored a goal against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge on Saturday to save Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea.
Sturridge was handed a pass by Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 yards from Chelsea's gate when his team lost 1-0.
He threw the ball to his left and shot at the remote pole.
The bullet was flying high and was heading for the upper right corner of the gate.
The ball eventually leaped over the jumping Cape Arrizabalag and ended up in the net.
"I was just trying to get in the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming towards me, so I didn't think much of it and I just shot him in the face.
Chelsea led 1-0 in the half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker sent his passport back to Mate Kovacic, then turned around in the middle of the field and sprinted halfway to Liverpool.
The quarterback's fastball.
Then he sent the ball down a beautiful alley to Hazard in limestone.
He ran off the defense and ended up with a left-handed stick next to Alison Becker of Liverpool.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool will face the local team in the Champions League group stage at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play at 3pm on Thursday in London with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832
As the Indonesian Disaster Management Office reported on Sunday morning, the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami surged to 832.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck on Friday, triggering waves up to 6 meters high and trapping many people in the rubble of the destroyed buildings, the official said at a press conference.
The city of Paulo, with a population of over 380,000, was besieged by the ruins of ruined buildings.
Police arrested a 23-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
A woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning, and police immediately began investigating the murder.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people in the area who have seen or heard anything to register.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says, "The investigation is still in its infancy, but I would like to appeal to anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers whose on-board cameras may have recorded something, to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation,
A police spokesman confirmed that the dead woman lived in Birkenhead and that the body was found in a building.
Friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene this afternoon to ask where she was found this morning.
Police said they're investigating and are now informing the victims' relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews was just trying to get back to his apartment, but the police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what happened, he couldn't speak.
Residents have now learned that it will take several hours for them to return home.
A policeman told one man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene crying.
He keeps saying it's terrible.
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were on the tape and another was waiting outside.
There are a number of police officers in the enclosed area monitoring the house.
Anyone with any information can message @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and enter code 247 from September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament has recently become a hit due to the debate over the "rewrite of history"
His expulsion would be a deserved punishment for his fanatical Taliban-style Puritan followers destroying many of England's cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "a foolishness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, says: "In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was essential that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster should become one of the targets.
Cromwell did not order or perform iconicism in the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent portrayal of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of 19th-century thought and a part of the historiography of the character that many still think deserves to be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people consider Cromwell, although today a little less than at the end of the 19th century, to be a defender of parliament from outside pressure, in his case of course from the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of intense historical debate.
It is certain that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identified figure who represents one side of this transformation.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance.
A killer pig tore up a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in a market in southeastern China.
As reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday, a man named only Yuan was found dead with a severed artery in a blood clot near a flea market in Liu-Pchan-shuei, Kuech-Chou province.
A pig farmer is preparing to administer the vaccine to pigs in a pigsty on 30 May 2005 in Si-ning City, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly came with a cousin from the adjacent province of Jün-nan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door to the next door unlocked.
He said there was a big pig with blood in the hatch.
According to the information, a forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-pound pig tore the farmer apart.
"My cousin's legs were all bloody and torn", the Guiyang Evening News quoted his cousin as saying, "who he calls Wu".
The security camera footage shows Yuan coming to the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousins.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to keep anyone from thinking of him when police gathered evidence at the scene.
Market officials are reportedly negotiating with Yuan's family for compensation for his death.
While swine attacks on humans are rare, they have occurred in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts and critically injured a man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig dragged a Welsh farmer to a tractor and was driven away by the farmer's wife.
After an Oregon farmer ate his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but blood taste can act as a "triggers".
They're just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect, he said.
The remnants of the Rose hurricane will bring heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to weaken and move over colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the coming days, flooding will bring rain to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 5 a.m. eastern time, Rosa reached a Category 1 hurricane wind speed of 137 km/h (620 miles) southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure edge forms over the Pacific Ocean and moves eastward to the west coast of the United States.
In some parts of Mexico, Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rainfall on Monday.
Tropical humidity, with a near-close edge of low pressure, will cause heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rainfall of 25 to 100 mm locally will cause dangerous tidal flooding, tidal currents and possible landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical moisture will cause rainfall to approach 50 to 75 mm per hour, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Some places in the southwestern United States, especially over much of Arizona, are expected to experience 50 to 100 mm of rainfall.
In rapidly deteriorating conditions, due to the scattered nature of tropical rain, tidal flooding may occur.
Given the danger of tropical rainfall, it would be very unwise to walk into the desert.
Heavy rain can make the canyons angry rivers, and storms can bring local gusty winds and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure edge will bring heavy local rainfall to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total rainfall above 13 mm may occur, which could cause smaller debris streams and slippery roads.
It will be the first rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evening and Monday morning, the Arizona is expected to be hit by a rare tropical storm, and on Monday evening, rain will spread to the area on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners and last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense temperature changes across the United States, because the Arctic will start to cool, but it will still be quite warm in the tropics.
This sometimes leads to extreme temperature changes over short distances.
A great example of a significant temperature difference is the US average on Sunday.
The difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, they'll try again to spread the summer heat.
Most areas in the central and eastern United States are expected to experience a warm early October with temperatures of around 27 °C from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
In New York City, it could be 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about six degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows a high likelihood of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
The Bret Kavanaugh poll has been watched by over 20 million people.
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's captivating statements on six television channels by Supreme Court Justice candidate Bret Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the women who accused him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political turmoil continued, and voters interrupted regular programming with reports of a sudden Friday turnaround: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Christine Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee she's 100 percent sure Kavanaugh touched her at a high school drunken party and tried to undress her.
Kavanaugh in his excited statement said he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
It's likely that more than 20.4 million people watched the event, according to Nielsen.
The company has calculated average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures for the other stations that broadcast the statements, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look in offices.
By comparison, that's the same number of viewers watching a football game in the playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest viewership of any channel, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearing, according to Nielsen.
The second was ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reports that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest continued after the meeting.
The main character of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the office of this moderate Republican made a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him screaming at protesters on Friday morning as he was about to ride an elevator to a courtroom hearing.
CNN broadcast live how for several minutes he stood up with his eyes closed and let himself be cursed.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He also heard, "You have power, but many women are weak".
Flake said his office issued a statement, and before the elevator door was closed, he added that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and television networks later broadcast live as the Judiciary Committee voted to submit Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the charges against the candidate were investigated by the FBI by next week, as demanded by a Democratic minority.
Flakea was partially persuaded by interviews with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was important because it was clear that without an investigation, Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has accused critics of politicizing Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "policy-making about Britain's future and undermining national interests".
British Prime Minister Theresa May is arriving at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, 29 September 2018.
In another interview, which was close to the prime minister on the cover, her former foreign secretary Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan, saying that the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect their tariffs on each other is "absolutely pointless".
Shot on Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dython Simpson, who is suspected of killing an LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU player.
Baton Rouge Police Department said Dyteon Simson, 20, was arrested and detained on charges of second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and police say Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
According to CBS affiliate WABF, police seized the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
According to police, after being questioned, Simpson confessed to shooting Wayde.
According to the lawyer, bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was gunshot wounds to the head and neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Refugee Police Department, the State Police Criminal Investigation Laboratory, Southern University Police Department and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their efforts and their efforts to bring justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-2 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU,
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that Wayde's death shocked the team and shocked him.
"This is what you're still afraid of", Wade said.
The volcano is burning ash on Mexico City
Ash from the Popacatépetl volcano has hit the southern part of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday not to approach the volcano after the volcano's activity increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was tracking a series of rocks and tremors.
Social media has seen images of car windshields covered in a thin layer of ash in some parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in activity in the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of the capital, the last earthquake to hit central Mexico in September 2017 and had a magnitude of 7.1 magnitude.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the independence vote, police clashed with Catalan separatists.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with law enforcement and thousands joined competitive demonstrations on the first anniversary of the independence vote that divided Catalonia.
The police have blocked a group of masked separatists who have thrown eggs and powdered paint on them, creating a dark cloud of dust on the streets that are usually flooded with tourists.
Later, clashes broke out, which police had to use ammunition to calm down.
The pro-independence groups sang for hours, 'We will not forget, we will not forgive' in the face of the Union's protesting supporters who called for 'Long live Spain'.
According to the local press, 14 people were slightly injured in the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but is celebrated by separatist Catalans, tensions remain high in the region seeking independence.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but voter turnout was low because opponents of secession boycotted them.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations in violent clashes across the region.
Independence groups stayed out late Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The demonstration was held, but she had to choose a different route.
Narcis Termes, an electrician in his 60s who joined his wife in a separatist protest, said he no longer hopes for independence for Catalonia.
We had some of the best moments of the past year.
My parents were crying for the joy of being able to vote, but now we're in a dead end, he said.
Despite an important, though close victory in regional elections last December, Catalan independence-backed parties have had to fight to keep things going this year, and many of their most prominent leaders have either gone into exile themselves or are awaiting trial for their part in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old editor Joan Puig recorded a protest in support of the police on her phone, saying the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more tense", he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"Candidating for the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and repression we are witnessing from the Spanish government", he said.
Londoners: Men trapped in a car crash into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings has reported damage to the gate and the house itself.
At some point, someone may have shot the car from the trunk.
Meng's hit secured Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Mengy 's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
Livingston, who had moved up from the lower division, shocked the Rangers, giving Steven Gerrard only the second of 18 defeats as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Mengy's hit proved decisive as Gary Holt's team reached second place at Hibernian.
Gerrard's team has yet to win the Premier League on the home court this season and next Sunday will be the first Hearts team to lose eight points.
Earlier, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna of the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston has extended the division's unbeaten streak to six games, so head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, hasn't lost yet.
Livingston didn 't take a chance against the uncredited guests .
Holt's team should have led long before the goal, because his straightforwardness caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but failed to get past the gate, then Alan Lithgow slipped and just missed Craig Halkett's head at the gate.
The home crowd just watched the Rangers play in front of them, because they knew guests could be plagued by standard situations.
And so came the key goal.
A free kick was set against the Rangers and Livingston created a sling, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson sent Mengu, who ran and scored the ball in the middle of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the ball, but home defense was impenetrable for them, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was usually not too busy.
The same picture was seen in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed another standard Livingston situation.
Livingston's penalty area was constantly flown by centers that players were continually cleaning up, and two penalty kicks came to nothing after Halkett's attack on replacement Glenn Middleton and another one on his hand.
Fenomenon from Livingston  analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They have been exceptionally excellent and continue to exceed expectations on their way up.
Their playing style and team have hardly changed since their return to the top, but Holt deserves great praise for how the team has been doing since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was a great man, leading a highly ordered defense, while Meng kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on call the whole time.
Rangers are lacking in inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they're not up to those standards anymore.
Their end was weak, they only made it home once, and it should be a wake-up call for the Rangers, because they're in the middle of the board.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday, September 29, the sky was blue and everyone was smiling.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to try to straighten relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on a number of issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police for security reasons prevented a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters appeared in the area who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people were heard, many of them Kurds, protesting against Erdogan, condemning his policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The anti-Christian protests reflect the controversy of the visitor, who some German Turks have hailed as a hero and others have accursed as an autocrat.
Deptford accident: Cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m. local time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver stopped the car and an ambulance arrived shortly after, but the man was pronounced dead at the scene.
The death came just months after another cyclist died about a mile from the scene of Saturday's Childers Street accident, when the driver ran off the scene.
Metropolitan Police said officers are now trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The road is closed, buses are running on alternate routes, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in riots
According to the Bureau of Prisons, six guards were injured in riots at a high-security men's prison.
Riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 9:30 local time and continue.
To handle the riots involving eight inmates on one wing, specialized guards from the Tornado Team were called in.
The guards suffered minor injuries and were treated at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: "To handle the ongoing incident at Long Lartin prison, specially trained prison staff were deployed.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be turned over to the police and may spend longer in the jails.
Long Lartin Prison has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had died after an attack on a prisoner in the hospital.
And last October, law enforcement was called to the prison because of a major riot in which staff were attacked with ballistic missiles.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (drought-prone areas may benefit)
It's not unusual for a tropical low-pressure edge to hit Arizona, but that's probably exactly what's going to happen early next week when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa crosses the desert southwest and brings the risk of tidal flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona for southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain on Monday night.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm status or pressure levels below 320 km (320 miles) from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of precipitation, up to 150 mm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, the falls are likely to be 25 to 50 mm, with local increments as high as 100 mm.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing, as the area has been hit by drought.
Flooding is a very serious thing, but these rains may help somewhere, because the southwest of the United States has just hit a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least "extreme drought", the second highest category, according to the weather.com server.
The path of Hurricane Rosa will lead first to the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still a strong hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 137 km/h, will then move 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, on Sunday morning, moving 19 km/h north.
Then the storm meets the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, and thus loses its strength.
It's expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, heavy rainfall is expected, posing a high risk of flooding.
In the area from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, total rainfall is expected to be between 75 and 150 mm, with up to 250 mm, reports weather.com.
Rosa then travels as a tropical storm through Mexico northward, arriving at the Arizona border early Tuesday morning, then crossing Arizona and entering southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The main risk to Rosa or its remnants is expected to be very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States", reports the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause deadly tidal floods and debris flows in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A wounded boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 p.m. local time.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is now stable.
As reported by Avon and Somerset Police, young men aged 17 to 20 were arrested at night in the Radstock area.
Police are looking for witnesses who may have a recording of what happened on their cell phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh has tasted the wickedness and anger of the Democratic Party.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump has stated that Kavanaugh has tasted the wickedness and anger of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that she was sexually assaulted several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford testified at the hearing on her charges.
The president said on Saturday that the Americans witnessed Kavanaugh's greatness and quality and courage.
A representative of his supporters from West Virginia said the affirmative vote of Judge Kavanaugh is a testament to one of the greatest legal minds of our time, a lawyer who has an outstanding public service record.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republicans running in the midterm elections.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm still moving, he said.
That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere.
Trump has declared that the Democrats have opted for opposition and obstruction.
A Republican leadership adviser told CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on Senate floor is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of people have died in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and the casualties continue to rise
Authorities said on Saturday that after a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people lost their lives, many of them trashed by huge waves that flooded the beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered on a beach in the city of Palos for a festival on Friday, but at dusk, waves of up to six meters [6.5 feet] hit the shore, killing many people and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami wave preceded the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately escape, so they were caught by the waves", said BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami wave did not go alone, it took cars, supplies, houses, it hit everything on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coast, the tsunami wave on the open sea was spreading at 800 km/h.
He said that some people escaped to the trees before the wave and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Pal.
Aerial photographs released by the Disaster Relief Agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The effects shook the coastal town on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Application and Assessment (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's powerful earthquakes was about 200 times greater than the force of the World War II atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, which could have increased the tsunami wave.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of the destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater on the coast 300 km north of Palau, in an area called Donggala, which is near the epicenter of the earthquake.
He said communications were "completely disabled" with no information from Donggala.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area and added that its workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get much worse", the statement said.
The agency received considerable criticism on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had struck Paul, although authorities said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur footage shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building screaming desperately to warn people on the street of an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall that carries buildings and vehicles will hit the shore.
Reuters was unable to verify the record immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palo, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials say the army has begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people are still desperately in need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport in the city has been reopened for aid only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Pala on Saturday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Donggala arrived in Paul, where employees were hiding in the shelters of the cells in the courtyard of an office building, they saw images of destruction along the way, says Mr. Doseba.
They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses, he adds.
It's too bad.
When relief groups began their sad disaster relief efforts, some complained that experienced foreign workers were not allowed to come to Paul.
According to Indonesian legislation, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to flow to the disaster site once a national disaster zone has been declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster", says Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "OK, this is a national disaster", we can start international aid, but that's not the case yet.
When the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in Paulo occurred, friends and relatives of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that lighten the murky stories of natural disasters.
A little boy was pulled out of the sewer Saturday.
On Sunday, paramedics released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, was coaching two of the missing paragliders at the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the Ro Ro Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a person who has been paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden", she says.
Mr. Gendon described how in the hours that followed after the paragliding community learned of the Roa Roa Hotel's collapse, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors from Palos who were attending the beach festival.
But instead of a pair of blue strangles, his messages ended up with a gray mark.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered", he says.
Thieves took $26,750 during an ATM refill in Newport on the Levee.
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee on Friday morning while they were filling up an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the driver of the car was emptying the ATM in the entertainment complex and preparing to put more money into it.
While he was doing this, another man ran behind a Brink employee and stole a bag of money to be put in an ATM.
Witnesses reported seeing several suspects flee the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved.
If you have any information about the identity of the suspects, please contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: "Being formally known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the pseudonym as the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is set to introduce his new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande, who has cancelled her appearance for emotional reasons, according to the show's creator.
West has said before that the word has a religious meaning to him, besides shortening his current professional name.
In my opinion, the most commonly used word in the Bible, meaning "this", was West, who was heard speaking about his album earlier this year with radio host Big Boy.
So it's you, it's us, it's us.
It's changed from Kanye, which means the one, to just Ye  as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our mess, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are,
A number of other famous rappers have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known at various times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced he preferred the names Love (love) and Brother Love (brotherly love).
West's former JAY-Z associate also alternated his name with and without a link, in capital and small letters.
Mexican President AMLO has promised not to use the military against civilians
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the bloody attack on students, newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza promised he would never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
At a time when the left-wing student movement was spreading throughout Latin America, soldiers began shooting people at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly tuition to those who are studying and opening up more free public universities.
He claimed that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are drawing young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for AI.
According to investor and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the US should double the amount it spends on research in this area.
The comments come after various parts of the US government issued announcements about AI, even though the US as a whole has no formal strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China launched a plan last year to be the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are way beyond the U.S. and we're looking for another breakthrough in AI", Lee says.
Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week that doubling funding could double the chance that the next big AI breakthrough will be made in the US.
Lee, who published his book Superpower AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that surpassed the best American player in the game Othello, and later served as Microsoft's chief research officer and president of Google's Chinese subsidiary.
Lee praised the U.S. government's previous technology competition, like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be to help identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
"Academic excellence is not led by China, but by corporations", Lee says.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring the best university professionals in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes to immigration policy could also help the United States improve AI efforts.
"I think AI PhD holders should be automatically offered green cards", he says.
The State Council of China issued a new generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way that the National Science Council and other government organizations give money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee says.
The U.S. Department of Defense has established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence this year to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of an AI Selection Committee.
And DARPA this month announced it was investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it now invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
But the U.S. legislature, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory, and therefore has vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents have argued that the change would weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slav population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for a boycott has cast doubt on whether the required minimum 50 percent of voters will be available to make the referendum valid.
The question in the referendum was: 'Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price to pay for Macedonia, one of the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia, to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia to live freely under the roof of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", says 79-year-old Oliver Georgijevska of Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough MPs have said they will follow the vote.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no problems were reported by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters finally cast their vote.
'I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,' says Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital of Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in the Macedonian referendum on a name change that would open the country's way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumić, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is setting up a small stage in front of the Parliament in Skopje and pulling out chairs in front of tents built by people boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads up, not the door to the service", says Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they don't want us to be like Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%, much needed investment.
"I think a large majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
The result would be a confirmation of our future.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters could attend the referendum , which is less than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian television station Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% said they'd vote yes.
To make the referendum a success, it must be 50 percent plus one voter.
The failure of the referendum would mark the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took office last May.
Look, Sergio Aguero of Manchester City has come through the whole of Brighton's defence for a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday led the defence of Brighton, securing a 2-0 win for Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In Aguero's delivery, his goal in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy.
It all started with the Argentine striker getting a play in the middle of the field.
He sprinted between three Brighton defenders and got into the open.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green shirts.
On the edge of the penalty area of Brighton, he passed one defender and outran several others.
The next left-hander found Sterling.
The English striker tied the ball in penalty area back to Aguilar, who overtook Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-handed shot.
"Aguero has foot problems", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We thought he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's the way it was.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment.
The initial lead for the Sky Blues in this Premier League match was secured by Sterling.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area.
On the left, he sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane worked the ball up and then sent Sterling to the remote bar.
The Sky Blues striker threw the ball into the net just before slipping off the field.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany, on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m.
Scherzer wants to ruin the joy of the Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from playoff contention, there wasn't much reason to re-enter the game.
But Scherzer, a perennial contender, hopes to take the pitcher's spot in the Colorado Rockies game on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, who lead the NL West by one game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, have the chance to make the playoffs.
The Rockies have at least a wild card win 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still looking to win their first division title.
Even if we're not playing for anything, we can at least get started, because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing, and the second team will play with the best effort I'll ever have this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play it?
The Nationals haven't announced who's starting on Sunday yet, but they're reportedly inclined to throw Scherzer for a situation like this.
He'd be a 34th-place starter for Scherzer, training Thursday and throwing Sunday, when he's usually off.
The right-handed pitcher from Washington is 18-7 this season with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump is at a meeting in West Virginia
The president was indirectly speaking about the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee, Bret Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of Republicans running in the midterm elections.
"In November, everything we've accomplished will be at stake.
We've got five weeks to make one of the most important choices of our lives.
He's one of the big, big, big, I'm not running, but we're still moving, and I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere, he said.
Trump went on: "You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see it's happening right now.
And they're determined to take power by whatever means necessary, you see the wickedness, the disgust.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to overthrow to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give it to them.
He says the Democrats have opted for opposition and obstruction.
And you see that in the last four days, he added, and he said that Democrats are angry and evil and disgusting and lying.
He mentioned the Senate Judiciary Committee's oldest member, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to a loud crowd buzz.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait, that was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a mixed opinion.
He's intolerant of those who express their opinions
When activists from Momenta in my local party voted for my admonition, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome  because they have been honest about their views.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she was a strong anti-Semite.
In my case, I was criticized in the memo for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, paradoxically similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
The Labour Party's announcement on Friday's meeting in Nottingham East said that we wanted the meetings to be accessible and productive.
For most of the eight years I was a local Labour MP, the GC meetings on Friday night were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, most meetings do not take place today, and the promise of a more kind, more polite policy has long been forgotten, if ever it was.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is assessed as acceptable to the leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues I had previously thought had similar political views on suddenly expected me to turn 180 degrees and take positions I would otherwise not agree with  whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public  and no matter what I say  then there's a barrage of insults on social media where they call for my appeal, condemn the politics of the centre and tell me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because comments directed at me are usually political.
I respect the professionalism and determination of those of my colleagues who face a surge of sexist or racist insults every day, but never give up.
One of the aspects of this political era that I'm most disappointed in is how insults become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the mixed opinion stream and with every motion of no confidence or change in the selection rules, the party becomes more limited.
In the last two years, I've been advised many times to stay back, not to speak so much, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a schoolboy 32 years ago, provoked by the negligence of Margaret Thatcher's government, which literally broke up my general school class, I have been fighting for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been surprised by my political positions and areas where I disagreed with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would just say that when the country breaks into Brexit, which will damage our homes, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But my main message is not to the Nottingham Moment, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of impeachment or political pragmatism will deter me from acting in what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38  17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
Two late fifths slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in this amazingly entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
Now they're at the top of the table, like the only undefeated.
In the end, it was an excellent defense and better use of the odds that helped the home team win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've been through a lot of trials in our matches and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he says.
Robyn Christie from Melrose says, "To Ayra's credit, they took a chance better than us".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute five, converted by Frazier Clim, sent Ayr forward, but a yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to use the numerical advantage and Jason Baggot to win an unchanged five.
Climo increased Ayra's lead by a penalty and then scored exactly halfway through and turned the solo effort up to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's five, altered by Baggot, cut the lead to five points.
Then there was a longer delay due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, who left the pitch on the cartridge, and when the game started again, Ayr jumped again thanks to Stafford McDowall's five, which he turned into Climo.
Rep. Ayra Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose was able to use the extra players again thanks to Bruce Colvin's unchanged five after a short, strong push.
The home crowd returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow for attacking Clim without a ball, MacPherson of the penalty box put the ball behind the advancing mound of Ayra.
The climate changed, again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth home run.

The sea is ours: Inland Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors are guarding the naval headquarters in La Paz, which is decorated with rope.
There's a blue flag in the color of the ocean above public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are described by the slogan: "The sea is our right.
It is our duty to obtain it.
Across the interior of Bolivia, there are still vivid memories of the coastline the country lost to Chile in the 19th century's bloody resource war  as well as the desire to regain the Pacific Ocean.
These wishes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia awaits an international court ruling, which is due to expire on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, expects a positive outcome", says Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the MSD decision on large screens across the country in the hope that the Hague tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia's claim that  after decades of disrupted talks  Chile is bound to negotiate to grant Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president Evo Morales, who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year, is also keenly interested in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he declared in late August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia  and even if it did, much would remain the same.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to assign Chilean territory to anyone and said it would not determine the outcome of any possible talks.
The fact that the MSD's decision comes only six months after the last arguments were made shows that the case was not complicated, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years, not only have they not supported the cause of Bolivia, but maybe they've been holding it back.
"The current Bolivian government has taken over the issue of access to the sea", says Zarate.
He adds that Morales' aggressive rhetoric has weakened all remaining goodwill in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will once again start negotiations, but after that it will be extremely difficult to have a discussion.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia a unique opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of disagreements over mutual benefits, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, one of Latin America's most beloved presidents, would still use the sea as a political tool.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to deal with the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless the US can trust it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to disarm its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at the summit of the leaders of the two rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy, which has been stuck at a dead end for more than three months for a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says he's "planing to hope that the ongoing U.S. sanctions and objections to the declaration ending the Korean War could someday bring the North to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration unless Pyongyang takes significant disarmament steps first.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is seriously considering abandoning this arsenal, which the country likely sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo wants to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris shows show that the latest trend of giant headgear is coming to your fashion stores soon
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block out the sun, your search is over.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of large, trimmed headgear for their spring/summer 2019 collection at a show that caught everyone's eye at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, very impractical hats flooded Instagram, and these designers sent their exciting creations to the fair.
A display piece from Valentine's Day was an oversized beige hat with a wide edge reminiscent of a feather that flooded the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included ornate melons, a witch hat, and even pineapples but not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks  and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have sewn lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One design resembled scuba gear with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a corn with melted ice cream.
And if you keep up with the huge fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that giant hats could even make it to fashion stores.
The overgrown hats come from La Bomba, a straw with a half-metre wide straw that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski wore.
The cult brand behind this very impractical hat, which has flooded social media, has sent another huge creation to the show mound -- a beach bag made of straw that is almost as big as the model in the swimsuit that wears it.
A dark orange raffle bag with raffle shrouds and white leather sleeves was the exhibition piece of the 2019 La Riviera Spring/Summer collection by Jacques Jacques at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to be in fashion stores for next summer. Given the designer's success with them, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are a must for global citizens
The Scottish Independent Schools have achieved a number of academic achievements and continue to do so in 2018 with further outstanding test results.
These schools have over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, are represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and strive to provide the best possible level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools prepare their students for further and higher education, the careers they choose, and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement tailored school curricula, we see that modern languages are still popular and sought after subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to a person in a language they understand, it goes straight into their head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes right into his heart.
It's a significant observation that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we can't rely on English alone.
The latest results of this year's exams show that languages are at the top of the charts, with independent schools having the highest success rates.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned a foreign language achieved their best A's.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that the highest A score was achieved by 72 percent of Mandarin students, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as subjects of choice are as important in the curricula of independent and other schools as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A survey carried out by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of people with language skills deficiencies, for reasons employer cited as problems filling vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more jobs require languages, these skills are a necessity in a globalized world.
Whatever career you choose, if you learn a second language, you will have the real advantage of having such a lifelong skill in the future.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage over the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov in 2013 of 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of them were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, with the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, namely 15 percent, being French.
That's why it's important for children today to invest in language learning.
If children learn more languages, especially languages from developing economies, they will have a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages taught.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered most important to the UK in the 2020 outlook, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child is interested in, they will always have independent schools to choose from, with teachers who are experts in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing an educational environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
At this point, there is no denying that languages are essential to the future of the country in the global business environment, and that this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be considered as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's called bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will be performing in his first Lakers outfit in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans looking forward to LeBron James' first appearance for the Los Angeles Lakers will soon be waiting.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will be playing in Sunday's preseason opener in San Diego against the Denver Nuggets.
It's not clear how many minutes he'll be.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play only a limited number of minutes.
Last week after practice, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers preseason games.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career", he said.
Trump's performance in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a wave of campaign appearances tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five meetings scheduled for next week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the suspension of the vote to confirm his top court nominee, Trump wants to gain support for the upcoming midterm election as Republicans face the risk of losing Congress in the November election.
What time does Trump's performance start tonight, and how can you watch him online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 PM Eastern time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting in West Virginia online below via a live YouTube feed.
Trump is likely to speak about the Supreme Court's hearing of Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh, which took place this week and was highly tense over allegations of sexual misconduct.
But the main goal of this wave of meetings is to help the Republicans pick up pace before the November election.
According to Reuters, campaign organizers say President Trump's five meetings next week are intended to "energize volunteers and supporters so that Republicans can try to protect and expand their Senate and House majority".
"Control of the Senate is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible during this busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could attend today's meeting at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and be followed by media outlets in Pittsburgh.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, where he scored more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is running back in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that he has to come to the president to help him with his investigations", says Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown its stomach fighting to keep hope from Sunday singles
After three one-sided games, Saturday's pair could be just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging swing is a completely fictitious sporting concept, but the players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this.
So where's the pendulum going now?
"They've led by six points and now it's four, so we're taking it that the pendulum is probably moving a little towards us", Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, leading by four points and 12 points.
As Spieth says, the Americans feel they have a little bit of wind in their sails, and there are many things that can encourage them, like the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each can boast three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly in the transition from the firehouse to the green, setting an example.
The celebrity screams intensified his ride as he managed to take the key step to win the entire game after two holes behind Thomas.
His putt, who won their 15-hole game, has been met with a similar outcry that tells you the American team isn't out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own game", Spieth said.
That's all any of these players left.
18 holes to leave a trail.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, arguably the main story behind the Ryder Cup.
Strange but lovely couples from Europe are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood was the only couple who didn't hit the pit on Saturday afternoon, but they did on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and again Friday morning".
The course and the way the energy flows toward the stormy crowd confirms that these are the players destined for Sunday's victory, and that by sunset over Le Golf Naitional there will be no player more popular than Fleetwead or Molinari.
Best both at the same time in a different pit.
But the talk of European fame remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly collaborated with Serge Garcia, the morning four-ball hero when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The pit and two of the top nine double-digits have buried Spain and Sweden in a chasm they never climbed again.
But on Sunday, no one will be able to help you.
Two-pairs on two balls is so fascinating when you watch the interaction of people in a couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe had played better as a team so far and had taken a significant lead by the last day, but this two-pair game also showed that the US team had a stomach for the fight that some, especially from the states, doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 points on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will gain a healthy lead until the final day of the Ryder Cup after a 10-6 lead over the United States from Saturday's two-on-two play.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who reportedly won almost twice over struggling Tiger Woods, decided to make four cuts at Le Golf National.
The European side with Thomas Bjørn, who decided two years ago to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltin, dominated the morning game by two balls with the American side failing to make the series 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four, won two games, but couldn't get to the deficit.
Jim Fury's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12 games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four of their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a two-ball game, they still smoothly beat tired Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more strongly 5&4.
Woods, who lasted two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but now he's lost 19 of his 29 games in a two-on-two game and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting after the morning game of two balls, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in a 2&1 double-header defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - singles and triple-heads in the world rankings.
But Europe was not victorious on this pleasant, fresh day southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won the tough 2&1 victory over Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a two-ball game and later came back to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in a two-ball game, though he lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history have the team come back from a four-point deficit to a two-game deficit, although as a defending Furyk side, it only needs a draw to win the trophy.
After the second day was the best in two days, it seems Sunday's counterattack is behind them.
North Korea says it will not under any circumstances disarm unilaterally and without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that continued UN sanctions have deepened their distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country will never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told his annual general meeting that North Korea had taken last year "significant goodwill measures" such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing sites and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see an appropriate response from the US", he said.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, unilateral disarmament is not possible.
While Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "gradual" approach to denuclearization that would reward North Korea for every step it takes, his statement was significant in that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization simply because Pyongyang has already done so in the past.
Ri mentioned a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula while Trump promised security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 war, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted calls for the release of tough international sanctions against North Korea.
The US is insisting on denuclearization first and increasing pressure on sanctions to enforce its targets, even protesting against declaring an end to the war, Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of people who know nothing about us.
The problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our distrust.
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: If the denuclearization side of this issue were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a stalemate.
However, Ri's tone was dramatically different from last year's speech when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's missile targeting on US soil was inevitable after the "bad president" Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened the "total destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work still had to be done and sanctions had to remain in place until North Korea was completely denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for it, saying, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia have argued that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue swiftly and unceasingly until we realize complete, final, verified denuclearization".
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN General Assembly by the side, and Pompeo announced that he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't end well.
He left Pyongyang in July and declared that progress had been made, only for North Korea to declare within hours that he had raised gangster demands.
North Korea has pledged to meet with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and nuclear complex if the United States takes appropriate action.
He said Kim had informed him that the appropriate measures he hoped for were security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and were aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course that's supposed to teach them enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has made all its students sleep more, in an effort to combat the growing culture of all-night macho study, where students don't sleep and cheer up on caffeine.
Academics have found that students at the world's most renowned universities are often helpless when it comes to the basics of self-care.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why are you telling me this just now, in my senior year?'
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, provides students with basic information on how good sleep habits help them perform academically and athletically and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's chief medical officer, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were not really sleepy during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One is a picture of student colleges where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers, and books about the effects of caffeine and light, and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleep habits.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
We know that students' behavior doesn't change immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes", added Professor Czeisler.
A culture of pride in 'studying all night' still exists, he added, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is also growing.
Getting enough good quality sleep should be the student's secret weapon for fighting stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to prevent weight gain, because sleep deprivation turns the brain into starvation mode, so you're still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design a course that one of his classmates took last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push through the course.
He hopes to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program before entering a competitive institution.
The professor advised students to consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can determine your circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: The Meng goal has drowned Gerrard 's men
The Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Mengy's hit confirmed Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox struggled to record their first victory from 4 to 1 February in a triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his post eight points ahead of Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes into the half and the Rangers seemed to lack the inspiration and determination to settle.
While the Rangers are now relegated to sixth place, Livingston is climbing to third and right behind the Hibernian team by one goal.
And there could be more trouble for the Rangers after linebacker Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after he was apparently hit by a target from the theater.
Gerrard made eight changes to his side, which overtook Ayr to reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who last week picked up a Hearts point and would be happy as his well-trained team strangled their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have controlled the hold, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were scheduled to score just two minutes into the game when Meng first let Scott Pittman in on Allan McGregor, but the quarterback buried his big shot.
Keagan Jacobs' long-range free kick then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only try out the back position.
The Rangers took control, but it seemed like there was more hope than faith in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have a quarter-hour penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson threw the Colombian challenge off the table.
The Rangers managed only two shots to the goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was surprised by Lassana Coulibaly's headline and Ovie Ejaria's short shot.
While Livi's 34-minute opening may have been against the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the hard work.
The Rangers have again failed to cope with the deep Jacobs set.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and picked up Meng for an easy finish.
Gerrard took action on the break and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange was almost instantaneous when the wing was in Morelos, but the imposing Kelly fought from the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into the game of the exact kind they love when Lithgow and Halkett threw one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have deepened their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to block Jacobs before Litgow ran out of the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton had another late penalty claim when he got into trouble with Jacobs, but Thomson turned away again.
Almanacs: The inventor of the Geiger reader
And now the page from our almanac Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, today is 136 years old, and it's still rising... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger reader.
The constant science of Geiger Counter then became a constant pop culture as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring the seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What the hell is that?
Rogers: It's a Geiger reader that's used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear the effects of the radioactive atoms in minerals.
Evans: Oh, yeah, it's really going to break down now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see dangerous cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and converting them into a laboratory
Then they can see the protein that's common to many cancers, and then they can inject it again.
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches her immune system to recognize dangerous cells lost her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, transforming them in the laboratory so they can see a protein common to many cancers called HER2 and then reapply it back into the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine".
HER2 drives the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach, where immune cells were removed from patients and taught to target cancer cells, has been used in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West attended the pro-Trump sermon in his magic hat after his performance on SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was spanked at Saturday Night Live after a confused performance, during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After he sang the third song that night called Ghost Town, in which he wore the Make America Great Again cap, he began spitting on the Democrats and repeated his support for President Trump.
I often talk to white people and they say, "How can you love Trump, when he's a racist?"
If I were to object to racism, I wouldn't be in America long ago, he said.
SNL has launched a parody show starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Bret Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of the rape of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, footage of West's theatrical speech was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West.
West also complained to the audience that his head ornament was being eaten up in the background.
I was bullied behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go in there with that hat".
He's a bully!
They also said I was in the wrong place, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the wrong place?" and added that he would wear his Superman suit because it means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love.
His comments only earned the audience a buzz at least twice, and the members of SNL looked upset, embarrassed, Variety says, and one person even said, "The whole studio was completely silent".
Westa was invited as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many by singing the song I Love disguised as a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from TPUSA's conservative leader, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous characters:
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply who he was, and that's absolutely amazing.
But I don't want to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I believe is representing and broadcasting an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's single.
Just like us", she added.
Before the performance, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, formerly known as Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to the symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charges of attempted murder in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was killed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is due in Belfast on Monday.
The charges are being reviewed by the state's attorney's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has been released into a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy HBO series Sword in the Hand.
The 31-year-old actor, however, has moved away from the stereotype of a macho hero and said that such roles on screen mean that young boys often feel they have to be tough to earn respect.
He told The Sunday Times Culture Kit that he believed something was wrong and asked how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Throne Star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted to speaking out quite strongly about the issue.
"I personally feel, at this point, quite strongly - what's wrong with masculinity?" he said.
What do we teach teenage men about the problem we see here?'
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity thanks to its highly masculine characters.
He continued: "What is born and what is taught?
What do boys learn on TV, on the streets, that makes them feel like every man needs to have that side of himself?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because young men have certainly changed for the worse.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not be playing in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the series ended because he had had enough of the fights and the horses.
From November, Kit will star in the restored True West of Sam Shepard, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his current wife Rose is the best thing that ever came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the set of the show, so he gave me my future family and my whole life afterwards", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love object of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official figures, more than 820,000 people in the country are infected with the virus.
In the second quarter of 2018, approximately 40 000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, which meant a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV is spread through parts of China through infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people each year.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still reportedly widespread.
Given the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the diseases transmitted are caused by insufficient sexual protection during these contacts.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV treatment as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff would have let GOP senators' data leak, the terms "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory" are being used.
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that a member of her staff had sent personal data of three Republican U.S. senators to lawmakers' web sites.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the allegations were backed by far-right scientists and websites.
"Lies, lies and other despicable lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released allegedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was leaked online Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual abuse by Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that sources the contributions to is linked to Waters' office and have published information about Waters staff members, Hill says.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and a total lie", Waters continued.
A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations - was not in any way responsible for the leak.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.
Waters' statement quickly garnered online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry", Fleischer wrote.
That suggests he's not in the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
He can't be defiant.
He must not question the prosecution's motives.
He must be calm and not agitated.
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized for appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who contested the election against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it were true, it would be something", he tweeted.
In its statement, Waters stated that her office had alerted the relevant authorities and the authorities involved in criminal proceedings to these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", she continued, "and that they are legally responsible for all their acts that are devastating and dangerous to everyone and all members of my staff".
Johnny English again intervenes reviews  weaker spy parody Rowan Atkinson
It's already common to look for Brexit in every new British-themed film, which seems to be the case with this revival of Johnny English in a series of action parodies - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this bold satire about how obviously bad a nation we are be our new export opportunity?
In any case, this disgusting, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to repackage things in a whole new way -- that name more than anything else as a signal that it was a broad comic creation intended for a non-English speaking cinematic audience.
He's, of course, the stupid undercover agent who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean, and a big crush on the guy who sang the one-ton chariot of fire at the London 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony.
The character is also based on the traveler and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the long-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, who left behind chaos.
There's a good moment or two in this latest edition of JE.
I loved Johnny England as he approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blade briefly pinched his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is exposed, but humor feels rather under-sized and oddly unnecessary, especially when serious film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more like it's meant for children than adults, and to me Johnny English's crazy trampolines are as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film gags in Mr. Bean.
The constant assumption is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated a British super-secret spy web and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of an agent on duty - too small a role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the final straw for a prime minister who's a fancy and passionate character who's already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson plays the likes of Theresa May as best she can, but there's not much in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that once every one of her active spies is threatened, she'll have to get someone retired back to work.
That means Johnny English himself, who is now employed as the director of some luxury facility, but also gives a record-breaking lesson on how to be a secret agent: here are some nice gags, because English offers a spy academy similar to the School of Rock.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and met his long-suffering former partner Bough, who was again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man living with a submarine commander, an affected character, who with Vicki Pepperdine's talent may be wasting a little.
So Batman and Robin, packing assignments for Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action and meet the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being dangerously enchanted by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to solve British computer crimes: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey full of jokes: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos as they sneak aboard a luxury Volt yacht; and English unleashes pure anarchy as he attempts to use virtual reality to discover the interior of the Volt house.
All the aces are definitely ready for this final sequence, but as kind and violent as she is, she has something of a children's TV.
It's a rather moderate matter.
And like Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but wonder: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labour denies they would develop a plan for the British to work four days a week to get paid in five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan where the British work four days a week and get paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the company's heads to hand over the savings resulting from the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to the workers.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would still get the same pay.
Sources say this idea would fit the party's economic agenda and it plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.
The shift to a four-day work week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A longtime Labour member told the Sunday Times: 'An assessment of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day work week is a wish that fits into the party's stance to balance the economy in favour of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The work week on Wednesday is not the policy of our party and the party does not take it into account.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to fulfill his vision of a socialist revolution in economics.
Mr. McDonnell has stated his commitment to returning the energy of the anonymous CEOs and alumni of utility companies.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies do not have to return to their overall share because the Labour government could make a 'cut' on the basis of perceived guilt.
It also confirmed plans to place employees on the boards of companies and to set up ownership funds which would transfer 10% of the private enterprise's equity to employees entitled to annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said on the 60-minute show that the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination for at least a week, raising the question of whether the bureau's findings could shake some Republican senators into a campaign to support his nomination.
In a 60-minute interview on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy looked more open than his South Carolina colleague.
I mean, of course, Kennedy said.
I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the charges came out, and I said, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.
But Graham 's decision is unshakable .
"I've already made my decision against Brett Kavanaugh, and that would be a really explosive accusation", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it, "and Graham sent it to him with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people she named could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changing.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the annual Global Citizen Festival music event takes place in New York City, offering a very impressive array of stars and an equally impressive mission to end global poverty.
The seventh annual Global Citizen Festival welcomes tens of thousands of people to Central Park to not only enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of Global Poverty, an international group promoting poverty eradication by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free event ticket (if you weren't willing to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or events, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen 12 years ago before it reached its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really the way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called clicktivism -- people who feel that signing an online petition or tweeting will make a difference?
Global Citizen says it has seen more than 19 million actions by its supporters since 2011, trying to achieve various goals.
He says that these actions have contributed to world leaders announcing commitments and measures worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
The group has also been involved in the development of new business models and new technologies.
The Group estimates that the funds secured have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide to date.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, a UK partnership of investors and developers committed to helping children grow to their full potential, pledging $35 million to help end malnutrition in the region after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can only make a note of the social injustice of malnutrition in history", Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen replied: "It's going to be a long, hard road - sometimes we fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers in New York this year, who will host Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy to blockade Russia's energy exports.
Washington can resort to the Navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy from entering markets including the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinka argued that Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to channel energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe", he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
The United States has the opportunity to use our navy to ensure that sea lanes are open and blocked if necessary to ensure that their energy is not directed to the market he said.
Zinc spoke to participants at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is seen as the voice of energy consumers in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to negotiations with Russia and Iran, and noted that they're practically the same.
The economic option for Iran and Russia is more to invest in or replace fuels,he said, and also referred to Russia as a one-stopper player with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The announcement comes as the Trump administration's mission is to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and replace Russian gas, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the unsuitable Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin the "most important city" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US has taken a position from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The largest German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the US to avoid EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supplies", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to take a closer look at the 2020 presidential campaign, says a senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that after the midterm elections, she's taking a closer look at her presidential candidacy.
During a meeting of the Holyoke, Massachusetts, City Council, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, including a top female position", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I'll be taking a closer look at the presidential candidacy.
Warren also mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting and said he was leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm scared to death of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren was open in her criticism of Trump and his appointment of Chief Justice Bret Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted that, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
But a poll released Thursday showed that most Warren voters don't think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the likely Massachusetts voters said a senator should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the nomination.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent for and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names mentioned in connection with a potential bid for office in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make an official decision in January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD track Palin at a meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being listed in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through after he comes back, could be about other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are coming back with", she told the audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other war veterans that they were coming back a little different, coming back healed, coming back and asking if there was any respect for the things that their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military gave to their country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assaulting a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the call for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to new U.S. government measures that deny asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and a district in Washington issued a brief report on Friday to support asylum seekers and challenge the measure, NBC reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, which was filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner and his sons and gang members abused her, but the U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers for the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing pervasive gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 immigration appeals court ruling that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine of D.C. said in a statement Friday that the new measure "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle, said a short friend.
The lawyers further argued briefly that policies that deny immigrant entry are damaging the U.S. economy and say they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "add the necessary jobs".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,Sessions said in a statement on 11 June.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Pala, where the death toll has doubled, are racing to find survivors over time.
For the survivors, the situation got worse and worse.
"It's very tense", said the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma, who was comforting her feverish boy at an evacuation center in the dry city of Palo.
Every minute, the ambulance will bring in more bodies.
Clean water is a precious resource.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, choosing between crushed objects and trying to save whatever they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake were crippled.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, were resting at the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside for continued severe concussions.
Tears filled his eyes as he described the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking a hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
It was not time to save yourself.
I think I was drawn into the collapse of the wall, Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
I heard my wife calling for help, but then it's quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're okay.
US Ambassador accuses China of bullying with propaganda ads
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American newspaper that focused on the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned the paid subscription to the Des Moines Register of China Daily - Iowa's top-selling newspaper - after he accused China of trying to meddle in the US congressional elections on November 6.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the US election marked what US officials said was a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to exert pressure on China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to advertise in support of trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in an escalating trade war that is manifested at the level of mutual imports.
China's retaliatory sanctions at the beginning of the trade war were designed to target exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a statement in the Des Moines Register Sunday that China is now doubling the scandal by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is leveraging the valuable American tradition of free speech and the free press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"Unlike in a Beijing street newsstand, you'll find limited dissent and you won't see any real reflection of the dissent that the Chinese might have on China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is owned by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that one of China's leading newspapers declined an offer to publish his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans are leaving their constituencies before the election because of a debacle with Kavanaugh, analysts warn.
As many top Republicans are being defended by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault charges, the analyst warned that they will get a response, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this case have been extremely high, and most Republicans on record are already saying they want to continue voting.
These things cannot be turned back", said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona's last-minute effort to investigate the FBI will be enough to calm voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, and they will not forget November", Karine Jean-Pierre, chief counsel and spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted 'November is coming!' at a demonstration in the Senate lobby where Republicans in charge of the Judiciary Committee decided to appoint Kavanaugh despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
'Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break records,' said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst.
People say it was high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among the hesitant female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who don't like the president but don't often go to the polls.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegation of sexual assault on a Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed, resistance could follow.
"This has led to a confusing mess for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh gets on the board, it's about how the Republicans did it and how they handled it", Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps vote Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided on who to trust in light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with somewhat more sympathy for the latter appointed.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or likely believed Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was likely or certainly lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake's FBI, it is currently investigating charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that she was attacked by a drunken Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that a Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals at a party while she was a student at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet and outpace Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the open source platform of Berners-Lee called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of the Inrupt project was global dominance.
"We have to do it now", he said of this startup.
It's a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own personal online data warehouse or POD.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about a personal online data warehouse is that it's entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, the aim of the Inrupt project is to bring resources, processes and relevant skills to help the Solid platform become available to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the employees working on the project, collaborating on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with Facebook and Google are not talking about implementing a complete change where all their business models are upside down overnight.
We're not asking for their permission.
Berners-Lee wrote in his press release published on Saturday that the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate about net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergyman who received the Victoria Cross during World War I
It has been celebrated 100 years since the only clergyman in the Church of England won Victoria's Cross as a warrior during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the Medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, and he never knew he had won Britain's highest military award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone to him at a ceremonial parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his great-grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "geniusly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's triumphal achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Col. Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin with very thick fog and heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.
He later got to the front line and with the greatest courage he led the front line before he jumped into the fire field and knocked out three separate units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather's actions were something I would never do, but also something humiliating.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, they laid the wreath after a performance by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the show, adding that the true hero's courage is shown by the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 instead of getting Peppa Pig
Imagine you waited all night to watch a bloated Bellator 206 just to be denied the main event.
The San Jose count contained 13 points, including six on the main card, and was broadcast live across the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their match, the UK audience was stunned when the news turned into a show about Peppa the Pig.
Some remained restless after waking up early in the morning to a fight.
One fan on Twitter described the change to a children's show as a "just a bad joke".
The government's regulation says that 6am is not appropriate and that children's programmes must be broadcast, said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, after being asked about the broadcast.
♪ Piggy Peppa, yeah. ♪
Bellator President Scott Coker said they would work on the programme to engage UK audiences in the future.
"I think when I think about broadcasting, we can probably handle it", Cooker said.
But it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday, and we can't do it until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were a lot of text messages going back and forth, and not all of them were exactly friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was the government.
I promise you, it won't happen again.
We're cutting it down to five games instead of six, like we usually do, and we tried our best to keep the promise we made to the fans, and we didn't make it.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley felt worthless because of his sexuality
Olympic water skier Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that motivated him to pursue success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize until he was in high school that everyone was like him.
On the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, which was hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out loud about gay rights to give to others.
He also said that the opportunity to become a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
Regular host of the long-running show Kirsty Young was on sick leave for several months.
Daley, who appeared as a tramp on Lavern's first show, said he felt "less valuable" than anyone else who grew up with him because "it was socially unacceptable to like boys and girls".
He said, "Until now, these feelings of inferiority and differentness were the real things that gave me strength and power to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was someone, he said not to let anyone down who might find out what his sexuality was like.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a high-profile LGBT rights activist and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he called because he felt lucky that he could live openly without consequences and wanted to give others more.
The three-time world champion said that his falling in love with the husband of American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, got him unprepared.
Daley married Oscar-winning actor 20 years older last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
When you experience so much at such a young age, at his first Olympics, he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later, and he said it was not easy to find someone of his age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The two adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley's son in June, and Daley said he's changed his whole outlook.
If you asked me last year, it would all be in the style of winning a gold medal, he said.
You know, there's bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie.
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father disagreed with his dying, and the last thing he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the front row.
I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be in the front row, Dad, he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until the moment he stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally realized he wasn't invincible", he said.
A year before that, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew I'd dreamed of this my whole life "jumping in front of my family at the Olympics, I don't know of a better feeling", he said.
It also inspired his first song, "The Stride of Heather Small", which resonated with him at the opening of the Olympics and still evoked a goose's skin.
The Desert Island Discs programme is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was out of shape, ended up on the bench Saturday at the Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson would have hit a record 47 on Sunday, playing the Ryder Cup, but he would have had to adjust his form to prevent an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the event every two years with a record of 12th, sent Captain Jim Furyk on the bench for Saturday's fourball and foursome.
Instead of being at the center of events, as was often the case in the United States, the five-time major champion spent his day alternating between cheering and working on a game in a row that he hoped would fix what was bothering him.
The 48-year-old has never been the most straightforward driver, not even at the peak of his career, so he's not the ideal choice for a narrow Le Golf National, where a long, divided terrain routinely punishes stray shots.
And if the golf course itself isn't worrying enough, Mickelson will face up to the British Open's exact champion Francesc Molinarim in Sunday's ninth match, who won all four of his games this week with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who were four points short, launched 12 separate swords, avoided a quick advance, Mickelson's sword could prove to be absolutely vital.
Furyk expressed his trust in his husband and gave nothing more.
"He understands the role he's playing today, he's been slapping me on the back, he's been holding my hand around my shoulder, and he's been saying he'll be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
She believes so much in herself.
He's a member of the House of Slam and he's been so helpful to these teams in the past and this week.
I guess I couldn't imagine him playing two swords.
I imagined more, but that's how it developed, and we thought we should go this way.
He wants to participate, like everyone else.
Mickelson surpasses Nick Fald's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that never reached the height of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk says his presence with the team has brought some intangible results.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to make fun of people and is a great team roommate", he explained.
I think the younger players enjoyed going to him this week, too, which was fun to watch.
It gives it a lot more than just a game.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that a big lead heading into singles from the last few days of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane made his debut in a game in 1997 at Valderrama, where the squad led by captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they came into the end zone with a very tight score of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You must always remember that we had a big lead at Valderram, as well as at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Valderram, where we won, but only narrowly", Bjorn said in the image, after watching the 2018 team win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to give Le Golf National a 10-6 lead.
So history and every member of that team showed me that it's not over.
You'll be bored tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
It's not over until all the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that's trying to win the trophy, and that's what we're focusing on.
I said I'd focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to stand for on the other side  the best players in the world.
Bjorn, delighted with the way his players played on a complex golf course, added: "I could never do it alone.
We're going to have another animal tomorrow.
There's a solo performance tomorrow, and it's too hard.
It's great to be out with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, your golfing ability is fully tested.
That's the message you have to give the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind, and he has to go out and get the best out of himself, too.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will take care that his players play better as individuals than as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these big twists when he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn, to then end up as a loser when Europe achieved the "Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word", he answered a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, encouraged his players to aim for the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you'd like to start as fast as Brooklyn, as fast as Medina.
When this pace goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those mid-matches.
So we set up a setup and made sure the boys felt like you know, like we were supposed to do a spell tomorrow.
Thomas was tasked with trying to take the counterattack and stand up to Rory McIlroy in a top-flight match against players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
I went with that group of boys in this order because I think it covers the whole trip, Bjorn said of his singles selection.
The German new warship again delayed
The latest German naval frigate was approved in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but will not be available for at least another year due to faulty systems and snow-covered shores, local media reported.
The launch of the lead ship Rheinland-Pfalz, a brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, citing an army spokesman.
The vessel was to become part of the Navy in 2014, but difficult problems after delivery have disrupted the fate of this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They will obviously be equipped with powerful guns, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft ballistic missiles, and some hidden technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important functions include long maintenance times  it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside the home port.
But the continuing delays mean that the advanced naval vessels  supposed to enable Germany to send troops overseas  will be obsolete by the time they are put into service, notes Die Zeit.
The notorious F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the manufacturer after it was delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of major software errors and metal elemental defects that would render the warship unusable for combat.
The software defects were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessel will be manned by a crew of some 120 sailors , which is half the workforce needed on the Bremen-class frigates.
It also showed that the ship was considerably overweight, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future innovation.
It is believed that the 7,000-tonne ship Rheinland-Pfalz will be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the metal element flaw, the cost of the entire project is also a problem  including crew training.
The price is said to have risen from the original 2.2 billion euros to a staggering 3.1 billion euros.
The problems with the latest frigates have become more important, especially in light of recent warnings that German naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defence committee, confirmed that the navy was indeed lacking in deployable ships.
This representative stated that the problems were continuously repackaged as the old ships were decommissioned but no replacements were provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were capable of becoming part of the Navy's fleet.
The National Trust is listening to the secret lives of bats
A new study is underway at a bat habitat in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
There is hope that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities of this species.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the whistling and the smallest brown-length and aquatic bat at the Inverewe Gardens Botanical Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key areas of this bat habitat to monitor bat activity throughout the year.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's calls and what the individual species are doing.
A map of their habitat and a report will be released to provide a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will show which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they use them.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating a loop, and best practices for maintaining forested areas for bats and other related species.
The population of Scotland and the whole of Britain has been declining in the last century.
They are threatened by the construction and territorial development affecting the colonies and the natural environment.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as fly traps and chemical treatments of building materials and cat attacks, can also be a risk.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an ingenious echo-location technique to track bugs and obstacles in flight.
NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, colonial inspections, and sometimes rescue work.
This organization even established the first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The manager of the neighborhood, David Thompson, says it's the perfect territory for them.
"We have a great bat area here in Threave", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and the best habitat.
But there is still too much we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive.
It highlights the importance of bat control before the start of maintenance work in real estate, as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of one parent nest could kill up to 400 females and young, which could destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's Bat Conservation Trust, is encouraging the public to join in and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and a lot of species we don't know how their populations are doing".
Ronaldo denies the rape charges and his lawyers are about to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations "fake news" and said people want to make themselves visible by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which reported on these charges.
This Portuguese and Juventus striker was accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep the case quiet, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Hours after the indictment was announced, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers, calling the information "false news".
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you know what?
What they said today is fake news, said the five-time Golden Ball Award winner.
They want to feed on my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their job.
I'm happy and I'm fine, said the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are about to sue Der Spiegel for unfounded charges that they described as "unacceptable reporting on suspicions in the private sector".
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player will be seeking compensation for moral damage equal to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent times.
The alleged incident was supposed to have taken place in June 2009 in the suite of the Palms Hotel and casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the gym, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told her he was 99 percent and one percent disappointed.
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed he paid for the sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she feared retaliation and public humiliation.
The 34-year-old woman says she's now trying to get back on track because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo has been accused of attacking Real Madrid since joining Manchester United and was bought by the famous Italian club Juve for 100 million euros this summer.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret the loss of carmakers
Britain will forever regret losing its status as a world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, said company secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was concerning that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"A deal is necessary", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said that the impact of border delays could cost jobs if no Brexit deal is reached.
At the Burnaston plant where Toyota  manufactures Auris and Avensis, almost 150,000 cars were produced last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"My view is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would have seen production at our factory shut down", said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, are spreading fears of leaving the EU without a deal as far as the functioning of cross-border trade is concerned.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers describe as supply chain risks in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on a timely basis with parts from UK and EU suppliers delivered to custom-built cars within 37 minutes.
If the UK left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be a disruption at the border, which could lead to delays and a lack of spare parts, according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to have a stock part for more than one day at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and thereby stop production.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plans to restore future relations with the EU were "curately calibrated to prevent these border checks".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that allows, as I say, not only the current success, but also the opportunity to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely capable of continuing what is a highly successful supply chain set.
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be halted, but warns that in the long run the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately also hurt jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been at Burnaston for 24 years and is the chairman of the unions at the plant, said that the members of the trade union organisations are increasingly concerned: 'I have experience that once these places disappear, they will never return.
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House says
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with acting attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week as the battle for the office of chief justice continues with Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of the Robert Mueller Special Counsel, which investigates Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible judicial obstructions by the president.
Whether Trump fires the acting Attorney General and threatens Mueller's independence, Washington's balls have been full for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he arrived at the White House surrounded by reports that he was resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he would rather not leave Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the full Senate vote once again.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox news on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date yet, it may be this week, it may need to be postponed to another week, given everything else going on at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'll always keep the news up to date.
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders hasn't held a press conference with the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences were not caused by aversion to the TV reporter's television show, although she said: "I disagree with the fact that she's going out".
She then suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more questions-and-answer sessions than any president before him", she added, without providing any evidence.
The conferences will continue, Sanders said, but if the press had the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it would undoubtedly be better than interviewing me.
We're trying it out, and you've seen that we've been doing it for the last few weeks and that we're having a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly receives questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting senior officials.
Independent press conferences are a rarity.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why with his relaxed and sometimes bizarre look in front of a gathering of reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU NHS Scotland staff not to be afraid of Brexit
The Health Minister wrote to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express their gratitude and wishes that they would remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman's MSP sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to settle the costs of EU citizens' settlement applications for transfers of public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: The UK-EU withdrawal negotiations continue through the summer, and they are heading towards an expected decision this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also taking steps to prepare for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
So I would like to reassure you how much I appreciate the contributions of every member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and our fervent wish is that you stay here.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee Tigers defensive end Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the side of the line and he just collapsed", Reed said.
The coaches and paramedics put Abercrombie on the sideline with oxygen and then put him on the carrier and prepared him for further evaluation.
A Tennessee state official told Chrisz Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there were no details on the type/scale of the injury available and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, second in the red jersey, is in his first season for Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five total moves before the end of the game on Saturday, which is a total of 18 moves in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when they buy property in the UK, with the additional money being used to help the homeless under the new Torah plans
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Increasing the higher property tax liability will apply to non-payers of taxes in the UK
The state budget is expected to increase by £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will pay higher property taxes when they buy property in the UK, with the extra money being used to help homeless people, Theresa May announced today.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with a promise to provide more affordable housing and focus on high-income people.
The increase in property tax will apply to individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, while the money will further strengthen government efforts to fight sleepless sleep.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current obligation to pay property tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for other homes and for rental purchases, may be up to 3%.
The state treasury is expected to increase by up to £120 million a year.
Estimates say that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, driving down prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get on the house ladder.
Many of the country's rich areas, especially the capital, have become ghost towns because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new rules came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a real estate tax cut to help more young people get their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by taking up land but not using it, and he urged Mrs May to withdraw quotas from affordable homes to fix the housing shortage in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a number of proposed housing reforms, including rental management and ending unnecessary evictions.
He also wants to increase the powers of committees to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I wanted to devote my efforts as Prime Minister to reviving the British dream so that every new generation can have a better life.
And that means fixing our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and shape their lives here.
However, it cannot be right to make it easy for non-UK residents and for foreign companies to buy houses as well as hardworking UK residents.
For many people, the dream of home is too remote and the disgrace of sleeping without a roof over their heads is too real.
My highest ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland boss Jack Ross has stated that his highest ambition is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scott is looking forward to the challenge of re-establishing the North East club, who are currently third in the Premier League, just three degrees below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a grade B and that's it, Ross said on BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that's always something that pulls me back.
But such an opportunity would only come if I were successful in leading the club.
Ross's predecessors as managers of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says he felt no anxiety about following such established names at such a big club when he had previously turned down pre-season play from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at the time was measured by whether I could get this club back into the Premier League.
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League, he said.
It's not an easy task to get him back, but I think I'd feel successful if I could get the club back.
Ross's been in the leadership business for only three years, having previously worked as an assistant manager at Dumarton and spent 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier and transformed St Mirren from a relegation to a championship title the following season.
And Ross says he feels much better now than he's ever felt in his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was probably a real crossroads, reminiscent of the time when Alloa was captured.
I really believed that leading was the right thing for me, more than acting.
It sounds strange, because I was good, making a good living and enjoying my height.
But playing can be challenging.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still go through them in terms of the stress and the pressure of the job, but I just feel good about leadership.
I always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm doing it, and I feel like I feel most in my skin right now in my entire adult life.

The summer heat wave boosted the revenues of struggling British pubs, but it increased the pressure on the restaurant chain.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consultancy, who produced the final reports, said: "Sustainable sunsets and longer than expected England's participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous July, when pub attendance increased by 2.8 percent, but restaurants were hit even more.
The decline in restaurant sales by 1.8 percent in June worsened in July.
The hosts and bars that tempt the drink have done the most to date, just as the restaurants have done the worst.
Hosts whose main revenues are from food also suffered from the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between the controlled values and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent for the month, while sales of food decreased by 3 percent.
Paul Newman of a leisure and hospitality analytics firm said: "These results are a continuation of a trend that has been going on since late April.
The weather and the impact of significant social or sporting events are the main factors when selling outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that restaurant chains continue to struggle, even though the 4.8 percent annual drop in sales will be particularly painful in the face of ongoing cost pressures.
A long hot summer cannot be a worse time for food-loving business operators, and time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring much needed relief.
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand presentation.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with combined turnover in excess of £9 billion, an established industry benchmark in the industry.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One in five children aged just 11 has a secret social media account hidden from parents and educators, research shows
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fake Instagram pages
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students said they have a parent-account
One in five children  by the age of just 11  create social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts where they share photos.
Reports indicate that there are concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a checked-in primary account that their parents know about, and they also have a private account.
A mother who came across a secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found that her teenage daughter was encouraging others to rape her.
A survey by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 per cent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half admitting to running private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and educators can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes on the Scottish Athletics Committee.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the steering committee.
Doyle is the most highly regarded lightweight athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those in the sport's leadership as those who will benefit from her extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh is widely respected in the Scottish, British and international athletics communities and we are confident that she will be of great benefit to Scotland's athletics community by joining the committee", said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to be the voice of athletes and I hope to be truly helpful and help lead the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, won a total of four gold medals and is now a regular BBC expert, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "I survived the attack a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it would take time to see if I would recover or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and I'm doing exercise today!
Thank you for all the encouraging news!
Milk thinner comparing mothers to cows shares opinions online
An online breastfeeding company has shared opinions about advertisements that compare nursing mothers to nursing cows.
As part of the launch of the world's first wearable silent breastfeeding device, consumer technology company Envi has released a music video with a caption showing the freedom the new breastfeeding device gives to mothers.
Four real mothers dancing in a barn full of hay with cows to a song with the lyrics: "Yes, I'm breastfeeding, but you don't see any tails, and if you haven't noticed I'm not fat, here are my breasts".
The choir continues: "Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I feed my sweet milk".
However, the advertisement posted on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy online.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom said it sheds light on the horrors of the dairy industry.
A very poor decision to abuse cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, they have to be pregnant and give birth to give milk, but their babies are taken away a few days after birth, says one commenter.
Elvie's breast feeder is placed discreetly on the breast (Elvie/mother)
Another comment: Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?
Someone else added, "This ad is totally out of the question.
There were also those who opposed the ad, with one woman admitting that she considered the song "expressive".
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy the pump if I was still breastfeeding.
When I suck, I feel just like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but it's for the job.
It's a brilliant product, wrote one user.
Another added: "It's a fun commercial for mothers who suck their milk (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like cattle.
It's not an advertisement to praise or condemn the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women is shown dancing with their braces hidden in their silhouettes.
The campaign's concept is based on the observation that many women who suck milk report feeling like cows.
However, Elvie's breastfeeding kit is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and is beautifully hidden in a breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold a baby, and even walk while breastfeeding.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD for mothers, added: Elvia's delivery is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a prominent and provocative launch.
By creating a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and breastfeeding cows, we wanted to highlight the challenges of breastfeeding and all the challenges that come with it, while showing the fun and reliable incredible sense of freedom that the new breastfeeding machine will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's vacuum has been on the outside.
During London Fashion Week, one of the two mothers of designer Marta Jakubowski, who was just using the product, showed up at the mall.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply despite the fact that monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in particular because the tough rhetoric and policies implemented by the Trump administration have made it difficult to accommodate children.
Most of the accompanying people were traditionally undocumented immigrants who feared that their ability to stay in the country would be threatened, so they claimed to belong to a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would be required to provide fingerprints and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement testified before Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who had requested escort status for isolated minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Up to 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of the sponsors' households are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we're continuing to pursue them, Mr. Albence said.
According to the asylum workers, in an effort to process children's cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear before the court within a month of detention, instead of the previous standard 60 days.
Many will appear via videoconference instead of in person to declare their case as legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer the child is in custody, the more likely he is to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to anger outbursts or attempts to escape, according to asylum workers, reporting from the system over the past few months.
Lawyers say that these concerns are heightened in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child suffering are more likely to go unnoticed, precisely because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent camp without enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could trigger the trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria has announced that the US, French and Turkish occupation forces will withdraw immediately
During a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual also called for the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, even as the country is now in its eighth year of war.
Mo'al, who is also acting prime minister, said foreign forces in Syria were illegal, under the guise of fighting terrorism and that they would be handled accordingly.
"He must surrender immediately and unconditionally", he told the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the war on terrorism in Syria is almost over, with more than 360,000 people killed and millions more displaced since 2011.
He said Damascus will continue to fight in this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territory of terrorist groups and any illegal aliens present.
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the territory of war-torn countries.
In issuing the refugees, Moualem declared that the conditions for their return were good and accused some Western countries of spreading irrational concerns that made them unwilling to return.
'We have contacted international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns,' he said.
Politicize what should be purely a humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no recovery aid will be available to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a protective zone in Idlib's last refuge has provided an opportunity to move political discussions further.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement has clearly set deadlines and expressed hope that the military intervention would target jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters linked to Al Qaeda, who would be eliminated.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections will take place soon.
Mo'al set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to checking the articles of the existing constitution, and issued a warning against interference.
Why Trump Won the Second Term
According to this logic, Donald Trump would win another election in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers are hoping, the impeachment and scandal ended his early inauguration as president.
In that case, it would undoubtedly be the most dramatic presidential term finale in history!
So far, there's no sign of the viewer's fatigue.
Since 2014, mainstream viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average viewership of 2.4 million during prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC has increased cable viewership to 3.5 million viewers of prime time news.
"It's a heat that attracts people because it's something we don't understand", Neal Baer, host of "Designated Survivor", told ABC's drama about a cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and producer on Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because he's funny", Mrs. Scovell told me.
It's the meaning of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, a story set in Washington could predetermine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and for the benefit of the global economy.
The adjustment is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen to watch a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward is using the deep backup resources for his book Fear, the $15,000 worth of Paul Manafort's leather jackets and the consequences of Trump's disgusting portrayal of Storm Daniels' anatomy.
I'm not going to look at Super Maria the same way again, among other things.
"Part of what the reality show does and makes you feel is that it feeds you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of Pawn Stars documentary about the NFL's rotating Trump program, in which he praises Kim Jong-un.

When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny out on the north shore of Kauai, 80 degrees, but he was stuck inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't break away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood up to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in jeopardy.
"I remember doing all these crazy shows and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
I think it was supposed to be a joke, but they were right.

Money flows out into the tightest domestic race of the midterm elections
No wonder Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is experiencing a financial flurry following the reorganization of congressional districts that generated two officeholders fighting for the same seat.
This recently led to the transformation of the Pittsburgh suburban district into a district Democratic Republican Conor Lamb, who won another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is up against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which overlaps strongly with the new 17.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans, the maps were redrawn.
The race in the new 17th District has sparked a sharp financial dispute between the main party's financial branches, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became famous in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March special election for the 18th Congressional District.
This seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight lead.
America is considering fining Salvador for supporting China, then retreating.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing under slight pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was staying at a hotel in Panama until the partners' organizing team of Trump's leadership was removed by court.
State Department officials have decided to remove the US diplomatic mission directors from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama based on recent decisions not to further recognize Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including funds for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included cutting financial aid and focused on visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
With ongoing internal negotiations, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity following a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants entering the United States.
But by mid-September, the top administration had made clear that they wanted to continue negotiations and effectively end any proposed fines for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of addressing the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of the signal the administration is putting in for talks, diplomats said.
And three American ambassadors have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new unconventional news from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on anonymity terms.
Their sources have been confirmed by an outside analyst close to the government executive who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The history of studies
The definitive nail in the coffin could be the report by Robert Mueller of the Special Commission on the possible obstruction of justice of Mr. Trump, which is now well documented in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also allegedly turning to whether Mr. Trump's campaign contained a secret agreement with Russia about an attack on our election.
If Congress were to change parties, Mr. Trump would have to report to this body, just as he is preparing to run for re-election, and eventually, a jury of his colleagues would likely be expected.
That's a whole lot of 'ifs', and I don't want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, as is the case with similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice that will affect how long our suffering will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, but it was enough for the Western powers to stand up and support him in Munich Czechoslovakia.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments that accelerate or slow down the relentless course of democracy.
The Americans are facing several similar critical moments.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who's running the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been in a state of shock ever since the report announced that he had proposed secretly filming the president last year and speculated that he was not medically fit to hold the office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the Times' versions are inaccurate.
What will we do if the newly requested FBI investigation of Bret Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite compelling sexual assault charges and perjury statements?
And most importantly, will we vote in the middle of the term for Congress to assign responsibility to Mr. Trump?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have a long dark night ahead of it.
But I believe we're not going to fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, on Saturday, she sent me to light candles on a table with a swastika.
With such a legacy, how could I not be optimistic about our future?
Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House.
Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna.
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over Austria in a remarkable draw in Spain at Villarreal earlier this month would give them high hopes for promotion from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury kept quarterback Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal have a good team", the 31-year-old said.
We went into a fight of faith that we could break something, and we got a point.
We might have had a few more at the end, but overall, the draw was fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we got better in the second half and we were better again.
Thursday is going to be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be hard because they scored a good result in the last game, but with the crowd behind me, I'm sure we can push and it'll work out well.
Last year was a tough year, with all my injuries and changes at the club, but I feel really good about it here.
The team's strong and the guys are really enjoying it, training is great too.
I hope we can get back to that now, put the past season behind us and be successful.
Women worry about saving for retirement
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how to care for them, few people spoke to their family members about the matter.
About half of the people in a nationwide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they'd talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't want to talk about it", explains Holly Snyder, vice president of the national life insurance company.
You can start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare a family for care unless you tell them what you want.
Discuss with your counselor and family how and where to receive care, as these factors can play a major role in determining the price.
Ask your financial advisor: A financial advisor can help you find a way to cover your expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, for example, by traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash life insurance to help you pay for these expenses, or by using your own insurance with your own funds  as long as you have money.
Create your legal documents: Avoid legal battles while you can.
You will appoint a health care representative who will be a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that doctors comply with your wishes if you cannot communicate with yourself.
Also consider writing full power to your finances.
You will choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your accounts are paid if you are not qualified to do so yourself.
Remember the details: Imagine that your grandparent is in urgent need of medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write down these details in your written plan so that you can be prepared.
"It's not just money in the game, but what are the names of the doctors who are nursing?" asks Martin.
Where are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have the plan in mind.
A man in Ilfracombe was shot several times from a jet.
As the man walked home from a night's work, he was hit by several air gun shots.
The victim, about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police described the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 BST, as a "coincident".
The attacker's victim didn't look.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening and police are looking for witnesses.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise, officials said.
Because of the communications being off-line, auxiliary units could not obtain any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palau that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated from Palau since the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the city of Palu and Donggala Regency, Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island and its population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency stretching for over 300 km (180 mi) along the northwestern coast of Sulawesi.
Regenthood, an administrative region under the provinces, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main components of the economy of Central Sulawesi province are fishing and agriculture, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, the tsunami has hit Pal and Donggala several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, the Donggale tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The tsunami struck western Donggala in 1996 and claimed nine lives.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here's a list of some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh province.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck south of Indonesia's most populous island of Java, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A light earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh Province, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastating effects of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami was formed, but over 100 died as a result of the collapsing buildings.
2018: A strong earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on assault charges.
According to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, disruption of domestic violence reporting, and resisting arrest.
When, according to police reports, his female acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, Palin took her phone.
Palin was sent to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reports.
According to the network's report, he appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he felt "decisively innocent" when asked to comment.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in jail and a fine of up to $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by one day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This isn't the first time Palin has faced a criminal complaint.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palina.
The alleged assault on the police was reported by his mother, Sarah Palin, on the phone.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, disrupting domestic violence reporting and possession of a weapon under the influence of intoxicants in connection with the incident.
He allegedly hit his girlfriend in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by war veterans groups in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by her son's service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications networks are down, and casualty numbers are expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck a striking part of Sulawesi Island, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
A video has appeared on social media depicting the moment of the disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palo when a tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding an exceptional death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in NYC.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, who is suspected of committing the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people.
Saipov, 30, allegedly attacked a cycleway on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October using a rented Home Depot truck that he used to smash pedestrians and cyclists.
To defend the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally caused a series of injuries.
According to court documents, both figures would mean the possibility of a death sentence.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including charges of extortion-related murder commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and charges of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
The attack required "clear planning and preparation", the applicants claim, describing the way Saip's act was carried out as heinous, cruel and perverse.
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clevese, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernán Ferruchi, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damián Pagnucca, is named in the order.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York last sentenced the death penalty.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was actually carried out was in a federal case in New York in 1953, when a married couple, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, were executed for conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs sat in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, expressed minimal regret in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he said he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching Islamic State videos on the phone.
Police also said he also demanded the Islamic State flag be hung in a hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were obviously disappointed by the prosecutors' decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea and a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved", Patton said.
The Saipov team of lawyers had previously asked the plaintiffs not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MPs say he should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged to mobilize the People's Army during today's protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians must 'feel pressure from Eurosceptics' as suggested by one of Theresa May's own MPs, he should lead the EU negotiations.
The senior Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that Britain would be out by now if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the problem that Mrs May faces in pacifying her ranks, where there is a deep divide, has been highlighted by conservatives fighting to stay in the EU who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep her compromise plan from Chequers going under the attack of Brexiters, EU staying and the EU itself.
The Allies insist that it will continue to seek an agreement with Brussels regardless of the consequences  and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and chaos.
Mr Bone has announced that Leave Means Leave is meeting in Solihull, where he wants to quit Chequers.
He suggested to Mr Farage that he should become a deputy and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd be out by today", he declared.
Member for Wellingborough added: 'I will support Brexit, but we must abandon Chequers.
To show his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We did not fight world wars to be obedient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that British citizens would change their minds and want to stay is completely wrong.
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins, who was also present at the march, told reporters: "I'm simply saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him, and he is not liked by members of our party or our activists who are currently filling the streets to get us elected at all.
Forget about the Chequers and start listening.
In a sharp message to Mrs. May, he says, "Prime Ministers will keep their positions if they keep their promises".
Mr Farage said that conservative politicians must 'get into an uncomfortable situation' if they want to betray their decision taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us people and our political class", he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're standing here today to tell them we're not going to let you do that".
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the pressure.
"We are now mobilizing the army of the people of this country who have secured our victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent and proud self-governing Britain".
Meanwhile, the EU's permanent representatives marched through Birmingham and then organised a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists waved banners of the Conservatives against Brexit after the party's opening weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives over the security concerns of the party's application after the conference began.
"These are the people who, in their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus plus, for trouble-free borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It's all a joke.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren is planning to seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future Saturday at a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She's been at the center of speculation that she might be able to compete with Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, which means women in the highest office.
He was arrested on suspicion of shooting Sims from LSU.
Baton Rouge, LA, police said Saturday they arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayda Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson at 11:00 ET news conference.
A video of Friday's shooting was released asking for the ID of the man caught on tape.
Sims, 20, was shot in the early hours of Friday near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a non-life-threatening gunshot wound to the head", police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde was trying to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to moving around the scene, to having a gun, and to the shooting of Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot-6, Baton Rouge native Sims played 32 games, 10 of them last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title as the team manager puts his hand in the victory over Sebastian Vettel
As soon as Valtteri Bottas finished ahead of Lewis Hamilton in Saturday's qualifying, it was clear that Mercedes' team-management would play a big part in the race.
From pole position, Bottas got off to a good start and almost got rid of Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two laps and called on Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the depot first and let Hamilton follow the cars that were driving the group's tail, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes rider crashed into the car park a few laps later and placed behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead and in a close fight the Ferrari rider had to reluctantly leave the inner lane open to defend himself in the third corner after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen took the lead at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for much of the time, holding the original tyres as long as possible to focus on a quick finish and to take Kimmy Raikkonen's fourth place.
He finally ran into the deck in round 44, but in the remaining eight laps he could no longer increase the pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he acted like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done a fantastic job and the prize is the top two places, Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday for insisting she had not released a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During his speech to a meeting in West Virginia, he did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead stated that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "good and disgusting and lying".
"One thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that's happening in the last days of Sennaar, when you see the anger, when you see those people, how angry and evil and repugnant and lying", he said.
When you look at the release and the release and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, can you get the escape?
Remember her answer... you published the document?
Oh, no, I'm not.
She didn't publish.
Well, wait a minute.
We published... no, no, no, he added and imitated the senator.
Feinstein sent a letter from Ford detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July and the information leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied any leak from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, nor did I disclose information about the case", said Feinstein, as reported by The Hill.
She asked me to keep everything a secret, and I did exactly what she asked me to.
But her words were apparently not taken seriously by the president, who spoke about the case at a meeting Saturday night: "I'll tell you, that's really bad body language.
She may not have, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president continues to defend a Supreme Court justice candidate who was accused of sexual harassment by three women, and has hinted that the Democrats are using these accusations for their own ends.
They are determined to take back power by whatever means they have.
You see, this viciousness, this disgust, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to put in the country to get back to power and the helm, "Mediate quoted the president's words.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars have repaired their Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants on Saturday's Dundee replay, which ended 5-3.
The Giants soon took a two-way lead thanks to the intervention of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were able to tie the game at home before Dwyer returned the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard then tied for Dundee again, with two goals from Lucas Lundwald Nielsen ensuring their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League this season for Adam Keefe's team, who managed to beat Belfast Dundee 2-1 on Friday.
The two teams met for the fourth time this season, with all three previous games being dominated by Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, with Kendall McFaul assisting, while David Rutherford credited the assist with Beauvillier's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild as Sullivan got home back in the game at 1:10 and then Matt Marquardt set a goal for Cownie, who tied the game at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants went into the booth at the first break, only in the lead, when he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first quarter.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again managed to tie the game with a time of 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran's joint work later helped Nielsen shift the lead to Dundee for the first time in the second quarter and the same player secured his team's lead in the final half-third.
The Giants, who have now lost their fourth of their last five games, will play their next game Friday at home in Milton Keynes.

More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake that caused the tsunami on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The strong earthquakes that followed flooded the area, and many people were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palá.
But despite the fact that fellow 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung was running for his life, he refused to leave his seat in the wild with a floating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pal.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was going down.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia's air traffic control spokesman Yohannes Sirait told ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We prepared a transport helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which was transported to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Paul.
"Our hearts are broken by this message", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities have expressed concern that the death toll could reach thousands, and the disaster management agency said access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is still rising because many bodies remain undiscovered under the wreckage and many of them have not yet been reached by rescuers", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said.
The waves in devastated Pala have reached a height of up to six meters, and a mass funeral will be held in the city on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft are bringing aid and supplies to the affected areas.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings in more bodies.
There's a shortage of drinking water.
Small shops are looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help survivors, but we don't know what they're actually going to find.
It's a tragedy already, but it could be worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pala on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night and complete all the tasks necessary to evacuate.
Are you ready? CNN reported.
This year, Indonesia was hit by the earthquake in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now claims one person is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline operating the plane that crashed into a lagoon on one of the Micronesian islands in the Pacific now reported one person missing, initially stating that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a press release that it was unable to locate a single man on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests to provide details about this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane went down in water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that a total of seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in treatment on Saturday and were all in a stable condition.
However, the cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The U.S. Air Force and Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before landing.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
American traveler Bill Jaynes reported that the plane was landing from a very low altitude.
"That was really good", Jaynes said.
Jaynes went on to say that he and the others had managed to get water through a deep belt to the emergency exits of a sinking aircraft.
He also said that the crew panicked and shouted and that he himself suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to repair the harbor pier helped rescue the passengers by using a paddle boat to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, a total of 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-marked aircraft over the past two decades, but no crashes have occurred to Air Niuguni.
Analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The prosecution closed its speech on Saturday in this case, in which a man is repeatedly convicted of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice, in the name of its analyst Paul Rowlett, has been testifying for several hours and providing expert advice in the field of intelligence analysis.
A jury analyst outlined a scenario using cell phone records from the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was at Chambers's on the night of her death, contrary to his previous testimony, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the cell phone data showed that he spent the night with Chambers, he found out he was with his friend Michael Sanford, who was then approached by the police.
Sanford testified before the court in the council that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth about being in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was lying because my car was in Nashville that night.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
But the cell phone records show the two had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be brought before the jury later that day.
What is conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to deal with negative opinions about the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol-based band High Breed claim that hip hop has moved from its beginnings to political messages and social issues.
So they want to go back to their roots and re-populate conscious hip hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have already experienced a resurgence in the recent past thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black woman?!
New York City educator sues a couple for firing her after a racist text message
A New York-based nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misspelled text message from her mother, which marked her as another black woman's text message.
A couple denied they were racist and compared the lawsuit to extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed shock on her first day at work in 2016 when she learned that her new child's guardian, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent her to Miss Maurice twice.
When she realized her faux pas, the troubled Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, saying that her outgoing African-American nanny was doing really badly and that she was expecting the Philippines instead, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one job and sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for dismissal and asking for $350 for the day of the six-month engagement she was initially hired for, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that this is not happening", she told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
But the two responded by saying that they were not racist but that it was appropriate to terminate Mrs. Maurice's employment, for they feared that after that insult they would no longer trust her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are not racists, her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
But would you trust your child with someone you treated cruelly, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn child?
Come on, you know what?
Plasco likened the lawsuit to extortion, saying that his wife was only caring for a two-month-old baby and was in a very difficult situation.
Would you drive someone like that?
That's not a nice thing at all, said the investment banker.
Although the court case is still ongoing, the social media jury very quickly convicted the two for their behavior and logic.
Publishers of Paddington's Bears were concerned that readers might not identify with the talking bear, the latest news shows.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was published, told reporters: "It's hard to feel like someone reading it for the first time before it's even published.
It's very funny to know, now that we know the great success of the Paddington Bear.
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book about a small teddy bear, was very disappointed that his work was rejected, and submitted the book on the 60th anniversary of its publication, which became a "sweet bitterness" after his death last year.
To Paddington, whom she describes as a very important member of her family, she added that her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a very quiet man, never a very boastful man", she said.
But since Paddington was such a real person to him, it was like having a child who achieved something you can be really proud of.
I believe he looked at Paddington's success with this view.
Although it was his only creations and imaginations, he always tried to attribute all his successes to Paddington alone.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louise Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that it was really bad and that he didn't expect her to get out of it", said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nada, and she told me she was going to die in two minutes, and I had to say goodbye.
So I did.
I said, "Tash, I love you very dearly.
I'll be there with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
The drugs doctors gave her to keep her heart going slowly lost their effectiveness and left her body.
She died shortly afterwards, and it was like everything was closed.
I just had to sit around and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it to myself.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, not revealing the difficult test she was undergoing.
No one knew about it, she said.
I kept my head down, tears running down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt an amazing understanding of Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Women in mourning send out cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending out Welsh Bridge postcards with inspirational messages and phone numbers for people to call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and, as a result, took his own life at 18.
"I wouldn't want any other parent to feel what I felt every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son was a gifted young cook with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile could light up every room.
However, he left work before he died because it was a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother's still body after taking his own life.
Mrs Davis says, "I'm constantly worried about the impact it will have on his life".
Mrs. Davis designed the cards to inform people that they have people available to help them and to talk to them, even if they are their friends.
Don't sit quietly You have to talk
Mrs. Humphreys, who is Mrs. Davies's longtime girlfriend, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"Nothing told me he was feeling down or depressed, nothing at all", she explains.
Then a few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
The worst thing was on Christmas Day when the kids opened the presents, and he didn't even look at them, nothing.
She said that the death of her partner was a huge trauma for them, but that she had to get over it gradually: "This kind of thing can make a big hole in the family.
It tore us apart.
But we all have to go ahead and fight.

The future of Bret Kavanaugh depends on the balance of the FBI's investigation.
"I thought we could get something that was actually requested by the investigation in time constraints, with limited scope, we could bring a little unity to it", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was worried the committee would break up because both sides would be burying their seats after partisanship.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to open an investigation?
Their resistance is timely.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6, and if the Republicans do as expected, it will lead to their significant weakening in their attempts to nominate the man they want to the highest court in this country.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbied for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for President Bush, and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary at the time.
What happens if the FBI compiles its report?
The Senate will vote on it, and there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Still, it's unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which allowed Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugee numbers under Kim have fallen
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has declined since the beginning of Kim Jong-un's rule seven years ago, South Korean lawmakers say.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said that there were 1127 flights over the past year  compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr Park further stated that this was due to stricter controls at the border between North Korea and China and higher rates required for smugglers at the border.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are now being offered South Korean citizenship.
Sool claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border.
Most of them are fleeing through China, with which North Korea has the longest border and is easier to cross than in the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South  which are still technically at war  have improved markedly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on halting denuclearization talks.
This was the case at the historic June meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive terms of cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho accused the United States of not making any progress on sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances there is no way for us to unilaterally disarm ourselves", Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Democratic minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament made him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this remark in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if any woman ever performed a play like this, they would call it 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said in her response to Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations of sexually assaulting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while they were both in puberty.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and choking as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, saying that their accusations against him were a "grotesque and coordinated attack" by liberals who failed to get over Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony proved he was unable to work for the Supreme Court because he showed a bias against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself by these statements and the way he relied on the Clintons and Democrats", she said.
Pelosi answered in the negative when asked whether she would seek Kavanaugh's impeachment if confirmed even if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
I'll tell you this. If he's not telling the truth to Congress, then he's not only qualified to work for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he's working for now, Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals .
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was worried about Kavanaugh's potential courtroom payoffs under the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he's considered a conservative judge.
In the previous hearings of his confirmation of office, Kavanaugh avoided answering the question of whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"There's no time for a hysterical, preconceived person to go to court and expect us to just say, 'Yeah, that's beautiful,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to rule it.
After months and years of verbal abuse, she couldn't get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do I?
She goes on to say, "A woman who once was the principal helped me a lot, and she told me that she cries when she's angry, but she's developed a technique that means that when she's angry and she's crying, she tells the person she's talking to, 'You might think I'm crying because I'm sad.
But I'm angry.
And so she continued.
And I think that's great.
Tears are acceptable as a means of reacting to anger, in part because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job working in a male-dominated office, where I once expressed my inexpressible anger by crying, but an older, always cold manager, who was always a little bit scared, grabbed my neck and pulled me up the stairs.
"Never show them you're crying", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they got you.
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an affair on board the Monkey Business and had to withdraw from the battle, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found there was no reason why she could not explore the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
"It was not a well thought out decision", she said with a laugh after 30 years.
There were seven other candidates running, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snowflake and the Seven Dwarfs".
But because the campaign was already going on for a long time, she couldn't keep up with the crowdfunding and she vowed not to enter the game unless she made $2 million in donations.
It was a losing battle.
She found out that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate would only give her $250.
"Does he think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally run the campaign, she was completely overcome by her emotions  as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult for her to raise money and focusing on the voters rather than the delegates and anger at sexism, she choked herself to death.
"You might think I've been nervous", Mrs. Schroeder said of the press' response.
And you might think that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they might write on my gravestone.

Why can a Sino-American trade war be good for Beijing?
The initial wave of the US-China trade war was deafening, and although the battle is not far from being won, experts say the gap between the countries is in the long run beneficial to Beijing.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, gave the first warning this year by taxing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
However, most of the major escalations saw the light of day this week when new tariffs were announced on $200 billion (£150 billion) of goods, which means virtually taxing half of China's trade exports to the US.
Beijing has reacted every time, most recently by imposing tariffs on five to 10 percent of the 60 billion U.S. imports.
China has tried to pay the US the same price, and it's unlikely that the world's second-largest economy would get down on its knees.
Even if China wanted Washington back to its original roots, it would have meant giving in to its demands, but publicly submitting to American demands would have been utterly humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts believe that if Beijing could play its cards right, a US trade war could positively support China in the long run, as it would reduce the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact is that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would trigger an economic upheaval in both countries, which is far more dangerous than observers have admitted", said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Center for New American Security think tank focused on Asia.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today's situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to a normal state.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees forced to leave the country by terrorism are now met, as are unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million people have been displaced from Syria since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moual said the Syrian regime welcomed any assistance in building the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the insurgents.
Europe responded sharply to the Ryder Cup win in Paris
Team Evria won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the brink of difficulty in France.
The United States now lost for the sixth time in a row on European soil, thus not winning the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The US star, Phil Mickelson, who was bothered most of the tour, then threw the ball into the water on 3 pairs of 16 holes and gave up the win to Francesco Molinarim.
Italian golfer Molinari then shone through all his laps, becoming one of only four players to achieve a best 5-0-0 result since the current format was approved in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5 and 4 by the lowest-rated European player, Thorbjørn Olesen of Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who was likely to qualify for his last Ryder Cup.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the top European player overall with 25.5 points scored in his career.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, really happy, to have won the cup back.
It's all about the team, I'm glad I could help, Garcia said after winning Europe.
He gave a cup to his fellow countryman John Ramp, who on Sunday beat American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles.
"I'm incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I've grown up watching this guy", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 of the greatest titles, which only Jack Nicklaus can compare to.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find the fairway, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the USA, after his team's disappointing results, said, "I'm proud of the boys, they really fought.
This morning, we really warm up Europe.
We really didn't make it.
I'm waving my hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players were really good.
We're gonna regroup and work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee to move forward.
I love those 12 guys, I'm glad I could make them captain.
I really need to slip.
You've outplayed us.
Red tide update: Concentration decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota counties
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission points to a total decline in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, flowering water spots are now reported from Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties  indicating decreasing concentrations.
The flowering waters of the Red Stream stretch about 130 miles of coastline from Pinellas County north to Lee County south.
The spots were spotted about 10 miles off the coast in Hillsborough County, but last week, there were relatively few spots.
Red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, moderate concentrations were reported in coastal or open sea areas near Pinellas County, with Hillsborough County having observed low to high concentrations in the open sea, low to high concentrations in Manatee County, low to high concentrations in coastal or open sea areas near Sarasota County, low to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, low to high concentrations in coastal or open sea areas near Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory irritation continues to occur in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No airway disturbance was reported in northwest Florida last week.
