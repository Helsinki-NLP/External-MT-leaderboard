Republican strategy to oppose Obama's re-election
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policies with the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth by reaffirming that electoral fraud in the United States is more rare than the number of people killed by the flash.
The Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States over the last 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voting participation.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the U.S. democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in each country.
In this sense, the majority of U.S. governments have since 2009 announced new laws that make it difficult for the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon gained significance after the November 2010 elections, where 675 new Republican representatives were registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 countries.
The new electoral law requires voters to submit a light image card and a proof of U.S. citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws also shorten the periods for premature voting, the right to register as voters on the day of the election, and the citizens the right to vote for which a court act is available.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to show a light image card.
Indiana was the first state to raise such a claim.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
The Republican authorities agreed to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted bills in 34 states for making voters compelled to show a light image.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal certificate like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, meaning 21 million voting persons, do not have a light image card issued by a government authority in their state.
Moreover, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a passport.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often to be paid to get the required passport.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affected by young people, minorities and people with low income.
In fact, 25% of Afro-Americans, 15% of people with a income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age don’t have the required light image certificate.
This is enough further.
Students who are considered to be voters who give their votes increasingly for democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use their light image card issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of angels or hunting unions who are more voting for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these unions for elections.
Before 2004, no state required a proof of citizenship for the election.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voices.
Because it’s out of hand that two out of three Spanish voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In 2011, Republican legislators in eight states promoted laws abolishing the registration of voters on the day of the election.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to help those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the voter registration campaigns at the 2004 general elections helped register about 10 million citizens.
As a result of the measures adopted since 2009, the percentage of registration of new accountants in 2010 has decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators in five other states have adopted laws aimed at shortening the period for premature voting.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were Afro-Americans, although they are only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Spanish population.
The latter made only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
On the contrary, the white, who represented 76% of the voters, only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills were blocked by the veto of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened in order to expose the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws that require the display of a light image.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of the voting right difficult.
The democratic critics reject the party-political nature of the adopted laws and see in them as a clear goal the influence of the results in the decisive countries for 2012.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states that have adopted these laws are 171 out of the 270 votes required in the electoral body to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these amendments to the legislation on the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voting participation.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the U.S. democratic system.
Early detection of prostate cancer: should the test be done or not?
The PSA test actually shows sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or also false positive results, leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a stronger hesitation of the already unresolved men for the conduct of early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We received the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the U.S. there were numerous disturbances between the control groups, which makes it difficult to interpret these data and give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that in a post-observation after 12 years, the likelihood of formation of metastases is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection was carried out.
That’s why I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also at a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must be truly understood the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options where prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long run, and in these cases it is more likely to opt for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and is not a threat to their lives.
They are proposed for active monitoring and they are offered treatment when the disease progresses.
With increasing accuracy, the criteria for a decision are determined, who should be treated and who not.
However, I recommend the test.
But the most important thing is to talk to your doctor to determine whether it should be performed or not.
In collaboration with the International Society for Urology, Movember has developed a tool that allows you to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle remedy to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress in research, accepting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of getting sick.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer could be prevented if everyone ate well and moved enough.
“If there were no smokers anymore, this value would rise to at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancer diseases are caused by inheritance.
Many of them remain completely unclear.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, fighting tobacco dependency remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It greatly damages the health of people.
“Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Incentive data: 10 years after you quit smoking, the risk of dying from cancer decreases by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, cartilage, gastrointestinal, stomach, abdominal and uterine cancer.
“The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against cervical cancer,” he adds.
The nutrition
The organization also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat.
In too large amounts, it increases the risk of developing a grimm or gastrointestinal cancer.
The roots should also be removed.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, their investigations are not conclusive at the moment.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed a more likely increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly shown.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes how important it is to talk to his doctor about his concerns and his family pre-load.
“The conduct of a early detection test does not lead to cancer.”
The Higgs Boson Analysis
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson has raised a certain appearance last summer, and this for a good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it’s the last particle, whose existence has been predicted by the standard model – our best or “at least false” explanation of nature and the behavior of matter – but has not yet been empirically observed.
But for the physicists it is not completely sure that it is really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
Furthermore, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a large physics congress in Kyoto, but there is still a lack of data to be completely sure about it.
However, let’s assume that it’s actually the Higgs, as it seems that there’s only a small risk of lying, and let’s look at what it’s about.
There is in this world a necessarily unnecessary law that causes two objects not to be present at the same time in the same place.
It’s not possible to violate this rule – and don’t try it too strong as you’re going to get hurt.
For even if particle physics is a truly strange world, it turns out that there is also such a law for them: the Pauli’s exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same “quantum state”, with this “state” in general consisting of some of their properties.
Based on this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens who are called Fermione and who are kindly obedient to the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the Bosons are moving, a bad band of anarchists, to whom nothing is holy - not that principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
According to The Particle Adventure, these bosons are divided into two groups from the Berkeley Laboratories (which is surprisingly amazing): the mesons that we will not treat here and the "power parts" through which the great powers of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
But it must be emphasized here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of exceptional banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "boat" of the electromagnetic power.
In fact, if a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "interrupted" exactly in that place, about like a steel stone thrown into a shell.
Through this “disruption” a electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) is created, and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons “tender of power”.
more stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, has to be "interrupted" to make this boson appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the causer has to reach very high energies, slightly comparable to a frozen roof, whose surface could only be broken by a very large rock.
That’s why a huge particle accelerator like the CERN is needed – the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a range of 27 km! – to reach such energies.
The analogue with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, they are not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never keep itself in the refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it own a mass, while the others (like the photon) do not own a mass.
For what all of these research can now be "good," Mrs Plamondon asks?
For science, they serve the review of the standard model (SM), and they also enable physicists to thoroughly examine all deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are many physicists who seem to hope that such deviations will be found, as the smallest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter still has great shortcomings, as it does not provide an explanation for the gravity (up!) and the dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (re-up!).
However, such deviations have not been found in the CERN so far.
Effects
The effects of these research on the general population are harder to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the deceased physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who in 1962 developed the first durable laser (the first were pulsted) - has already said that the laser was in the beginning considered a "laboratory play".
Imagine yourself...
In addition, applications can also come from all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, again, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in optics in 1969.
Although it wasn’t the original purpose, this sensor today serves as the “eye” of all digital cameras around the world and has given it the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it means that you can never really know it.
Palliative Care – The Best Way to Die – Le Devoir
With her committee for “Death in Dignity”, Quebec recently discussed the weak issue of the end of life.
The debate needs to be rebuilt soon, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, there is still a lot to do in this important topic.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this closer.
A few weeks ago Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that caused him had left him a period of two years.
“They gave me five years to live, I’ve managed seven years,” he said half-hearted, in his bed at the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived the previous day.
“But it’s always a shock, you can’t be prepared for it,” he says.
The disease does his work: an immense weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting on the table before a delicious lunch, he resigns to let himself help with the meal.
Courageously, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medications, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My greatest desire is that you heal my diarrhea because this is humiliating,” he says.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for this evil.
“Thro our lives we experience a man standing,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois’ home.
Return to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
“It depends on the person’s ability to take a step back, he notes.
For, according to the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great events take place in the middle of these feedback.
Patients who are referred to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they will no longer be overwhelmed by the doctors and nurses who take care of them with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die “consciously and through revival.”
But through the illness I really met my children.
“I have good kids,” she added.
“I don’t have any wishes in life anymore,” she says before she accepts to put on a mask to help her breathe.
In the next few days, she is still waiting for a last visit to her son, who comes from Italy.
At Home Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers offers body care and food support.
The palliative care is then used when there are no other possibilities.
To make death more pleasant.
In Quebec, 11,700 inhabitants receive a palliative care bed.
This is very little if we take into account that one day we will all die.
Here life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The person who dies is given oral care with brandy or pepsi.
Diabetics no longer have to control their blood sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer to the feet of the dead.
“We’re helping families and patients equally,” says Nathalie Savard, Director of Nursing.
In the house of Victor-Gadbois there is no day like the other.
In addition to a 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family meeting in the courtyard and is well supported by his headsets while attacking his honor, a 36-year-old man, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children, dies tragically after he has tried everything to survive.
“For six months, three to five beds have always been documented with cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients sent to Victor-Gadbois home come from their residence, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to a care aimed at relieving the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, either at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Home Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Home Palliative Care in the Great Montreal Area specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great insufficiency in Quebec’s health care ensures that several physicians specializing in palliative care face concerns with the adoption of a law regulating death aid and assisted suicide.
Since the month of October, a manifesto has been in circulation, which has been signed by prominent personalities of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to declare their objection to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system of Quebec is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone has the right to high-quality palliative care before accepting to go to death aid.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in emergency receipt without taking measures to relieve them.
I am afraid that the patients want to die only because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite the worst forecasts, forgotten until the last day.
Hélène Richard's survival chances were already minimal when she interrupted a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I’m going to break the treatment, she replied to me that she’s sorry that I’m giving up the fight, she told me.
She told me I was at the end.
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die thank the care staff that this desire has not occurred after their pain has been relieved by a palliative care team.
But it must be clearly said that palliative care in pain treatment is not omnipotent.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care of the Montreal large-scale palliative care company, 8% of patients don’t talk to a pain treatment.
At the end of life, therefore, doctors often take back to the terminal sedation, which goes beyond sleeping the patient either sporadically or permanently until the moment of his death.
We can no longer do as if we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will be increasingly likely to use this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved, all say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean, “I want you to sleep me,” but “I want my pain to be relieved.”
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutions.
Real Estate Scandal in Quebec
Officials of the road building office, corporations of the construction industry, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system" in which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unions and mafioso are stuck.
A "industry" that was very expensive for the taxpayer of Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s strange how the system has broken down since drastic action has been taken,” laughs Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec deputy and former head of the police of Montreal.
The scandal was revealed by him due to a thorough investigation of the disturbances related to the road construction contracts in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had only dismissed.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct connection between the industry, secret financing of parties, and corruption of officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010,” he emphasizes, “the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars on the contracts,” because some of them have swallowed their instinct to retain their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already caught two mayor," he adds, hoping that it will succeed in "to show the tactics behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The 2011 established, permanent anti-corruption unit is also making great efforts with its troops to accountants, investigators and government analysts.
Moreover, the police of the “Marteau Group”, which has since 2009 made the “Canalization Cartel” of Montreal appear more consistent with the artificial blurry of the contracts.
In recent weeks, she has conducted numerous house investigations and raised accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal mandates such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, the third-largest city of Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving smoke money in exchange for public contracts.
Explicitly accused were engineers at the road building office of Montreal, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter inspired the Commission by declaring the functioning of the “system” for receiving public procurement.
For several years, he himself has paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a mafia-related mediator who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito had his hand in the game throughout the 2000s by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were then in power.
He also claimed to have organized an illegal fundraising for former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Canalization contracts whose costs were artificially charged by him
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked smoothly.
Former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant detailed this before the Commission: in ten years, he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as deposits of $736,000 in compensation for canalization contracts, the costs of which he artificially flourished.
Other officials of the road building office have admitted that they made themselves shy by artificially blinding the invoices with false supplementary services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget that filled his wallets with black money.
As a result of these disclosures, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, leading Montreal to a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal MPs to hit the alarm.
As a mayor of the city district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she refused from 2010 against the sale of a municipal foundation that was purchased for $5 million and sold for $1.6 million to builders in the growing real estate market.
70% black money in election campaigns
From the investigation, which is ultimately carried out, she says that it "tracks on a fade that allows it to understand the functioning of the system migrated by the monkeys to stop the evil and raise the guilty."
She says that the procedure is “doling but positive.”
We are trying to clean the wound, but we needed an investigation unit only for Montreal, as well as a supervision to prevent a return of controversial practices.
How to clean.
Regularly .
Jacques Duchesneau, on his side, notes that “officiers have stolen several hundred million dollars,” but he is primarily thinking about the role of the “mandaters who are over the tactics in the picture” if they were not involved in the fraud!
Based on a share of 70% of black money in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he laughs: "I was told that this is just a weak breakdown of reality."
Quebec’s government proposes to limit the donations to the parties to $100, which he says nothing would change the situation: “As long as the campaign spending is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics.”
He recommends a complete review of the system for the provision of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by going the things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau calls on those who laugh at it to take a look at their own backyard.
PSG is not the FC Barcelona.
In this season, you have taken a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
I progress on their side every day.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level of play every day.
And with a game, it is even easier.
In football everything goes very fast.
But I don’t break out in enthusiasm.
Since I started in the center of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my time at Saint-Etienne, I have progressed gradually.
They take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti.
The new arrivals this summer are used to perform games of very high levels.
You also know that every training unit is crucial.
This leads to a player like me, who has to offer the face and wants to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my game position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
of course.
Ancelotti gives respect to all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious associations.
He had contact with great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January I had an encouraging conversation with him.
I just recovered from a series of injuries.
The confidence he has put in me is also an explanation for my performance.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the place of the top rider.
But we run in the back.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: in this way we qualified for the eighth final.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on everything is possible.
However, we will have to speak against very good European teams.
First, we want to be the first in our group before Porto, so that we can play the back game of the eighth final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a big European association in the short term?
He has the budget for this...
To become a big European association, Paris has to win titles and make a name in the long run.
This is not the case today.
Finally, the PSG gives itself the funds for this project to take concrete forms.
Would it be a big failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as it was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year, we are really happy to take this title.
In the last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed as we were strong enough to win there.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
You should be a master with 79 points.
But another team, the Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right thing.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux run around the title, I think we have the thing to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that a lot is expected from us.
We fully accept that.
However, if we win 4-0 against Troyes in a home game, and you still find something you can accuse us, it’s somewhat frustrating.
You wonder what people expect.
We could never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not the FC Barcelona.
We are trying to create a game concept.
A team is building up with time.
In the Champions League we showed strength.
Consider Manchester City, a team that has not been able to qualify for the eighth final for two seasons and has also made huge spending!
With regard to the invested amounts, you were believed to have a break with 15 points advance!
This would say that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good in the last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winners and tell us that we’ve finally won them despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s performance.
To be so better that one is talking about a “zlatan dependence”.
That means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many doors.
That's why he came and he proves that he's the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he has played, he has made it clear that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, allows everyone else to make progress as well.
How did you experience the 2012 World Cup with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
I was happy to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from spending some game time out.
I have seen things from which I came strongly.
Today I can play good games in the national team.
This was my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have drawn our lessons, and today we have to demonstrate a model behavior.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, stands close to the players and calls for victory.
As was Laurent Blanc.
I do not want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is the uncertainty (1:1) forced on October 16 in Spain a starting game?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone has served for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the stakeholders.
Furthermore, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is encounterable: the belief that the current monetary system, formed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but can be converted into dollars, euros, etc.) as well as a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, approximately 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or a means of payment.
After the rate of Bitcoin in June 2011 reached a maximum of $30 (23 euros), it fell to $2 five months later, before it has recovered to around $10 today (the rates are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as “the virtual currency with the greatest success”, “in competition with the dollar or the euro” and “like the traditional currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the “credits” that are used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy through games (and sometimes also exchange).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, the trade is controlled and processed by a central authority every time.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are at the same time account holder, auditor, money mediator, as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data related to this transaction is signed electronically through a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the entire network-wide account of public accounts.
The crucial step is to incorporate this new transaction into this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that starts on the computers, with the winner, which is a kind of preliminary central bankier, having the privilege to add these additional lines.
It is a file decomposition, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unified electronic fingerprint.
The computers “accept” the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole is “destroyed”.
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many nules at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is right.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If one user wants to pay for fraud twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other remains unconnected, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that has solved the task receives 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
Bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be shared up to a hundred million points, which leaves a certain spark.
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with any improvement in the computing performance.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits were stolen.
“The weakness used does not affect the actual protocol,” assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for paying with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also indicates this deficiency.
Important actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
By others such as the blog platform WordPress they are accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the bill and showed that 80% of Bitcoin is not in circulation.
In November, a “Mega End Sales” was launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, the company that turns bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions that are thus cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented with the traders, and the latter does not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to specify an address that can be “photographed and recognized” by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend to be observed in which hierarchical systems are overthinked in favour of stronger horizontal-oriented systems.
“It will take some time to get Bitcoin down, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
By the way, the ECB proposes in its report to re-evaluate the various risks that are now considered to be high in the event of a success of this currency.
We are withdrawn from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their responsibility areas in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan Army to recover the possession of its territory, and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we have punished Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the wounded and deceased.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, like the Soviet times.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Usbek and Tajik have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by the local rebels, the latter will no longer be there when the western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, which was funded using French loans, took place properly.
The truck and tank convoys overflowed by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
At the end of 2014, there will be no more flooding of the Taliban in Kabul.
Since its unresistible move from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was overwhelmed by the war due to the struggles of the various offshore groups.
Their assumption of power was then seen as a form of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obskurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved until today.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into business makers by capturing government land to sell them as a building country to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefit from the massive U.S. granting subcontracts.
They have brought themselves into appeal, and most of them were not involved in the struggles themselves.
As I heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, like those who could benefit from the U.S. grants: the capital escape is considerable.
The young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.
During their exile to Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have their benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obskurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; the television with its Turkish series that represent a modern world is watched everywhere.
There is an army now.
Will the authorities under which it will be commanded be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle already to restore the militia in the province, which will escape from the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of mountains with strong local identities, would have benefited from a certain decentralization on the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the post of Prime Minister, which existed since the Constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make it a centralized state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, its country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been reconstructed, functional dust plants are not available and important hydration systems have not been repaid.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a country undergoing 30 years of war, a state control of the infrastructure would have been required.
The rumors were spread that Afghanistan possesses enormous land treasures.
This further boosts the impression that the Western countries were only on the site to understand it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper hand on the site, or without means of transport for export over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mines of Mes Aynak, allow international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to make their excavations on the enormous Buddhist site and remain the main employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which imports and exports are largely dependent, rebuild normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French troops was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls and youth gymnasies, Institute of French at the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was stopped in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit works and measures for the restoration of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organization to try to "win the hearts and spirits" and to the impossible task of the harmonization of aid and offensive actions.
These work, for which numerous local workers were needed, could have helped suppress the rebellion: irrigation, fountains, drinking water, rebuilding, fruit trees, soil protection and increasing agricultural benefits.
What souvenir do we leave back after military spending of 2 billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions that are very hard in these valleys often at a height of more than 2000 meters.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to get rid of the rebellion led by foreign groups, which, according to their own statements, is their desire, the continuation of smaller, well-controlled and directly related civil aid would be necessary in their favor.
The breach of the constitution in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains more than ever divided with regard to the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily gives it the unlimited power, he has decided to put everything on a map.
To surprise everyone, he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutional Assembly will approve its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given this plenary two additional months for the completion of his work.
Egypt has now relyed on a preliminary, multi-modified text for almost two years, which weakens institutional stability and leads to a legal confusion.
This new initiative only provided for an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the president holds in his “autocratic delirium” by continuing to “break his word” and “the right goes with his feet.”
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period that forces the brothers to give up their plans to explain to the Egyptians the text section for section.
For the president, it is also a way to recover his public and democratic legitimacy while the protests rise throughout the country.
After confirmations in an interview with the American Weekly Time, Mohammed Mursi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote benevolently.
Especially as the Egyptian people are given an ultimatum with this withdrawal to an agreed vote: “Of you vote for my draft or I retain the unlimited authority,” the latter is supposed to take an end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 majority of the Islamist members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals did not meet the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in the middle of November, they declined because they believe they were unable to put their views into force.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to the decision-making capacity, 11 members, deputy members, were added tomorrow morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly approved unanimously.
By the way, the commentators found it fun that the only discrepancy of the day ... was expressed at the time for prayer, as some members of the board believed that the hour of the constitutional assembly did not go exactly.
The text, which has been adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all attention, ultimately remains identical to that of the Constitution of 1971 and states that “the principles of sharia are the main source of law.”
The salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope to replace the "principles" with the "rules", which would have made a more strict application possible.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a proof of their good will and their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
“Scientificity” is responded by the liberals, who see it only as a propaganda blow.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
In particular, they have regard to Article 220, which acknowledges the University of Al-Azhar as a advisory function, in particular with regard to the review of compliance with the laws of the Sharia.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because “the people who are asked for a statement have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of theocracy.”
The fears of the liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university is much less modest than the present.
"There is no specific religious engagement to be recognized.
With this Constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
The majority of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who are partly trained in the French system,” says Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral paper on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, he acknowledges, “that there may be a pluralism with regard to Article 220, as the terms used are derived from the religious vocabulary.
It is referred to the “fiqh” [Islamic jurisprudence, Anm. d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to how competent civil judges are to decide about it.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticized due to the extensive powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the desire of the military, the review of the defence budget is not submitted to the Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Likewise, there will be no prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, as the human rights defence associations have demanded.
The latter also share their fears regarding the text they view as a threat to freedom.
The fact of blasphemy will beined, and offenses are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article is more related to the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect holy places, the noble of the world and a sea from the sun
The promised land combines the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and untouched nature.
AIF tells you the five main reasons to visit Israel.
Above the Holy Places
Visit the river Jordan, where Jesus was buried.
It is said that everyone who swim in this river receives God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his wonders: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding party, the walking on the water, the breastfeeding of the sea tower and the fishing.
This is where Jesus appeared to His disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the churches are located in Jerusalem.
Believers walk here the path of suffering or the cross path of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The journey begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretoria, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the Old Town to the tomb church on the mountain of Golgotha, where the crucifixion, the salmon and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, according to Christian conception, is the nobility of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree grows from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most holy place of the Jews - the Klagemauer, the remains of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 BC.
Traditionally, people of different religions leave there lists of wishes, which then go into fulfillment.
Take a trip to the height
The ruins of the Fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hiding from enemies that Herod the Great built for his family in the year 25 BC.
They are located on a rocky wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins by their own strength.
Everyone else brings an air railway to this historic summit.
In the north of the country in 1600 to 2040 meters of height is the famous ski area of Hermon, which attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you get there with a shuttlebus.
The skies have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, allegedly pagan gods lived on the mountain summit.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
With only one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be given a visit.
The museum is located near the Knesset (Parliament).
There are preserved ancient Qumran manuscripts or scripts from the Dead Sea, found in rocky hills in the Jewish desert, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibitions.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There is the collection of works of the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several pillars of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures of the then visitors and bathers.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are neither museum guides nor souvenirs stores.
Entrance is free and donations are essentially rejected.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells about one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most captivating department is the children's monument, built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room, there is complete darkness.
The stars shine.
The names of the children of the Jews and the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three main rescue areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinaries and oceanaries.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is swallowed in the winter months as the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air is heated to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and it is flooded throughout the year.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thus carries even non-sweaters easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is undescribedly beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt) and healing slurry as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and for the calming of strapasiated nerves.
The Secrets of Ancient Age
These secrets cover the old town of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city passed the famous sea, which connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to the surrender, Noah built his ark just here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists enjoy sliding through the narrow streets named by star signs.
Fortuna is to be the legend according to all who touch the walls in the street with their star sign.
In Jaffa, you can encounter newly married couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo termins.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman Theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusader.
In the Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judah and the residence of the Roman rulers, including Pontius Pilate.
In the carefully restored theater, evening concerts and operas are presented today.
Merklist for tourists
When you’re traveling to Israel, don’t worry about your poor English skills: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money on the trip is preferable not to be taken in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be exchanged in shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you get mostly by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway and in Haifa the only subway line of the country with six stations that connects the suburb with the capital.
It is precisely a subterranean station.
A ride within the city costs no matter the means of transportation 6 shekels, which is sufficient including climbing for a ride of up to 1.5 hours.
According to the Jewish tradition, the sabbath is celebrated in Israel.
From Friday evening to Saturday sunset, markets and shops are closed, and public transportation is resting.
On Sunday morning the working week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and hostels, only cocker food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish-free, and foods that contain both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you will have the choice between various dishes with hammer and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus pasta, various sauces, fried bowls of peered beans and herbs (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no streaming dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this, there are many well-fooded cats that strike through the streets comfortably and unbeatfully.
In the evening, you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
Cats like living places and don’t say no to tastes.
A car rental costs between $37 a day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs $15 a day.
And a bicycle rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Entrance tickets for museums cost at an average of 30 shekels.
in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists arrived in the promised country, which is a 51% increase compared to the comparison period in 2010, before the visa obligation was cancelled on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" Leads to Moscow: Migrants Save Money for Language
While parliamentarians and lawmakers discuss the benefits of the law on binding speech tests for migrants, criminals already deal with false certificates.
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money for the maintenance of the families residing in the home.
On December 1st, a law came into force that requires every working migrant to submit a test that proves knowledge of the Russian language.
Until now, this regulation applies only to migrants who wish to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing and in the retail sector.
However, the tests will be mandatory for all guest workers in the future, according to the Federal Migration Authority.
It is necessary not only to test language, but also to test the Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both obtaining and extending the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian is the official language.
Also excluded from this law are persons who received their qualifications and diplomas before the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, problem and protection of rights
The entire examination bodies will be under the edge of the Pushkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of International Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the tests in all cities; more than 160 corresponding centers have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
On the other hand, before the law came into force, civil lawmakers have repeatedly asked the following question in the press: What does this bring?
What changes does the rule bring about the need to show language skills, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
First of all, the spokesman of the Migration Authority opposes, it is about reducing the number of forced workers.
"Many now talk about the protection of the rights of workers migrants," said head of the representation of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, your rights must be protected before you leave.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants are faced with problems without work, education, language skills and medical examination.
Sebelew is convinced that a future immigrant without language knowledge will necessarily encounter people with evil intentions, which will put him under the pretext of help in a dark, narrow bar, where he will spend dozens of his same months without food and documents and will make 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
“In the home you will be promised the one, and at arrival you will be deceived, their passes will be withdrawn and the promised salary will not be received,” confirms Tolib Schwaripow, head of the head of the workmigration department of the Tadjikistan Migration Authority.
Don’t be foolish boss.
However, many citizens of the Central Asian Republics, who want to make their money in Russia, admit that they don’t only master the language of the destination, but they hardly can express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not their fault as much as the evil: only a few Turkmen, Usbek and Tadjik can afford a reasonable primary education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, but to buy them decent clothes, shoes, and school stuff.
As a teenager, these children immediately take the first chance to earn money.
“It’s hard without language knowledge,” they admit.
“You feel humiliated and inferior.”
Civil rights officials emphasize the following important aspect regarding the law.
The test must be carried out only by migrants with legal status.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the host workers continue to stay illegal in Russia.
“Heartly welcome” or “access for unauthorized people is prohibited”
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status in Russia.
The reason is the bureaucratic obstacles and, of course, the language difficulties.
Moreover, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A false registration can be done quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and then there are cases of persecution.
“They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea,” Tadjikistan leader Umed Huschkadamov told reporters.
Don’t be afraid of false papers.
On the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants could be false.
Some false certificates that confirm the completion of the language test have already been captured by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with a regular color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get these for free: Every immigrant hoping to save the tests so paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a working migrant three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot be easily purchased, both officials and civil lawmakers agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time that they will get time for a language basic course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered jobs in areas where no active understanding with people is required.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs ignores illegal weapons market
The proportion of legal weapons in crimes is extremely low.
The Russian Ministry of the Interior plans to strengthen the weapons law for private weapons owners.
Thus, the authorities are responding to the recent events: injured in shootings at wedding and seven dead in the shooting of Moscow lawyer Dmitry Winogradov.
Police want to ban the use of non-death weapons in the public and increase the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the chairman of the Duma Security and Anti-Corruption Committee, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act will be submitted soon to the Duma.
Not everyone is pleased that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "attracting the scraps".
On the Internet, an open letter was published whose authors – representatives of various weapons associations – call on the authorities to take away from “sensitive exacerbations”.
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, the criminal lawmaker, Wasilij Lesnikov, told the BBC's Russian service.
According to the Ministry of the Interior statistics, 142 crimes with the use of registered weapons were committed over the course of six months in 2012, while for the same period a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that an aggravation of the law for private weapons owners will not prevent criminals from serving themselves on the black market.
Nowadays, according to the authors, any possible weapon can be found in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior emphasizes that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: From Factory to Officers
The weapons reach the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who has been working for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts weapons orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the battles in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by both Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves,” Baranez said.
On the second channel, illegal weapons are coming, the orders are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that these include weapons stolen from both the police’s weapons chambers and directly by the staff of the prosecutor’s authorities.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military arms warehouses.
In many military camps there were many explosions.
"There are evidence that in some cases it was a firewall to hide the lack of weapons," the former military official said.
According to Baranez, weapons manufacturers are also contributing to the black market.
“Today, there are countless private weapons factories that don’t stand the international competition and that’s why weapons are in the hand on the black market, such as Moscow,” the expert.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggle.
A lot of weapons and weapons come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
“There’s a own, sometimes artificial production, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggle,” the former military official explains.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts calculated what share each of the five channels has in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons approximately.
In 2011 a report was written by the Center for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on weapons portals.
The majority of the illegal weapons are from the army and the law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market are there because of the “cause of the responsible who have come to deal with weapons in their work,” the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from conflict areas, 14% go back to theft in weapons production, and 5% come from illegal extraction.
A sales consultant of a weapon load, which does not want to be named, assures that weapons that are found in illegal excavations have long been no longer bought because they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common that traders get the push in a weapons warehouse.
A gun, for example a gun of the type TT, is purchased through a fence.
The weapon is issued and delivered through the gardens.
“The merchant brings the weapon to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines,” he said.
“The police, of course, know everything and therefore, if they can’t follow the crime detection plan, periodically conduct control purchases from traders offering illegal weapons,” the sales adviser added.
“As in the luxury store”
Buyers and sellers find each other most commonly about acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone was noticed to me and suggested to come to the "Begowaja" station where a person would wait for me, bringing me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
I did not know the price of the weapon.

"To get a weapon, I need a acquaintance who has contacts," says the sales adviser. "I have such a acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are traders on the markets, but there you have to go and meet with a code like "of Ivan Ivanovich, who makes it clear that the daughter has lost a tooth."
I am currently even getting to some strikes about a friend I trust.
He also gives me the strings only because he knows that I don’t cheat him.
Newers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on this topic.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He received a photo album in which "all possible" was depicted.
“I felt like in the luxury store,” the military member remembers.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the pocket, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I’m not just buying, but riding with the seller into the forest, and there we put on a target board.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we will negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
There will not be any documents required or there will be personal meetings.
“You only need the appropriate amount of money,” it says in the advertisement on the website “buy combat pistols or weapons.”
There users make your orders and make requests.
Are they also sold to minors?
“Naturally without a license,” users ask “Iwan” (verbal quotation).
“Buy a TT. Moscow,” says the laconic question of “Fedorenkow”.
The Federal Security Service recently shut down countless screenshots, and buyers who want to buy weapons go to the service.
The people come like hungry fish to feed and then land in Siberia and get to swallow coal.
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The administrators accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money through a banking machine.
"As a response, he will receive a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," said Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie".
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that, in the end, you can go out empty and come behind the gitters when placing a query on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently shut down countless screenshots, and buyers who want to buy weapons go to the service.
“People come like hungry fish to feed and then land in the Siberian labor camp and get to swallow coal,” he says.
A Makarow for $100
According to experts, the purchase of illegal weapons is expected at a price of $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie", you can buy a gun of the type Makarov for $100 to $300.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapons are issued in military arms camps by observers of the middle rang.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the number of crimes with illegal weapons in all of Russia in the period from January to October 2011 dropped by 7% to 22.9 thousand, while the number of cases of theft and persecution related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive equipment dropped by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers strike in the US
Each fourth American teenager is sitting behind the McDonald's box at some point.
In recent days there have been massive protests across the US against low wages in Walmart shops and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can even predict whether the protests will continue or whether the air will come out again soon.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast food workers, the organizers of the protests are pursuing the goal of establishing trade unions.
Until now, this industry of the economy is hardly organized by trade unions.
46 cents per year.
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the U.S. which attracted millions of customers, sometimes leading to handmade.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, placed their jobs and struggled together with trade unions and left-wing activists branch chains targeted by low and medium-income people.
Walmart sells all the products, from winds to hunting weapons and car batteries to dusts, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart shops are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
This is why many of the low-paid Walmart employees only buy in their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods only because employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complains about severe working conditions, such as missing rubber tables or hand scanners.
The participants in the Black Friday protests demanded salary increases and expressed their concerns about the contribution to the operational health insurance increased from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 per hour cannot afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California in Berkeley prove that if the company raises the average wage to $12 per hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That is about 1.1% more than you donate for salary now.
If Walmart would completely transfer wages to customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
This would be $12.39 per year for them compared to today.
Walmart’s supporters are pleased to note that there were protests in nine states and that they did not protect the company for any losses.
The Black Friday lasted in its store from 8 a.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that period Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart casinos made 100 million transactions on the Black Friday.
The company’s spokesman, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post that a total of “less than five” Walmart employees placed the work and the protest was just “an additional PR trick” of the trade union that organized the protests.
“Free cash!”
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target was not Walmart shops (which are not desirable in this advanced city and therefore not existing so far), but McDonald's and other affordable restaurants.
McDonald’s says the company sells billions of portions, and yet you don’t get sick days, and you won’t be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage according to federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually increased, but not too strong, and on average, their simple employees in New York get $8.90 per hour.
Less than they deserve no one in this expensive city.
How it is possible to get out in New York with so little money is uncomprehensible for me.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. youths after school stood behind the theke at McDonald's, but the youths still lived with their parents.
Almost no one saw the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald’s employees, I am constantly met with people who complain that they get out of that salary and sometimes even have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you don’t know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which began Thursday at 6:30 a.m. in front of the McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashers and chefs of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 per hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
The U.S. law prohibits corporate governments from standing on the path of this goal and dismissing or dismissing trade union members.
On the other hand, the corporate management does not make it easy to them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high fluctuation of staff.
Unhappy
Strong protests took place on that day in front of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting in the afternoon in front of the McDonald's at the Times Square, where some local Democrats, including Mayor Jumaane Williams, spoke: "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you don't get sick days, and you won't be paid for your honest work!"
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayor candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support fast food employees so that they can get a fair salary and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!".
According to the New York Times, this was the biggest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on the site, of whom not all are employed in the fast food industry, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is still unlikely that the fountain of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
“The brain can only be overlisted moderately.”
The popular topic of advanced reality among the supporters of modern technologies is recently perceived as usual by the lens of a special glass.
For the first time, Google presented a functioning model in its annual conference in the summer, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also registered a patent.
However, in conversation with the head of the interactive 3D technology group at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, it is clear that the glasses for the company’s scientists were just a passage station.
It excites the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with simple hands and create virtual free spots.
Please briefly describe which research your group is conducting.
We are engaged in the interaction of man and machine, but we want to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
Until now, mankind has mostly remained in the phase in which pixels work on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to predict 5-10 years and predict the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a progress, and today the Xbox is no longer sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
What else awaits us in the future?
Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, many things still happen on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet been crucial.
We try to change this, working on real three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We must release the computer world into our physical world and make it more fassable.
But for this, it is necessary that not only the user, but also his surroundings are recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much easier with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these humiliated virtual reality helm!
What do you think about language control?
She is popular, but is not overestimated?
- It is not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because you don't always want to inform everyone about your actions and intentions.
In fact, any type of interaction with computers is good, but each in its particular niche.
For example, we worked in the field of the control of objects on public spaces on a project in which we experimented with short and short, rather than with exhausting gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a armband that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but theoretically it could be reduced to the size of an armband clock.
But overall, the future, however, belongs to mixed types of control, such as gesture and language.
How is that?
Would we ask you, for example, to give you this scratch?
They say it and explain it at the same time.
Normally I just say it.
Oh, that would be very difficult to recognize.
Do you want the user to adapt to what a machine can do at the time and what not?
Not necessarily, but it is a mutual approach.
I think we will need to work on the development of new sensory types in the near future, which will enable us to capture people’s reactions more accurately.
This can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What demands do you put from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors to modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or anything else?
The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
Thus, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It needs to be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and the number of images per second are also important.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and openly said, the current 30 fps are too little especially for gestures.
In our laboratory in Redmond, Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor with a regulable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today’s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work I needed exactly such a device, just without touch control and with more images per second.
Should the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cams", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a usual RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras could solve the problem.
Or aggravate the problem as more calculations would be needed.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different cameras to find out how this helps us in the three-dimensional detection of a position.
- If I remember right, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public, unlike Google.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of advanced reality in everyday life the glasses have the best prospects?
Of course, it’s not pleasant to always keep a smartphone in the upward hand on the way, but I think that the greatest option would be a “changing” expanded reality in which we could switch from the glasses to the smartphone through a cloud.
The glasses are a personal gadget and in it lies their strength (private things can only be seen by you), but at the same time their weakness, because an advanced reality through the glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that the critics of this idea often point to: There is no sensible reaction!
The hands do not feel anything.
What answers will your group give to this question?
In my lectures I often speak of the fact that the expanded reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could be the integration of tactical perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a slightly unusual projection document.
She perceives the pressure excellently.
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the “images in the air” a bit of handfitting, for example, the interference of some direct ultrasound rays at a certain point where the finger is located generates a feeling that is at the moment but still as weak as someone dropped over the handballs.
There are also bands for the joint that affect the nerves in the fingers, also that is a potential direction.
Have you tried to overlist your brain?
Does it think that it feels what it should feel when it just sees something?
This is a good idea, so we haven’t tried it yet.
Here is another task that we will have to fight for a long time, namely to let a person physically in a closed room believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we work on concepts with running bands (other than in gyms), moving platforms, and big balls.
Until now, the brain can only be overlisted moderately, and there are still many working years ahead of us.
That’s what makes the work on virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: in many topics we’re just at the beginning.
Your own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the “Petersburg Avantgarde” project dedicated to the city residents who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the elected list already landed high-ranking representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the city’s borders and often find recognition in Europe, without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the red-wrapped barrier, who is met at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at the stage meetings, or at the vernissages.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are displayed, they attract large masses of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical St. Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant personality of the St. Petersburg Avantgarde in the late 80s and early 90s.
He is also a man of the city, and by his presence on the street he feels a smile in the face of his fellow citizens and gives them a good mood.
Recently, he took a scroll and became a St. Petersburg scroll player as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you actually always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer who deals with optics and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, everything that differs from the green norm causes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to the people through my provocations.
Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to talk.
When did you know you have to be a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Cultural Palace of Newskij, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painters ended, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I fell friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of "Gazonewschina"; from that "Puschkinskaja 10" was created, and then it was first ended.
It attracts me to theater, to fashion, to music, to everything except literature.
It was important for me to be at the heart of the Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995, I occupied a room in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemian, the House of the Petersburg Bohemian, until the renovation works.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how the thread with his project "Ucho Van Goga" came there.
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs for play-back, wearing narrow tricks, and among them was today’s famous composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group began to play live, it became from her "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but the foundations he learned from us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have its origin in the Art Clinic.
There were our staff and guests.
I am a hero of the past century, when culture was still something meaningful.
In 2000 there was a press survey that discussed the award "People of our City".
I won in the "Artists of the Year" category, and so I was at the peak.
It’s not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I’m a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
Your work has an unprecedented style.
Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the actuality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
Previously I was social, but now it hurt and prepares fear to be so.
In a clown, it loses everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, we save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone looks at the clothes and is oriented to the outside and not to the inside of man.
But you may not be allowed to give a man the hand, but you should swallow it into his face.
The deception disappears by clothing.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the city filmmaker. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
Who if not I?
Can commercial art be beautiful?
Today, commercial art must be cautious, cautious and smooth.
We see the collapse of cultures.
Previously, the people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved one and the simple people the other.
Now there are microcommunities, and it’s hard to like everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you will like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
There are thousands of Stas Mikhailov’s performances.
- To him come abandoned women, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, therefore there is less management, money, and everything goes under.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not to destroy what is achieved.
In my youth, I painted such pictures that were attached to a collector even in a series with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that usually come only at the end of my career.
There are often misunderstandings today.
It means: intellectual culture and consumption culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that’s something completely different.
I am a person of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture I support.
What is missing in Petersburg?
Good cultural experts.
It is said to be a servant of culture.
But not everyone can deal with culture.
In the real Zars, it was different, because the Zars may not understand a lot of culture, but they realized that the right experts are needed.
There are good consultants in Moscow.
In St. Petersburg, we have those who might be experts, but they are blocked the way because they need higher-level experts to correctly evaluate the first ones and give them the way.
Now it’s just your own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, however, with the difference that they honestly say they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
What is Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding feedground.
On our stones, art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural foundation because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that’s not right.
In Europe there are many curious people visiting exhibitions or concerts.
It is much less for us.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by the city of St. Petersburg.
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Earth warming or collision with killerasteroids.
Karavans of spacecrafts with Earth inhabitants on board are searching for a replacement planet.
To save mankind, the important question is, how can we grow up in gravity or on the replacement planet?
I do not think there are many options.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically be inhabited.
“Name Mars and Venus,” says the scientist of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute, Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are relatively life-friendly, a temperature of 500 degrees runs on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be possible at great height or in the circle of Venus, i.e. in all.
The question of reproduction in general, the researchers first addressed in terms of flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were conducted with plants.
The fourth generation of hereditary crops in the orbit does not differ at least from the Earth species.
It followed the cultivation of insects, more precisely of small fruit flows (drosophila), in the orbit.
In 1979, wachtlears were sent to space to explore how gravity affects the development of embryos.
It develops a normal cake.
But then the problem begins.
“The problem is that the cake must find a stop; it must be able to stand on his legs and start moving,” explains laboratory leader of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without a solid ground, the cows swallowed wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborn disappeared completely.
The cows did not respond to light and light.
Four days later they just died.
"Two times we laid cows hunt and then put it all in, because it's simply impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychew says on the failed experiment with the cows in all.
The last cage with animals flew into the orbit 16 years ago.
The experiment will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, only homogeneous species will be found on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized sent to the whole.
In principle, nothing special was not observed.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," said Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the spacecraft received newborns.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are thrown out of their natural habitat can simply not follow their reproductive effort.
Unlike animals, man can do so.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
From ethical considerations, such experiments are not performed.
But women have been flying in all for 50 years.
The biggest risk was at Tereschkowa.
The most valuable thing that mankind possesses is the female organism.
Our mouse flew from it, and no one on Earth would have been able to answer the following question: Is it over the space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
“Finally, no one answered this question,” says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after their space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkowa, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrijan Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in all, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was on orbit twice and even worked outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
However, there remains a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts, with whom after long flights everything went well and they got healthy teens.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even when flights in the orbit," concludes cosmonaut Waleri Poljakov, the hero of the Soviet Union and the hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, mankind has to look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the production of artificial gravity.
The hydrolabor in the preparation center of the cosmonauts is a mandatory station during the flight preparation.
Here, in a fluid state, the cosmonauts gain routine for work in the open space.
The water represents gravity.
Even if adults feel water as pleasant, it is a strange environment; but babies feel water as a natural element.
It’s as if the little Ichtyander witnessed that life on the ground went down to the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a baby is in the stomach of the mother for about 9 months in fruit water, and that it can then more easily get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, as from birth to the first swimming just 2 weeks pass.
“This is too little time to forget something,” says babyswim teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child, thus, gravity is a much more natural state, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of gravity, the abdominal and bacterial muscles are formed very quickly and thus the ability to suppress the child decreases.
Well, we get around this by means of birth guidance.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special room to push the child out.
“But what’s happening then?” is Waleri Poljakov’s not unimportant question.
The child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earthquake, the body cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be placed in an orbit as an adult for training.
He will simply lack what is of elementary importance for his life.
“This experiment we’re doing together, namely the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead us to bring a disabled, a completely inappropriate person to birth,” said Igor Pestow, head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems RAN.
Until now, the birth of children in space is merely a theory.
But at some point it will become a reality when the Earth’s inhabitants in their spacecraft break up to a distant planet that will become the home to their all-born descendants.
NKÚ head: control of the Black system fails due to policy misconduct
In the context of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws, but falls down in their application.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, this said the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
“A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly – and this is not my opinion for us,” Kala commented on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a joint control by Czech and German examiners.
As a negative example of practice, he follows the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "black system".
Recently, the prime minister said that the ODS would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now prohibited or permitted?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot easily come to the president of the government, and the control office, whose duty now is to control compliance with the law, can interfere with its activities," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee of the House of Representatives, you talked about a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries regarding public procurement were compared with each other.
What was it concrete?
This is a parallel examination that we started about two years ago.
In short, it is about the European legislation to determine how public contracts are to be handled. on this the national legislation builds up. and finally there is still the actual practical application.
All of this we have compared with each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have been able to notice extremely interesting differences. in general, the laws with us may even be a little "stricker and more perfect", but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to set up new and more accurate rules, but it is also necessary to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can this project help you? what does this project result for you?
It is precisely such a joint control that could help us stop continuously striving to improve the laws and to lower and obsolete thresholds, if this obviously does not have a positive effect.
Economicity means buying a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of the threshold for orders does not guarantee that we will also this goal.
Per it’s even that we load the system in this way only with excessive “papers” and those who are looking for gap in the system have it significantly easier to exploit the system than when the thresholds remain higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech contracting law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As regards the authorities, the German pendant to the NKÚ of the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similarly built as with us and also has a college that is only formed a little differently.
The competences are also to a certain extent comparable, but Germany is a federal state, that is, that there are these accounts also in the individual federal countries - in that the German system is different from our.
The BRH may only control federal funds what corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by the districts and municipalities, are there subject to the control of the state accounting heads.
Is the German law easier than our law?
However, Germany is often referred to as an example in a certain sense, but it is not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Is it because the examiners are better?
That’s not certain, but as I said, I don’t like such comparisons.
It is also important to note that the countries that are an example for us are also facing problems.
Otherwise they’t have anything to do with our authority, right?
With regard to the Czech legislation, what importance had for your authority the novelization of the contract law, do you already feel any effects?
Given the fact that this novel is only in force for a short time, it does not work on our tests so far.
Since our controls take place subsequently, we have to expect some delay here.
Effects we have seen so far more in the preparation phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Recognition of the risks of disadvantage" and with this 14,000 public contracts have been reviewed and analyzed - here the changes will naturally impact, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tender have been modified, etc.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or is the system loaded with further bureaucracy?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become “stricter” and can no longer be observed.
Under the previous rules, the persons undergoing an examination shall be liable to the holder (for example, in the case of an operational program of regional policy, the regional council) to the point that any non-compliance with the contract law is equivalent to a violation of the budgetary discipline.
Is it reasonable to make the law stricter?
In my opinion not in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect the actual decision making.
Such a system only puts the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the exit?
First, let’s say which path is not targeting.
The prime minister said recently that the ODS would not accommodate entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black-system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system prohibited or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the president of the government cannot easily come, and the control office, whose duty now is to control compliance with the law, can interfere with its activities.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he can't say that we do as if nothing would be.
The contract law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions – and this is also appropriate for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic when the provider with the best offer is excluded only due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be properly applied – and that’s what we think is missing.
The streets are isolated glaciers, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there are some snow and ice stores.
Mostly, however, the roads are well accessible, sometimes increased caution is required.
by Karlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad the streets were well accessible this morning, isolated ruling snow and ice.
The temperatures fall to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should be a little warmer.
There is no longer snow in the region, and in the deeper heights there is only a thin snow cover.
However, on the roofs of the Erzgebirge there are about 30 cm of snow.
According to the district street guard, the view was restricted due to clouds.
The R6 Highway and the first-class road roads in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is given, for example, to bridges on which the trains are sometimes required and smooth.
All roads of the second and third class, including the mountain roads, are also accessible.
However, on these roads remains sectionally required or out-of-the-country snowstones.
Especially in the higher locations, therefore, greater attention is required.
District of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some streets in East Bohemia there is a danger due to glaciation, in higher lags and in the mountains there is sometimes a snow layer on the streets, the road and highway direction reports on its websites.
The road championship warns drivers of the ice fields, which may occur especially in higher fields in the Pardubice district.
This is possible on the second and third-class road roads in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The streets I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické Hory Mountains.
An experienced snow layer is located in heights on the streets of the circles Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohems today it is mostly sunny or hot, and it remains largely downfall-free.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, there is a weak wind.
District of Pilsen
The streets in the district of Pilsen are well accessible today, but local attention is required, and the way of driving is adapted to the weather.
This is cold in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures then fall, it can come to ice on the streets.
Local is also expected with cloud, but the vision will improve over the course of the day.
This information comes from the district road championships.
The highway D5 is practically unlimited, but high attention is recommended by the road champions between the 80th and the 131st kilometers.
The railways of the first class are mostly dry, but frozen.
However, in the south of the circle of the fungus and Tachov, it may be partially to ice.
The trains of the second and third road classes are wet, and therefore the reference to possible required sections is also applicable here.
Drivers should be especially cautious on the less frequent roads in the Böhmerwald area.
District of Olomouc
With snowfall today, drivers are expected to travel towards the heights in the Olomouc district.
After the use of streak vehicles, Snowmatsch remains on the Pass of Červenohorské sedlo as well as on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Night snorkeling forced the road champions to use, in the district of Šumperk, according to the road administration, about 3 cm new snow fell.
In the rest of the district, the railways are mostly unlimited.
"In the district of Šumperk there is still the snowest in the heights.
On the Červenohorské sedlo pass, drivers have to expect snowfall in the direction of Jeseník,” Šumperk’s road management employee told ČTK today.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník district also had to go out at night, according to their reports, the streets to the heights are free and wet after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are entirely accessible, but in the Šternberk district, drivers have to drive carefully in waters, since here the trains are still wet.
District of Ústí nad Labem, District of Liberec
In North Bohems, the road championships report several poorly transported road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the district of Ústí n.K. is blocked, according to the traffic police.
Temperatures also remain below zero in deeper locations, so snow and ice will remain on the streets. From the deep floors, especially south-east of the Bohemian Middle Mountains, there are no problems, and the streets there are usually dry.
No traffic disturbances have been so far.
This is from the district of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this during the night - during the day rain and melting snow, during the night cloudless sky and cold.
From the main routes as well as from the road I/13 on the border of the districts Ústí n.L. and Liberec, bad traffic conditions are.
The blocking of the road between Telnice and Knínice was required due to the ashes that were pressed from the snow load to the railway.
Shimon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy on our concerts
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
This is one of the catastrophic messages that we people like to address.
With our band The Tap Tap we make ourselves more funny about it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present the project closer to our readers?
This is a national benefit event that we have planned for two years.
To do this, we want to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, the end of which is forecast for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
On the day before, that is, on December 20th, three concerts will be held simultaneously at 21:00 p.m. in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts is about at the time when the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
From whom comes this idea?
Originally well from me, then we presented the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
We do not only want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we will once give this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, pockets and key attachments against the end of the world, with the purchase of which through www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap, along with other performers, has also recorded the so-called Hymne Against the End of the World with the title "The End of the World Falls Out".
Nowadays, the song is very popular on YouTube. will it also appear on the benefit concerts?
Of course, and to the end, provided that everything goes well and the end of the world does not take place...
The song will be singed simultaneously by all performers at all three concerts.
The songs will also be broadcast live from the Czech television.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to cooperation with the two?
We also collaborate with other persons of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many beneficial events and concerts...
We strive to engage these people in our projects.
It has shown that most people are interested in collaborating with us and have fun with it.
What purpose is the profit of the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational center Studeo, where we have been working with the Tap Association in the Jedlička Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly cared for by lecturers who help them in various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we want to help them in this way.
In the framework of the completion of the Jedlička Institute is intended to create a own building, which we will then enter with this project.
There are several groups and performers at each concert.
According to what criteria have you chosen them?
We wanted to create a program that addresses all generations including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý appear.
More information can be found on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar “great events” planned for the future?
In May, we first appear at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
The next year we also want to appear in the Czech House in New York, and I personally – if we’re already in the United States – would like to associate this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your overseas plans are not just small, so far you’ve been in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It’s not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchair needs to be transported in the baggage room. in addition, of course, we need to combine a lot of instrument baggage and other baggage.
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems so far, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that I’ve sometimes somewhat already wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad you have a comparison of how it looks in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with people with disabilities there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than us, we were witnessing in Russia that in the East everything is still in its beginning.
In front of Prague, Moscow is absolutely not hindered. there it is still unusual when someone is on a wheelchair alone in the city center.
It is not even natural that you present a wheelchair driver, for example, in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what direction should we react to the further developed countries?
There are a lot of things that we are hanging behind.
However, it is important to note that any improvement of the situation depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common that even people with severe disabilities can move independently in public spaces, go to museums, use toilets, etc.
But it is not just usual that there a larger group of people with disabilities actively participate in social events, in which we are a little ahead of the band The Tap to the West!
Respect in the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our rows, things will really begin to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of intense personalities.
But if we go back a few years: What motivated you to set up a band in 1998?
At that time I started as a caregiver at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in engaging in something intense.
And since I am a musician and play saxophone, I have joined a music AG with a colleague.
Well, and with the time it is, as our moderator, Láďa Angelovič, to say, treated something out of control (laugh).
The band has been known only in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that collaboration with well-known singers has helped us; in addition, we have also started to actively promote for us.
We have become aware that when something is done and it is not visible from the outside, our own performance in a certain sense does not exist.
Thanks to EU funds, we can also provide good lecturers, high-quality equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to get it so far with the Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that things could be treated differently.
In the show business today, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its way, as everything new is looked at with caution and only after a long time is accepted.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare to claim that Tap Tap belongs to it.
The first impression that the spectator has mostly is of course compassion; that is only of course...
But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full-quality life if they have the necessary resources to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed, this is a progress not only for themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you can’t compromise in many things and you have to demand a certain discipline.
I think this is completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they then find that they have samples twice a week, have to complete preparation phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm in many disappears quickly.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every band who is seriously working and wants to something.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them have been there since the beginning, that is, since 1998?
One is Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. people come and go. that cannot be prevented.
Whoever has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome to us.
The event will take place on the day before the predicted world end, Thursday, December 20, 2012 at 21h.
Places include: Incheba Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three events are finally connected to each other by live-sharing and there is a joint interpretation of the band's "World end falls out" song The Tap Tap.
The goal of the concert is to provide the funds for the equipment of a multifunctional disabled educational center that is intended to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague.
The entrance costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years of age are free, cards are available in advance for bohemic tickets.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of this space authority at a Council of Ministers of the Member States of the European Space Organization ESA. Poland is thus the second member of the former Eastern Block (after the Czech Republic, which became a member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The journey of Poland into space began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish space enthusiasts were engaged in spacecraft, and they did not always get to understand it.
I remember, for example, the lecture by A. Šternfeld of December 6, 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented ideas from his pioneering work "Entry to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the REP-Hirsch Prize in 1934 for "Entry to Cosmonautics" founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky's worldwide recognized contribution to the development of space was honored, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the ground-down side of the moon was named after him.
In 1925 a railway drain was built in Poland, for which a rocket drive was planned.
The author of the draft and the details of this project were unknown.
It is not even clear whether the missile should be used to launch or brake the drainage.
This information comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantery began to deal with missile-driven shots.
The research work was conducted by the Institut Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the submitted documents it is clear that the research had advanced to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, the design of a photoelectric hunting missile emerged in the special press of Ing. Rohoziński, and in the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects concerned the military use of the missile launch.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, its work was terminated from the beginning of the war.
Other articles about space appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Towarzystwo Astronautyczne in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company takes place in 1954 in the November edition of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles are dedicated to spacecraft.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a space company.
At that time there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was to be anticipated that the research of space would have a future.
At its beginning in 1956, the Polish space company PTA sought to join the 1951 established International Federation of Space, and in fact the PTA became a regular member in the autumn of 1956.
In the following year, the first Chairman of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He was in this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been significantly involved in the development of the extremely successful meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and didn’t weigh 5 kg.
Later a improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 the Błędów Desert fleet tests began with the two-level rocket RM-2.
The missile was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to perform real scientific work - the RM-34 missile should reach a airport height of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of height winds.
In 1962, however, the further development was stopped.
The successor of the first rocket of the type RM was the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was designed as a two-stage missile, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of this missile were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differ from each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A missile had a transport space of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B over 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C over 0.62 liters.
The maximum airport height was 37 km for all three types.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 missile was developed at the Aviation Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a 10 kg utility load to a height of about 60 km.
Then the versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning that Poland joined the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which two years later followed the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
In the framework of the Intercosmos program, Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second Intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimir Remek.
The abolition of the law on non-profit work is not a solution.
Last week the Constitutional Court adopted the law on non-profit work.
This decision triggered a vibrant discussion in the public.
It is interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalized world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with impeccable financial speculation.
Due to the great differences in the value of work (wages), there are price tensions.
Under this term is to be understood a state in which the manufacturer tries to persist in economic competition by importing affordable goods by "prohibiting" the competition in order to thus break a greater market share in itself and increase its profits.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their manufacturing abroad or afford to buy there, or to leave their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparatively high labour costs.
Since the private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, the state expenditure necessarily increases.
This situation is further aggravated by the fact that the lords of entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus replace the overall economic and social damage they have caused.
This situation is widely known, so concrete statistics at this point are unnecessary.
The unconscious practice of private capital creates in the individual economies a situation in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, the governments deliver their own population to private capital, regardless of the social consequences.
This is expressed in particular in the amendments to the applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force their own people to accept the dictates of private capital, in particular in the field of wages.
This is done, on the one hand, by economic force in the case of long-term unemployment, and on the other hand by the reduction of workers’ rights.
The result is increasing poverty, as well as increasing differences between poor and rich.
In Germany, there have been public food supplies for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work for a few years.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such a low salary that the state must raise their income to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also revealed in the case of aid personnel employed in the German Bundestag.
The saving measures of practically all the southern EU countries will undoubtedly go beyond the same state in which people are forced to emigrate (as it was in the 19th century) under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of their social level, or to seek a hunger salary on the edge of society, hoping that some time private investment capital will flow into the country.
Here, naturally, the question arises where this capital comes from?
If it comes from another EU country, only poverty moves from one country to another; or the capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa at all, the workers work for a fraction of the European wages.
This applies to Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim to exaggerate that the state is not allowed to participate with capital in its own economy, and that planned economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
The private capital insists strictly on its point of view that the state should not be guidingly interfering in the economy.
But then one must wonder whether or not the private capital influences the politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practically all-powerful and all-powerful lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, mutual distribution, a legislation in which practically everything is strict, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is that a state ministry is charged with a lack of finance private, closely connected with the industry legal companies with the preparation of draft laws.
These draft laws will then be adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence then comes no longer from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracies are now rapidly falling into a situation, as Appian describes in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompeius: “The state has long been understood in the collapse, and the offices have been occupied with violence.
against smell money, by illegal relief of benefits or with stone and sword.
The corruption grew impaiently, and the people went to the election with already purchased voices” ... “People with character didn’t appeal for office, so that the state, as a result of this decline, had no consul for eight months” ... “It was really beginning to talk about that the only medicine in this difficult situation is a solitary domination, and that a strong man must be elected...” Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was then finally Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy by solitary domination.
As it shows, today’s society, as in ancient times, is based on the unconscious preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to the overall social interests.
The private capital is unable, by its nature, to recognize and maintain the benefit for the whole society.
The result, today as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites who do not at least pursue deeper reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism must therefore be found in the unconscious liberalization of the economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From the current situation, the fall of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain break, in which the next round is already marked.
Particularly catastrophic is the fact that today’s elites are in full ignorance of the possible future losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives, the humanitarian and social disasters we are already witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity, as we know them from the old and new history.
The abolition of the law on non-profit works is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the state’s capital participation in the economy, increase the citizens’ influence on the government, and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in the benefit of the state.
The Lab of Chaos.
"... that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise" Sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain is: "... so we don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, there would be no one," says the dead Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip there was, as usual, a number of reactions.
One stands behind Israel and arguments with its right to self-defense, while they call the Palestinians terrorists; the others, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and call the State Israel terrorist.
I do not want to write here about who is guilty and who is a victim in these repeated waves of death; ultimately, the present-day residents of Israel, including the self-government areas, have been born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself.
It’s about opening the look behind the scenes to the readers, the look at who the 95 years of tension (right from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small piece of land in the Middle East are most useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and come from my own understanding of who or which group of people influence the events of modern history significantly.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it really always were those personalities themselves that autonomously determined their steps, or whether behind their throne was someone who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must acknowledge that we live in a time in which the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of less individuals, and that this concentration of money and power that arises from it has not emerged within the life of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families there is a special one that can be called the head of the cracks (I don't know if anyone else stands over them, but I don't conclude this) - the Rothschilds.
Much is not written about them.
of understanding.
The first press agency (Reuters) was purchased by the Rothschilds in the 90s of the 19th century to interrupt the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, in the background of which always stood the consolidation of their power, the multiplication of their wealth or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks in the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they conduct wars or rush on them (for the attack on Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq it was 5 countries, after the collapse of Gaddafi only four remained, with Russia in the meantime submitting its central bank to the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to resist this family had to pay for it with life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as a central bank, began to issue his own (such as state) banknotes during the Civil War and was murdered in 1865 in a theater.
J.F. Kennedy began issuing his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; the MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to prosecute the FED for the eradication of the world economic crisis in 1929.
In the years 1859-1871, the Rothschild’s global power leaves led to the formulation of a plan for the defeat of three world wars by Albert Pik, a liberator of the 33th and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was intended to eradicate the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war was intended to break the colonial domination of Great Britain, and the third war was intended to reduce the world’s population to approximately 0.5 – 1 billion people (this number would take care of their convenience and luxury and would not consume so many resources), to create a universal religion (ecumenism here is nothing more than the predecessor) and eventually lead to the acquisition of absolute power.
The method with which the group of wealthiest families works with the Rothschilds at the top is the solving of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chao - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to the worsening of the situation (see the foundation of the FED so that crises like the crises they solved in 1907 do not repeat).
After they managed to trigger the First World War through the assassination of the Habsburg throne successor Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Tsar Empire through the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Tsar Empire the war was no longer necessary), then the dissolution of the Central European Great Power of Austria-Hungary took place.
In order to simplify the Second World War, the banks through politics created a latent conflict situation by invading Germany with giant war repairs; thus they created the prerequisite of armed masses, so that they had to subjugate the Germans only a sufficiently strong leader who offered the guilty and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multinational state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should take on the function of a fifth column and also took on to dissolve the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century the Rothschilds initiated the foundation of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought the foundation of a Jewish state, as possible on the historic territory of Judah with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The already mentioned Balfour Declaration created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there came first collisions with the settled Arab population.
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler disappeared from the chain at which the international banks had initially held him, or if everything went as planned, it is hard to estimate, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as well as the war repairs against Germany prepared the ground for the Second World War, the expulsion of the State of Israel represents the creation of the fireplace for the Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in dissolving this war, the Jewish people, like in the Second World War, will become a victim in the front line, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (think only how sharp people divide themselves into Israel’s supporters and opponents).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where injustice only causes injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with at the beginning the enthusiasm of individuals and their pursuit of global power?
There must be a distinction between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international banks in Israel as well as with us, the people, put exclusively their own candidates for choice.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal to international bankers politician who is doing everything to unleash a war with Iran, which, given Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), could rapidly spread to a global conflict, and in which it could result in a destruction of the world economy due to Iran’s control over the only 2 miles wide road of Hormus, which runs over 20% of the world’s oil supplies.
In 1994 David Rockefellers said, “The only thing we need is a crisis that enlarges everything, and people will welcome the new world order.”
In their conception, the new world order is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted a chip at birth to submit this being to total control.
“And it makes that the little and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give themselves a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, that no one can buy or sell, for he has the mark, namely the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Whoever has wisdom thinks the number of the animal.
For it is a number of man, and his number is six hundred and seventy-six."
The movie Argo: When it's worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of protesting Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the shaken Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had kept the patronate over his regime for decades.
For the U.S. government there was no positive way out of this situation – it couldn’t afford to throw the chess over the boat, as this would have massively damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was unable, in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, to carry out the liberation of the hostages.
It was a heavy blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasko in the violent attempt to release captives made everything even worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations were mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages raised a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran mood at home.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small part victory.
Soon before the occupation of the embassy, six ambassador personnel managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, succeeded in bringing refugees out of Iran, helping them a extravagant story to hide their true identity – they travel with Canadian passports carved as members of a film stabe who allegedly visited the country for a science fiction film.
The combination of genres
The plan developed by the "Exfiltration" expert, Tony Mendez, also made the collaboration of Hollywood necessary.
In order to become credible, articles about this film project appeared in specialized journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks Film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", that is, the story of a successful Husaren piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the mood levels in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the filming of the same situations there are no big differences).
On the other hand, the mild passages from Hollywood, which ironically and slightly overwhelmed therefore come.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA’s center and other institutions – men in tracks on the meeting table, on the office flows, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a re-start of his career with this film.
From a smiled actor he has become a respectful director, and even as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third film after the Crime No Children's Game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller City Without Grace (2010).
At the same time, it’s Afflecks’ first film that doesn’t play in the director’s home Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that removed the previous films of this director from the Hollywood standard.
Affleck, however, proves this feeling also in Argo, where Tehran is “played” by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have actually occurred – the entry sequence of the messaging turmoil is very impressive in its clarity, and yet transmits the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when somewhere the story moves.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck with his team in fictional scenes (the false film stage on a basar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story actually does not offer many exciting scenes in the film sense.
But with the Less he works quite successfully, sometimes he helps something to the reality – which then doesn’t always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Tehran is removed by a telephone call in America, or even the pursuit on the start line, seem somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its too broad spread, which is conditioned by the need to show too much of action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters would have earned more space, and thus they are far from alone in the film.
Afflecks film is a film that can be followed with a certain interest while gutting the design and the retro style that reminds of a thriller from the 1970s.
It is difficult to raise enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history that is lively to date and as a proof of how overwhelmed the concepts of the all-powerful and all-known intelligence services are, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for air balloon, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which quotes an annual survey of the most absurd bank fees, has decided this year to host the competition "The absurdest regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"On this idea, the EU's recent plan to introduce a 40% female share in the management of large European companies brought us," Patrik Nacher, who takes care of the organization of this survey, told Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of the insurance tariffs for men and women.
Until then, women had a benefit in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
"Another incredible insights from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The real vote will then be held until the end of February 2013,” afterwards said.
The controversial EU regulations include, among other things, the binding mix of bioethanol with fuel that is consequently harmful to nature, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or the directive on the size of chickens, due to which the eggs became significantly more expensive this year.
Criticism in the past also denied the actual prohibition of the use of the term "butter upstream" or the prohibition of the sale of traditional lamps.
Bananas must be 14 cm long.
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of that or that lobby of trade and industry, whose claims in Brussels are usually represented by one or more Member States (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to meet the claims of the Czech banks even with a veto threat).
The lobby interests also stood behind the fact that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have "crumbling anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it merely harmonizes the ununitary national standards that would hinder trade.
The rules on fruits and vegetables have already been dismissed by the EU against the resistance of some countries, indicating that the previous directives would lead to food waste.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the last year’s EU regulation, which must be provided in accordance with airballons when they are sold, indicating that children under eight years of age should not blow the airballon out without the supervision of an adult.
The EU applied to a U.S. study that says airballons are the leading cause of children’s vomiting.
A similar limitation already applies to children up to 14 years of age in the use of Annual Market Streets.
Curious intrusions are at home.
Relatively absurd is also a directive that affects the European officials themselves – anyone who takes an official position in the EU may not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the topic to Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, also nominated the EU Regulation on the scope of food supplies on the territory of a Member State.
Thus, the EU determined the maximum amount of food reserves that could be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our EU accession.
The Czech Republic then, for example, exceeded the fixed volume for fungal conserve, which threatened us with a high penalty.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for the fact that they have no sea, or by the idea of giving funds for applications for funds.
These ideas did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
“We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea.
We will apply for a refund from the EU,” said then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the grain harvest was very high and the state warehouses were overfilled as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to sea ports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission ended with the Czech Republic so far that it organized an offer on the purchase of grains from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The Ministry of Regional Development under the leadership of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU) offered funds for subsidy applications to the municipalities, specifically it should be the funds for subsidy applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations are easily targeted by criticism in the Member States, the EU’s efforts to regulate and thus to ensure the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole, some experts think, however, deserve more recognition.
A more serious problem, according to these experts, is the EU funding for projects which have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which have been forced by the budget negotiations by individual Member States.
Emotions in this country also highlight the fact that the Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, must fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win this struggle.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the term "Olomoucké tvarůžky" after a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the inlanderrum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, however, our manufacturers had to be renamed "Tuzemák".
The term rum may only be used for products made of sugar tube distillate, not for products made of sugar tube.
In the official list of the products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheese varieties Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipans or Parmaschinkens now also appear the Karlsbader Zwieback, Karpfen from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or even the Saazer Hopfen.
With a EU brand, the Pardubicer bread cakes or the Hořicer roles can be brushed.
“People want me to save the Republic, but I’m just an amateur,” Okamura said.
Mr Senator, how do you get to the idea of nominating for the presidency?
I don’t want to be a senator or president.
If everything in our country would work without problems, I’t go anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been plundered for 20 years, how thieves are running around freely, while people are increasing the taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But if I see something I don’t like, then I try to propose a solution to change it.
And since I’m over 40, and therefore independent and partial, I don’t have any other way to influence things than to candidate for the post of a senator or president.
In the Senate you succeeded and then immediately made yourself on the way to the castle.
Do you not turn your voters back?
I have always said to myself that I will take on the struggle for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later I specified this and said that I will be a candidate for the office of the President if I am elected to the Senator.
But my goal is not the function; the function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and a strongest mandate as possible.
But the difficulty is not only in the fact that we, as a people, are cheating in the cabin and in front of the television, but in the fact that we are cheating anyone who wants to change something.
This comes from the media that want to steal the honor, and that confuses the freedom of speech with the freedom of lie.
For example, I was claimed to be a journalist or to be a consultant for Jiří Paroubek.
Let’s talk about your visions.
The struggle for the castle has begun with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with back-effective asset statements over 20 million crowns.
You need to change the laws.
As a president, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can submit legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I used myself to ensure that the travel guide remains a free business, and this could be implemented.
The problem is the minority policy - if someone comes from right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the people.
As an independent party member, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is the best for our country without any party dogm and subjects.
Do you see yourself as a man in politics rather right or left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are more likely to see me left.
For me, this right-link thinking is completely irrelevant.
For me it is important that we continue.
It doesn’t matter if someone belongs to the left or right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support every good approach to the solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You fail when someone calls you populists.
But do you not confirm this by what you just said?
If you make a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And that is what you want to approach.
For me, this can be called populism, but all the proposals I have talked about already work in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without the support of the parliament, you will only have a key word.
And this does not get far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you only talk long enough with the people, will you succeed, for example, in carrying out the material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to bring them to our side in order to these goals.
As a president, it would not be a problem for me to ask the chairs of the parliamentary parties live on television to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And then the promised must say why they refuse this.
A strong personality that indicates misconduct can exercise pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I just started with politics and try to find the support of the majority for my program.
I always try to judge the things myself; and if it doesn’t work, then I’m going back to the private sector in six years.
It sounds a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that I do nothing alone; that’s why I talked with several well-known people about whether they don’t want to candidate for the Senate as well.
For example, I talked to Radim Jančura, who refused because of the workload.
In addition, I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered the fraud in the lightweight oil trade.
I started my candidacy with the assumption that people are deeply unhappy, but now I’m not sure anymore.
Sixteen percent of voters have not gone to the election at all, and those who have gone have mostly chosen representatives of the establishment.
We are only two independent people in the Senate.
The people have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will only be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example, for the direct election of the mayor and district leaders.
Are you thinking about creating your own party?
I haven’t yet thought about it because I don’t have time to review the past of any potential party member, and I don’t have any money for it.
I don’t even have money for the presidential campaign; in my transparent account there are just 20,000 CZK.
Do you have no money?
Are you talking about asset statements, how do you look?
My private assets are estimated at about 60 million CZK.
In Prague I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb worth about a million.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a child's dream - James Bond always liked how he was driving in the car, galant to women, and at the same time fought against evil.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, have a wealth of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
They say you want to change the republic, but your own money you don’t want to invest in it.
This is not exactly convincing.
I don’t have $15 million for the campaign.
Should I make debts?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that my program probably doesn’t raise too much interest.
And I am not obliged to challenge the campaign by my own means.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live from the senator’s income alone; so, for example, I could not fund my son’s English school, which costs 30,000 per month.
If I only wanted to make money, I would not vote for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to get your outcomes?
Did you not say that you’re going to take these activities back?
But that doesn’t depend on the salary.
As I promised, I have partially returned my activities.
For example, my deputy representative will become the manager of the travel agency in the spring.
The people want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
I also have to live from something.
What monthly income did you get used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that’s still so.
As a president, I would set up my business.
The full conversation can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not just in mind - on the example of spijkenisse and the recently built Book Mountains - 2 photos
“I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there’s something interesting to see again,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passant on the street.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby large business, says, “But, it’s pretty, the house.”
But I wonder why we need a library today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and eBooks.
No one is volunteer to any of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenisse, a hardly visited sleeping town in front of the gates of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000 inhabitants community has the lowest education rate in all of the Netherlands.
To counter this stupid circumstance, a few years ago, a decision was made to contribute to general education and to rebuild the seven fictional bridges that are displayed on the Eurocards as beautiful pinched steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive remained within the boundaries.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become the master of statistics: a library must come!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam Architecture Bureau MVRDV, master of the great-künne balcony diagrams and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with usual calmness and appeared to the competition hearing year 2003 with five books under the arm and a laughter in the face.
And while the jury was still blindly looking around and wrapped with the axes, the wicked maas dropped his chosen summit of size to a pyramid and ended his actionistly understood speech with the words: "Dear city community!"
So this is he, my proposal for the Book Mountains of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euros expensive mountain was erupted.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes deep garage, supermarket, post and a few adjacent houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Bookerberg was awarded the second "Best Library of NL 2012" award.
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the outlookless small-storey facilities, which so far had no more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian area and an untouchable wicked council, behind whose white facades one would tend to suspect a milk factory to make a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public culture in its history.
The long way to the book
The first impression: Bookeldorado under the rubber.
Although there is an elevator that leads through the mountain massive, the true space and reading pleasures open up with the foot-by-step airing of the topography.
The surrounded interior is bright and transparent, the bright clink floor and the elegant street lights speak the language of a public city square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You are already looking for the park bank, the dog and the boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books, and books.
“Normally the book rails stand along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is mostly uncomfortable and unpersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We put the classic room configuration on the head and scattered the reading area from inside to outside.
The interior of the Book Mountains is smartly used: in the center are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and home engineering center.
A special pleasure are the black book rails, which are sometimes wall clothing, sometimes breastfeeding, sometimes stiegenglanders.
Optics, haptics and odors are strange.
Even intrigued architects and construction engineers shake the head of the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the City Council of Spijkenisse, on the request of the standard.
And so we met one day in a Friesland agricultural plant on a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, in the Netherlands, a millimeter thin plastic vlies has been used as a root underground in greenhouses and fields.
It is cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile holds one, two seasons, then it is mature for the block waste.
For the library, the vlies was printed - for the first time in these amounts - to four centimeters thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) is colored into a dark, homogeneous, loadable material that smells a bit for new cars and a bit for sports shoes.
After 105 stages, you have reached the top.
At the end of the almost 500 meters long tour you will be rewarded in the literature cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and drowned ficus trees.
They ensure the atmosphere, but above all the right moisture in the literature mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You't believe it, but this house, despite the many glass surfaces, is a showcase project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with earth heat.
Although the Bookerberg stands under a glass break, the sun, even in sunny days, only shines shortly inside.
The widespread wooden leaves, which stand around the glass facade, serve as a cover and capture a large part of the solar radiation.
The space climate is very pleasant.
The rest is done by fully automatic rolls.
Stefan Spermon, the primary skeptic of the IT industry, has already waged the way to the new library.
Lisette Pregnancy was there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Boekenberg the "longest surviving soul."
The reason: For opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
This will now fill out the optical holes in the not yet fully covered library – currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has come up.
The boxes are filled up to the top.
“Nothing is worse than a half-greater library,” says architect Winy Maas.
“I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
If it is only a quarter.
Thus, MVRDV has succeeded in that royal discipline, which is called in the Specialty Jargon Identity Foundation.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
So young and uneducated she may be.
This is a point of view for identity.
Szabo: “German must play a bigger role”
Germany voted on the acceptance of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in U.S.-European relations, Berlin is balancing at a small diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany had initially signaled that it would vote against the request for the status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.
Then there was Berlin.
Why ?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Germany must be cautious because of its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe it does not support the American position as well.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – without being too critical to Israel.
During the March 2011 Rebellion in Libya, Germany also voted for the establishment of a flight ban zone.
This was finally adopted by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yes that is true.
This is because it just turns its foreign policy away from a policy that is said to be managed by the United States to a German foreign policy.
It adds that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans are opposed between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to it.
I think they’re still getting closer to their role, but they’re on the way to a “normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy like France or the UK.
What does a “normal” foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests have influenced the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First, Germany has large retail markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be cautious not to hit the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
This definitely plays a role.
But I’t want to give it too much weight, that’s not a completely unilateral relationship.
But it plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by engaging in important voting decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding of the German position.
That’s why I don’t think this was such a dramatic breakthrough as in the Libyan issue.
Germany may have a certain respect for it.
Because it is a sign that it is taken seriously as an international player and his interests must be considered.
There are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States has clearly voted for a veto.
Are there differences between the United States and many European nations?
Due to American internal policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama secretly has quite a lot of understanding of the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government can not, of course, represent this position publicly.
I think the actual differences are not as big as they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so excited about Netanyahu’s policy.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree on its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and on the position of the key partners in the EU on the other?
That’s what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is currently not the case.
So they cannot be part of a wider line and instead have to move things out of their own position.
You do that with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of its relations with Israel.
It has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they need to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international player - does Germany want to take a major role?
Is the leadership of Germany still difficult?
Germany is not yet used to that, that is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the Eurocrisis, every time Germany takes a greater role, various anti-German feelings are released.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
That’s actually the old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be acceptable to the most diverse neighbors and opinions and that’s not easy.
Now the influence of the U.S. in European policy is constantly decreasing, but the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment, who else remains there?
The Germans will have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and makes it much more unpleasant - c'est la vie!
Stephen Szabo is Deputy Director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institution where academics and political experts from Europe and North America jointly investigate the challenges of the transatlantic community.
Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he has specialized in German politics, U.S. foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
"Market Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren too.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind it is a name that is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the origin companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the real names don’t complain.
And even then it is not clear if they are right.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week there is a new case on my desk.
The followers are already sufficient a few additional letters so that they can register their trademarks.
So from Gucci simply becomes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
Also German companies are legally copied in this way, such as the sports item manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations from the brand office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protected the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an art name that also served at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese world champions are in copying and in injured intellectual property.
In the big cities there are multi-storey shops that almost exclusively sell counterfeits.
But Pattloch’s cases are different: on behalf of his customers, he opposed that Chinese companies are officially granted the right from the Brand Office to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is referred to as “Bang Dakuan”.
This means women who fishing rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of their fault.
“This is business harmful, you have to fight it,” Pattloch calls.
“The brand is moisturized, the single setting disappears, the image damage is huge.”
The financial failures and the process costs of the affected industries go to the millions, especially with expensive promotional products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China, with a volume of €15 billion a year, is the third-largest market for luxury items and the fastest growing.
However, deletions of doubtful entries in the brand register are difficult to reach and go into money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can be extended, with uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court rejected the complaint because after the long duration the contested name has become a “market reality”.
If the prosecutor is sad, he will even have to pay the plagiarism because he has damaged his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also affect graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer.
Therefore, the Chinese can still use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the dispute was solved, Geely had to change it.
The fashion maker Lacoste lost in China against descendants from Hong Kong and Singapore who let the famous crocodile look in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of their guilt.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing acknowledges that there have been interruptions in 2010 due to too little staff and space equipment.
Last year, however, it has been “back to normal” from the emergency in the work process.
The amount of unprocessed complaints has decreased by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75% more than last year.
However, 81,500 complaints are still waiting for completion.
Combating it costs a lot
As many times in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection were submitted to CTMO, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China will add the list of new reports worldwide for the tenth time in a row, the authority said.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were charged.
Simply, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To deal with this, it costs a lot, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been struggling with a Chinese plagiarist.
However, the Germans were able to that their illegal manufacturing of imitated motor vehicle parts was exhausted.
However, the successor continued to secure the Chinese rights on the brand Freudenberg.
We have missed this because in Germany family names could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also rejected the Munich’s objection.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the opponent continues to struggle until today.
You need to be careful
The case is now ongoing before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely expensive and it takes us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs were hardly referred to, the corporate archive had even to review a hundred-year-old documents to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg faultly offered the opposite side a "high six-point euro bill" to resolve.
“You can see how much it is worth us,” Wentzler says.
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to go back to Europe.
Then, if there imitators secure unprotected brands.
So a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to sign the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business field has long abandoned the group, yet it was able to withdraw the registration.
“You have to be careful,” Wentzler says.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advised German companies to be very cautious when trading with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather, foreigners should "all that is somehow protected should be registered even in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg is subject to the last act of his markendrama, then you probably have to pay the opposite party license fees for his own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the relevant segment.
World Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the chor tries Imbongi - and in Swasiland, AIDS people are happy about it.
The history of a connection that is far more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there is the stamping: cowboy shoes, basketball shoes, women's pumps and gentleman's slopes look for the tact on the parket floor, find it quickly.
One-two to three to four.
Then first the voices of the singers slowly swallow - Old, Bass, Tenor and Sopran - strike, interfere and pursue themselves.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, almost lifts it out of his tissue shoes when he brings it together with his smooth wild gestures.
It’s Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the chor Imbongi tries a new song.
The fifty singers have come, between the ages of 23 and 69, from the Humangenetiker to the Houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, every cortex has a different text and this is still in a very strange language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self-Help
There are around 34 million HIV infected worldwide, which estimates Unaids, the United Nations program to fight AIDS.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
In Switzerland, there are 245,000 people affected by AIDS.
More than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS people in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa has found Paten in Germany.
70 of them attend an advanced school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take a patent.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in Zulu stories or even praise prizes.
The Bantus language can fluently speak in this room no one can, but sing.
For a decade, the Chor has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and sometimes bringing them back to where they originated: to the southern Africa.
For 8,733 kilometers away from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the kingdom of Swasiland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voice force of the German Chore.
40 percent are infected.
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple leather and straw houses, most of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents because they are exposed to the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, the small shows what all of Switzerland is sick: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to Unicef.
Cuts of the male precoce, which have proven to decrease the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than 40 percent of people in Swasiland carry the immune weakness virus in itself, dying at mid-thirty is not a rare thing.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the Chor discovered the village, but above all the Imbongis saw a lot of children on the streets, who did not only lack parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without graduation, there is no chance in a poor country.
At first it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal per day.
But a year later, the chor founded the association “Voices for Africa”, which has since been professional in the AIDS vaccines in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STIs include Syphilis, Chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhoea).
Frequent viral STIs are HIV, humane papillomavirus, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Files and cracks belong to the parasitic STIs.
Who are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and Tripper occur especially in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five of all cases of syphilis in Germany are transmitted through sexual intercourse between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidosis (pilz), tripper and humane papillomavirus are commonly occurring sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in this country – yet about 20 percent of HIV new infections occur in this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur much more frequently than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
Humane papillomavirus is also common in young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are compulsory.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has declined since 2007.
In 2011 there were approximately 2,700 cases.
That is about a tenth less than the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause wrinkles in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, output, underbuilding pain, as well as blisters or wrinkles.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide a hundred percent protection.
Because, in part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through smell infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially in frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosed, most STIs can be cured and delays can be avoided.
Through patterns, donations, and not least the gains that the chor appears throughout Germany, a lot comes together.
“In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and persistent woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also cares for the orphans to be good at one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women on Zulu are called, are the supporters of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans, giving them a roof over their heads, and ensuring that the children in their uniform appear timely to school lessons every day.
Whoever doesn’t have anyone anymore comes to the protector’s house to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid as much as the two chefs who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, “Voices for Africa” has launched a nine school, built two chicken houses and jointly organized with the American health organization PSI that many people in the village have a HIV test.
This is not obvious, because as obviously the disease is all over the country, you prefer to silence it dead.
A King with 14 Wives
“Aids is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
In fact, it’s strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy rather than democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned form of life that the HI virus has spread so quickly in the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms are available in every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another – flesh to flesh.”
To promote cultural exchanges, the Imbongi-Chor travels through South Africa every two or three years and sings songs full of wrath, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many on the southern peak of the black continent know from the times of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language - so much recognition brings not only mood and joy, but has already drowned a few tears to some cruel border soldiers.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their patents.
Even though the small village is hardly found on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than known.
“Go to Esitjeni, there is the light,” the people there say.
And if you return the 8733 kilometers airline to Heidelberg, to the stumbling singers in the test room on the Bergheimer Street, then you can see it also shine there.
NASA finds ice on Mercury
The Sonde Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, according to three studies published on Thursday in the journal Science.
The Sonde Messenger has found evidence that there is a ice cover in the permanently shadowed region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or asteroids that have been hit on the Mercury.
No one brings the discovery of ice but connected with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the messenger sonde, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other stones of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the Earth’s citizens, the satellites, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of the space.
From time to time, they send images to the Earth: Small scenes in infinite widths.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dragon planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which rotates the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the 2006 International Astronomical Union.
This screenshot of an infrared capture from the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless star generations: the oldest stars are as blue points to be recognized, the more difficult to identify are the pink "newborns" in the star circle.
This star-shaping region - by scientists unromantically called W5 - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the star image Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This glittering glut of a dying star has captured the NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
The Donut-shaped ring consists of the material that the star revealed in the process of death.
In the enormous Trifid cloud, 5400 light years away from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope shot this photo of the galaxy’s birth tube.
The plejadic star heap, also known as "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the simple eye.
With the telescope, the colors are better applied.
Like a red age, the Helix cloud on this infrared photo looks in front of the spectator.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius star image.
His similarity to a terrestrial continent brought this cloud to the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures the spectacular color setting.
This baby star, in its full beauty, could only be captured by the Infrared Detectors of the Spitzer Telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How these are formed is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Per they are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared tracelessly 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and sharpest recordings of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on coloring, recordings of spiral galaxies become real artworks.
The recording published by the European Southern Observatory shows the several thousand light years away Trifid Nebula in the Star Picture of Shield.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (triparted, triparted), as dark dust streams tripart the glowing heart of the star’s birthplace.
Astronomers have photographed the predecessors of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light years away from the Earth, the knees of two mergering galaxies rise to each other and will inevitably collide.
This star-born recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Whoever does not have technical abbreviations, he may call them by his top name Southern Firebike.
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a cut from the iris cloud in the star image of Kepheus.
The 1400 light-years away cloud consists of dust cells that are ten to a hundred times smaller than the usual household dust.
This image was combined from optical and X-ray images from various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, took the Hubble space telescope for NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star cloud is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The star wings are always producing new Youngstars.
Even these star wolves, associated with the rosette cloud, are constantly bringing up new baby stars - 5,000 light years away from the Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust, but only gas.
Researchers suspect it was created shortly after the Urknall, when mostly hydrogen was found in the universe.
Our Insights into All: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become increasingly bigger – and the insights they provide are increasingly deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world’s largest remote tunnel.
The mirror, here on the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, the U.S. is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It lets look into the whole equally over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior life of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary island of La Palma is enormous - alone the mirror reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the South African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
However, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the convenient mode of construction: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height.
Its particularity: the high light collection power.
This, despite a relatively small mirror diameter, reaches the world’s largest mirror telescope.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers hear the all after extraterrestrial signals.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing data performance.
The Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope – which makes its name all honor.
With its total four mirrors, the remote door can also light the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the ESO Observatory in Chile.
Its main level is set to cover 42 meters - and is set together from about 1000 mirror elements.
The images are expected at the beginning of 2018.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer equal two mirrors with an average of ten meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which next to them still looks into heaven with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea, a new, enormous telescope will be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is on an illustration.
The most important impressions from the universe, however, are provided by the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990 it has already delivered images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets – mostly those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1235 planet candidates have been identified since the beginning of the mission.
The picture is documented with the latest launch preparations at the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched in early 2018 on board an Ariane5 missile.
The primary level of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for light from the first stars and galaxies to the urnall.
Scientists predict that there is ice in the South Pole of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as the messenger is far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have indicated for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Through the messenger satellite launched in 2004 – the first to circle around Mercury – the scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter every day and get 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trace search in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trace search in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch mountains is wild-romantic.
The small bus runs over the curved road, passing through tightened mountains, floating rivers and simple farming houses.
Everything is green and sweet, you could think you were in the black forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian population of the Talis, of which little is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Aseric and is very long-lasting.
The final station is Lerik.
The small town is filled with excessive architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the arrival from Azerbaijan’s capital Baku is too difficult.
For the 323 kilometers it takes eight hours, because the road is only one-purge.
The remarkable wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the thing to tourist attraction.
“Baku became famous with the Eurovision Song Festival in May – and next year we will have a festival of the world’s oldest people,” Fatulayeva says.
She is the director of the museum for longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the Vita is documented by about eight dozen Talis from the area, which is older than 100.Fatulayeva shows on a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
A child was born at the age of 136 years.
But the controversial star of the museum is the Shepherd Şirali Muslimov, who is supposed to be 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented man, who was 122 years old, Muslimov’s age seems extremely doubtful.
"1805 he was born here in the region, 1973 he died," Fatulayeva explains.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he said he had a daughter.
So has Şirali Muslimov accounted for a few decades at his age?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the high-level in Central Asia.
“In fact, many high-age people are also in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “even in Sardinia live extremely many very old men.”
However, due to the lack of documents, there is no scientific proof of age to be provided, especially because the personal status registers were missing.
Every day mixed butter
But the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik often impressively reach a biblical age.
Currently there are 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why do so many people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talis.
The museum director Fatulayeva, on the contrary, believes that it lies in the diet.
But that exactly the calorie-rich diet of the talys should be so healthy, who love meat, bread and above all dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter a day, does not seem just plausible from the nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original lifestyle that keeps people young? in Cengemiran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With her 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter sheet that untouchedly rolls her down and down.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayev's sons and a daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Two kids also jump around.
In the kitchen, the guests are preparing tea, served in the typical, structural Armadu glasses.
Mirzaeva’s white teeth are perfectly in rear and membrane, under her headache she hides long, dark-blonde spots that her son proudly reveals before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out of me and kept their color.
“I’ve never used shampoo either,” Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She has always eaten what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, herbs.
I’ve never bought food at a supermarket a single time.
Then she tells her about her husband who was in the army.
The worst was in the time after World War II.
But everything became better when the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the row.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, hardly knows boundaries in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, and later his son Ilham took over the router.
After all, there is no need among the ancients of Azerbaijan.
230 Manat (approximately the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for domestic relations an amount of which you can live well.
And maybe Mirzayev’s long-established son is right: “The elders enjoy praise in our culture.”
They live in the middle of the big family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If this is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word “human rights” is missing in the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivalising claims in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with the sharia as the basis is heavily controversial.
The Egyptian president does not save with Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
“And that he succeeds lies in my responsibility, before the people and before God,” he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but to the Christian Copts, the liberals, the illuminated Muslims and the secularists.
Because they all, so far hopelessly broken in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a divine state on the Nile of graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He has, according to Mohammed Mursi, almost apologizing, temporarily cut down the jurisdictions of the Constitutional Court and expanded his jurisdictions “to save the revolution.”
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who carries a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are about, the world is not quite aware of.
Should the judgment be dismissed?
In fact, the 234 articles, which were passed through by the Islamist-dominated 100-hour constitutional assembly in a nightly, 15-hour parforcerite, are partially worrying.
As in previous constitutions, it is also stated in the draft that the jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
What is “principles”?
This was and is an explanation matter, and there is fear that the Islamists will use the wicked formulation and the associated legal barrier for a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
At least one newly added article suggests that in all the matters relating to the Sharia, the Al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamic institution, with great radiation in the entire Sunni Islam, must be drawn up.
This does not have to be done, but it may mean that the spirituality oversee the legislation, which de facto would result in the dismantling of the judgment.
Many things in the draft constitution are an interpretation matter.
It is also problematic: Civil military justice should continue to beined.
These courts served during Mubarak's rule to oppress oppositionists.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military prison.
The state should also, as it is stated in the draft, “protect the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “protect their morality and values”.
This is legally so unclear that state institutions could even control the contents of film art and literature with the help of this article.
Clearly, this means nothing but censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly states the equality of men and women.
For this reason, another is prohibited from offending or misleading the Prophet Mohammed and his Messengers.
But what is an offense and how it should be punished remains unclear.
Similarly dubiously, the formulation suggests that “insulting people” is prohibited.
Is it enough for a cartoon of the president or a joke at the expense of a law teacher?
Interpretation matter, as much in the draft, that Mursi is presented to sign and according to his words "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for the referendum.
“The revolution has returned.”
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the overpower of the Islamists.
Thousands of people gathered in an unusual gathering on Friday evening on the Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to bring the Charter down before it could enter into force.
“The revolution has come back and we’ll win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, the third place in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former chief of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei said the draft constitution belongs "on the rubbish of history".
Through a short news service on Twitter, he told Mursis’ supporters that he wanted to lead a “push against democracy.”
“If he calls on the referendum, we’ll go to his palace and destroy it,” opposition leader Jasser Said said.
“We’re not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not sweetened yet,” the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, making it invalid.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution.”
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, on its part, blamed to a district demonstration, but warning not on the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer before the University of Cairo.
Many hidden women and followers of the Salafists took part in the event and cried, “The people call for the application of God’s law.”
They asked Mursi, “Pur the land!” and said, “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
A struggle for the Highness over the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which everything started, would probably have promised civil war-like conditions.
Mursis supporters obviously did not want to risk that.
The Muslim Brothers said both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters had spoken loud and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people on the election to decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the Islamist proposal is considered safe.
“The word human rights does not even come.”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which would actually have gone until February and had to unite all the social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brothers when they sat in prison under Mubarak or stood in court.
Not because he would share their view of the world, but because human rights are inseparable to him.
For this he was raped, convicted, imprisoned.
“And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution,” he complained in a conversation with the World on Sunday.
Mursi's extension of power to all three powers in the state allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are clare violations of democratic game rules and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civil society, the president de facto puts it off," Saeda complains.
Without civil society, democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels alone, even by the international community, who sees the ideological direction struggle in the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be fooling.
A demonstrant on the Tahrir warns, “You’re giving a monster that you can’t control anymore.”
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the worst fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living – and that’s not only in Europe, but throughout the world.
Could the country’s success secret have anything to do with the local appetite for quite offensive fish?
You take a selection of overwhelming keys.
They are placed in the middle of a hole of dirty, wet sports clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
So about, you have to imagine the narcotic smell of Rakfisk, one of the great delicates of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There’s snow here, spectacular landscapes – and this enduring smell in the air that simply doesn’t want to disappear.
Rakfisk is a salt-covered forel that - depending on how stinking you would like your fish - is fermented in water for up to a year.
When in Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather gets cold, Norwegians flow to a party here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, now, really very existing specialty.
"You eat it raw and then wash it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local firefighters, but as the so-called "Rakfisk General" also organizes the festival.
Around us, people eat small fish crabs and take large amounts of alcohol.
“People like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk,” Havard says.
Alcohol can remove the smell.
I cost a few hips.
If you avoid bringing the Rakfisk near the nose, it’s not bad – like Sushi, which has a quite long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poor Norwegian era, when there were no cooling opportunities yet and fish was drunk in air-differentiated saltwater pools in the autumn.
In the deepest winter, it was then removed after long fermentation and - undoubtedly under the help of alcohol-depressed senses - consumed.
Until a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and mostly moved to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a flourishing labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, which not so long ago was much richer than Norway, immigrants flow.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important – as an essential but strictly smelling part of the Norwegian history.
It is one of the most expensive foods you can buy here.
But in fact, everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proudly 10 euros.
Norway doesn’t get it often in the world press, and most people don’t seem to bother it.
Here it is still hated to call Anders Breivik by name - those racist right-wing extremists who killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, we are referring only to the “July 22 incident.”
Norwegians make it hard to accept that someone in their peaceful country is capable of such brutal murders.
The main responsible for today’s wealth of Norway has been the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world since the early 1970s.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our servant, which distributes round tablets with mature rakfisk and shapes the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and the stumbling blue eyes.
We are, as they say, a cautious people.
Your English is just like that of most people here.
We are not very anger, we don’t like prayer.
Norway has been treated very carefully with its oil wealth – a large part of industry revenues is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When in the years before the global economic crisis everyone was throwing around with money that they did not possess, Norway kept its wallets closed.
“As long as we can ski in winter and walk in summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
“And, of course, eat Rakfisk,” she adds with a hard laugh.
I’m standing in the snow and applying for another dish – from Rakfisk I have enough.
Such an elch burger is something different. the sweet meat mourns me.
In the evening, the fish is on the food plan.
The hotel where I log in is one of several events that organize a Rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best - or the most challenging smell - fish.
There is a live TV switch to a showmaster dressed with flies, surrounded by teller with rakfisk.
The show is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
“What score do you have there up in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?”
“There are our points, Havard.”
You cry and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by Aquavit.
But it may be the strict dune of the whole fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto is facing a difficult start.
While Mexico's future president Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing for his post, Will Grant from the BBC analyses the challenges he is facing and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is very bad.
Even in better days, this is a constantly stuck city, but on Monday a steel ring was built that blocked several important traffic routes to the capital and caused chaos on the streets.
But the goal was not to disrupt pendlers on the way to work, but to prevent protesters from getting to parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto will take over the presidency and take over the nation's leadership.
He is faced with a complex task.
Under the separating government of Felipe Calderons, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country is under the control of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
“My government is strongly committed to reducing violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy to this goal.
Before he went up with the U.S. President, Pena Nieto served as the governor of his home state Mexico.
In this densely populated, widespread part of the country that surrounds the capital, the opinions about the new head of state are shared.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, you like to remember him, for example.
Residents of the resort write to him the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To get to the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto built and which represent a great improvement compared to the broken, hollow roads that there was here once.
Posters with its name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We expect real and continuous changes from him,” said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressional deputy for the party Pena Nietos, the PRI.
In particular, with regard to security and economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was dissolved by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera acknowledges that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party makes great expectations to Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition, the new president lack substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very engaged and has great plans for the country.
He is a great man, but above all he is someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this opinion about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the folded streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway transfers and in many ways represents a suburbs of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are of critical urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was engaged to fight the drug band operating in the districts, and violence against women is a acute problem.
On a piece of Brachland near a large waste warehouse, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left alone in the last two years.
During the term of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that even exceeds the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is famous for its violence and the murder of innocent women.
The critics of Pena Nietos are of the view that he has at least failed to address the issue of women’s murder during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government has closed his eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the falling neighborhood, Irinea Buendia fights with her tears when she shows me photos of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version of the events says Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her companion.
“When I arrived at her home, it seemed like her body was washed,” Senora Buendia remembers.
There were signs that she was hit, and the body star had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, from the wall a picture of Mariana looks down on us. It is attached next to a cross that carries one word: justice.
But this, so the family, has been denied to her so far.
The authorities have treated me as if I was a swimmer, an anxious, anxious.
They want you to simply accept their judgment and keep your mouth.
"But this is not possible if there were so many form errors and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the presidential bond on Saturday, he will also take a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been compassionate of violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has promised to take care of this issue especially during his term of office.
“I hope as president he is the way he was as governor,” says PRI congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But this is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Prosecutor: Bradley Manning has not complained of abuse
Prosecutor's office opposes Bradley Manning's accusations that he was abused in prison
The hearing addresses Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence seeks to reject the charges due to harsh detention conditions.
The U.S. Army is accused of wasting thousands of confidential documents.
The Prosecutor's Office on Friday tried to find that army friend Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest disclosure of confidential information in U.S. history - missed several occasions to complain about the alleged abuse he suffered in military detention.
During a Mannings cross hearing during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein said that documents on weekly visits carried out by prison officials during Mannings nine-month prison period in Quantico, Virginia, did not show any complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross hearings, which were held as a result of a defence request to reject the charges – Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the hard imprisonment period – Manning had said he had committed suicide in prison.
The U.S. military intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein and Manning completed the forms that officials had filled after their meetings with Manning during his detention in the Quantico Military Prison, where he had entered under strengthened detention conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fein questioned him on the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had considered the treatment by his guardians as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, so fine, did not contain any complaints about abuse, although officials had asked Manning directly for his treatment.
Manning replied that he expressed his concerns verbally and the officials had discussed them with him and said to deal with them.
"They wrote (after the meeting of concerns) 'No problems', and that didn't necessarily mean that I didn't say anything at all," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met in January 2011 with a committee to investigate the suicide thoughts he mentioned a few months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to lower his observatory status to “prevent injuries.”
The military said it has assigned him this restrictive status – one level below the risk of suicide – to his own and to the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was well and get rid of the observation status to prevent injuries (...) in order to a higher quality of life in my view," Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday about his arrest and displacement to Kuwait, where he was two months in prison before being transferred to the prison of the Marine Base Quantico in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he committed suicide in Kuwait and was once unconscious due to the heat.
Not being allowed to know what happens to him or in the outside world has been stressful.
“My world shrinked on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together,” Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I would die in that cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without company.
He only allowed a mattress, a roof, flip flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or just lie down.
He always had to sleep with light that penetrated into his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and watchers couldn’t see his face anymore, they woke him up so that he would turn back.
In January 2011, Manning’s lawyer formally appealed against Manning’s treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge Manning also questioned about an accusation he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he had to sleep a night naked in his cell in Quantico and stand naked before guards and other prisoners during a morning count.
Manning had said he had never had the opportunity to surround himself with his roof during this counting.
During the Friday interrogation, Manning said he had closed from an order of his guard that he should drop the roof with which he could have covered himself, but he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep naked last night and had previously tried to show a officer that he was not a danger for himself.
Manning told the officer he could have used the bond of his underhouses or his flip flops to hurt himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning said, his underwear, flip flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
Her lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account her port experiences and drastically reduce her detention extent if he is sentenced before the military court during his trial.
Defence has said Manning will confess himself guilty of minor crimes, while other accusations that are considered to be too extreme will be charged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend.The prosecutor's office is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning was detained in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners held under the highest security measures in Quantico.
The accusations against Manning include the benefit of the enemy, the illegal disclosure of intelligence information on the Internet, the transmission of national defense information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all accusations, he is threatened to life imprisonment.
The Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to blame the immigrants - they call them hard times in memory, he says
Navarrette believes Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a short trip to Mexico City, I had just passed through the hall and had arrived at the passport check when insecurity spread in me.
The signs refer to two waiting horns: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), the other for "Extranjeros" ("Extrangers").
I stood there for a few seconds, uncertain to which I should go.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexican" throughout my life.
A ethnic shortcut - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italians".
I later chose to be Mexican-American.
This was Mexico.
And in my grandfather’s home there was no need for cuts or bonds.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don’t have the vocabulary of a mother speaker, and my American accent I’m not going to get rid of either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the serpent for foreigners.
I thought about that moment this week when the future Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda included all the topics that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. it is a reason for Mexicans today with the same high probability to stay in Mexico instead of migrating to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block according to the European Union.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartel, even though he did not specify details about this.
Mexico’s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never miss a single thought of the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the country’s leadership under armor to leave them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be forgotten.
So as soon as a U.S. government official exercises even the mildest criticism of Mexico, you hear — in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country — complaints about how the Americans threaten the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma go on the path of war.
And yet the biggest challenge of Mexico is in fact in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentments?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our tribe a person - a parent or grandparent part - had no chance offered in Mexico and emigrated to the north.
And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - dark, unformed, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faith belongs to them.
Not to Mexico.
And although we may now live the American dream, have visited good schools and got good jobs, we should never forget that it is the American dream we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is sometimes possibly disappeared, but with regard to our loyalty, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial of a humiliating defeat and look down to us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our band to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families were not failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.
And then we would not now see ourselves caught behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States, but yet somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally migrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take it bad for them.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling of not belonging to either one or the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but it is not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there’s something that makes this relationship even more complicated: Some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational citizenship want to regain their connections to the diaspora.
They want to employ Mexican Americans as temporary "ambassadors" for Mexico, who represent their interests in the United States.
We must tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and make pressure on the political leadership to intensify their bonds with Mexico.
now .
That will not happen.
Too many injured feelings.
And in the light of the unfair income distribution, unreliable corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure if it is really a great country.
I am afraid that you will have to go through alone, friends.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to give the United States for the deal with Mexico a half a century ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans are grumbling about how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm .
Maybe we’re more Mexican than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The cessation of arms between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected foundation for peace.
Can there ever be persistent peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to throw such a hope in the foam.
In the middle of the usual debt allocations, countless buildings were placed in shuttle and ash, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time missiles were hit from Gaza near the Israeli metropolitan Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be caught in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these mistakes.
Maybe this will only lead to more blood vessels.
But there are reasons to assume that the deadly patts situation could finally find its end.
A war that is neither lost nor won.
At first glance, optimism in view of the current situation seems all other than appropriate.
Even though the ceasefire agreed on November 21 continues, this week’s struggles have strengthened the hard jets on both sides.
The leader of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, is claiming to have pulled the Israelis back, although its group itself had to experience great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are buried in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not yet managed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is winning in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have the time on their side.
Thus, as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends on its side.
Turkey, a reinforcing, regional power, once considered Israel’s closest Muslim ally, took part for Hamas – just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Congratulating Hamas supporters believe that Israel is forming an Islamic Half Moon - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has power, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamic prediction could stand before the collapse of Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt – the most populated and major Arab country – on the southern edge of Israel has sustainably changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the laicist Despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his collapse in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
On the contrary, the brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on people’s views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor that cannot be pulled out even by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, make a opposite conclusion.
Hamas is no longer a danger.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", has been able to prove itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while Israel will be able to sleep quietly.
From a diplomatic point of view, the United States is firmly staying on its position.Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest escalations of violence.
Israel has succeeded well in recent years, especially with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although missiles from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide attacks – not least thanks to the blocks that penetrate the West Bank and thus into the main part of a possible Palestinian state.
Netanyahu’s Likud party joined an even more fighting group before the January 22 election under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these behind-listed Palestinians also destroy and leave their own state?
If they actually had control over the West Jordan, would they not throw down missiles just like their counterparts in the Gaza Strip?
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in chess and punish if they dare to lift their heads.
Per the hardliners will be able to set up. But the Arab Spring could make them a bit through the bill.
Even if the Islamists who are now in power in Egypt and other countries have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defence state is greater than its four Arab neighbors together.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments restore their economy.
That the pragmatic President Mursi met with Barack Obama to a ceasefire could be a promising sign – and symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking widespread steps towards democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination – a powder foundation that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli occupied areas, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The oppression already undermines democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to withdraw Hamas in the Gaza Strip will continue to demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need an impulse from the outside.
The right answer is the one that is represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel resides areas for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the cessation of weapons will give more influence to the implementation of this solution.
Egypt now, together with Turkey and Qatar, has to stop the supply of weapons to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territory exchange and a joint Jerusalem.
External Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would have done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the upcoming application for the UN observer status.
Obama also has to contribute to moving Israel to negotiations.
During his first term, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House it seems as if he was also refused to participate.
But this is a regrettable, short-looking perspective.
The United States has a significant interest in a stable Middle East.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia's unified cigarette packaging laws come into force
Health warnings and sick body parts on neutral green packages that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world's first unified cigarette and tobacco packaging laws have entered into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colors with neutral, olive-green coatings, which are also printed with drastic images that show sick body parts and tobacco smoke infected babies and children.
Apart from the different health warnings and images, from next Saturday the only difference between the packages in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small letters, is.
Australia adopts the world’s strictest tobacco packaging regulations.
The Federal Government of Australia wants to remove young people from smoking by eliminating the glamourous image of tobacco consumption.
Research shows that people who have not started smoking at the age of 26 are 99% likely not to start smoking even after that.
"You can already see young children that they understand the message of trying to promote tobacco companies with their brand image," said Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek. she quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will only have a small impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby struggled hard against the laws.
Thus it was said that with the laws would favour the black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and easier accessible cigarettes.
“The laws will lead to serious, unintentional consequences,” says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer much larger amounts of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have incurred their business.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarette tuis and silicone locks for covering intolerable packaging has grown considerably since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco corporations failed two months ago at the Australian Supreme Court with their law enforcement.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units in wholesale stores and awaits new stocks.
This is a good business for us.
According to experts, the hake in the popularity of social media lies exactly in the population to which the plan is targeted.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from television advertising, it prohibits them to appear as sports sponsors and forced most traders to no longer interpret cigarettes in stores.
The Australian government has banned online advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
“Those who market tobacco and have only a small area left to promote their products don’t come around the internet,” says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has seen an increase in experience reports on brands written by “total normal people”.
You have to ask yourself the question: Is it just a private person who finds such great favour of Marlboro cigarettes that he even takes a video for it - or has a marketing agency to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws instead of marketing.
It has even gone so far to pay to Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to push the new regulations - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries operate greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be made in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has conducted talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was in 2001 the first country to require photographic warnings.
Currently, these have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Stronger laws are being adopted in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
A lot of Australian smokers are scary.
The pictures do not affect me.
I simply ignore them.
"You just take a chip and put the boxes away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box on which a photo with a mouth tumor is printed.
To be honest, there is only one reason why I would stop, and that’s my little girl.
James Yu, the operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in the center of Sydney, says that the unified packaging has made it difficult to fill his rails.
"Then I took an hour to order a delivery, now I need four," Yu says.
“The government would simply have forbidden cigarettes completely – then we would have told ourselves okay, that’s, we’re closing,” he added.
In a constantly electric world, it’s nice to be tired.
This Thanksgiving I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our aircraft crashed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another fighter.
So I had enough time to get some thoughts bored.
I don’t want to lie.
A half-day waiting at the airport for a flight is quite nervous - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts lead tiredness as something positive.
When it comes to them, it’s okay for us – and our children – to be tired occasionally.
This makes the brain forced to lose in interesting thoughts, which possibly promotes creativity.
And because most of us nowadays almost constantly look at the one or the other screen, the benefits of boredness no longer benefit us.
So should we welcome the tired with open arms?
and yes.
And no.
I will come back to that again.
Like many people, I’ve always assumed that tiredness is a relatively current phenomenon that has evolved with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see that.
“In fact, fatigue has a very long history,” he says.
The walls of Pompeii covers a Latin graffiti about boring, which dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define fatigue.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that fatigue has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that fatigue can be defined as the experience of “wishing to do a satisfying activity but not being able to do it.”
Lonelyness differs from apathy as a result that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
In apathy, there is no need to do anything.
The key experience of tiredness, he says, consists in a "disruption of the attention process, accompanied by bad mood and the feeling that the time is just slowly passing."
It can almost sound like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two conditions may be connected, bored people see the problem in their surroundings or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re boring, even if we just have difficulty focusing.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - in German for example: "The Untouched Mind: The Definition of Lonely Under the Aspect of Attention", which appeared in September in the magazine "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to a previous experiment in which participants listened to a band on which a person presented a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it at low noise, so it was hardly perceived, while the third group did not hear these noises at all.
The people who took the hardly heard TV said they felt more tired than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, they couldn't find any reason for this, and wrote their difficulties of tired.
When trying to focus on a difficult or challenging task, disturbance of attention can lead to tiredness, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurosciences at Guelph University in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you do a unique activity - "as searching for defective products on a factory support band, music can disrupt and help you not feel tired."
In fact, as he says, we now know that cracks and cracks, often interpreted as signs of boring, can even fight them by keeping people physically more attentive.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to walk around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit,” Professor Fenske said.
We all get bored at some point - my delayed flight, a delayed speaker, a tired film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a "scale to disappointment."
On the scale there are statements such as "Many things I have to do are repeated and monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys get bored more often than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - especially when it comes to the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But generally, teenagers are a fairly stressed crowd.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of older adults were tired in school and doing home tasks, while 23% said they were tired when they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents said they felt tired.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn’t know whether the percentage of fatigue has risen or decreased.
However, he is sure that “yours are feeling especially boring,” mainly because children and teenagers have no great influence on their daily course.
So back to my original question: Is fatigue healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it causes people to take extreme physical risks and fall into gambling or drugs to relieve them – that’s what studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors study the relationship between tiredness and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been exploring the topic for more than two decades.
“With fatigue, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something different,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn’t always know what to do best.
When you’re boring and you’re using this energy to play and cook guitar, you’re happy.
However, though television can give feelings of happiness in the short term, they disappear in the long term.
Whoever gives a iPad to his bored child can bring it away from boredness, but he has not learned to talk or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds, “self-control passes from one situation to the other.”
The child not only learns to talk, but also gets more self-control in other areas.
I don’t think we should celebrate tiredness.
We should not consider them too critical.
Instead, our goal should be to make us feel comfortable, even away from the constant activity and technology series.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“It sounds like we have to be bored more often, but boredness is the tortuous, inevitable desire to do something meaningful,” he says.
He believes that people in truth are only looking for a way to turn off and relax.
“In an environment where we are constantly over-stimulated, it’s hard to get busy when the noise is silent.”
There are no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law in Colorado.
The 19-year-old Community College student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in South East Colorado for a crime that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few fewer marijuana drops and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and a few friends were on a September day by car in Lamar near the border to Kansas when they were arrested.
After the police officer had found marijuana in the car, Orozco was invited for the possession of drugs and drug utilities - cavalier crimes, each provided with a penalty of $100 - and received a trial date.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is he one too?
In the uncertain weeks after the state's decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for its own use, the answer for hundreds of smaller drug deficits depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of irregularities surrounding marijuana are already being carried out here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities will no longer prosecute adults over 21 years of age for ownership in a small scale. this will be permitted by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced to continue to pursue existing marijuana attacks and still cite people before court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denvers to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana shops from opening in their municipalities.
"This situation is developing so quickly that I don't know what's going to happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
And the regulatory authorities in the state of Washington also crack on their heads.
They are waiting for guidance assistance to establish a license system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of drugs – and have a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado in any case is ahead of the majority of states as regards the regulation of marijuana. there the drug was legalized first for medical purposes and then for its own consumption.
"Colorado has a stronger regulated market. the state is therefore good for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Supervisory Authority for Alcohols in the state of Washington.
But Smith also acknowledges that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
“We don’t have a real precedence that we can follow,” he adds.
The Washington Act, called I-502, enters into force on December 6th and thus forms the endpoint of a gray zone in which the state license system does not exist yet, but the property is legalized.
And unpleasant practical questions need to be clarified at this time - for example, how the state provision of a "suitable access" to licensed marijuana should be agreed with the ban of cannabis stores around 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities.
“Nothing will be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in Seattle’s distribution area,” says Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the “Center for Legal Cannabis”, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an email to his employees in Aurora in which he stated that the prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller marijuana attacks in people over 21 years of age, and that the police "from now" will not seek punishment for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to comply with urban regulations on farmers of medical marijuana and will continue to pursue drug traders.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, district prosecutor Ken Buck has a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his authority would continue to track cases of marijuana deposits, mainly to move consumers to withdrawal.
At present, 119 people have to be charged for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana before the court, although many have also been charged for other crimes.
“Our authority has the duty to pursue infringements that were crimes at the time of the offence,” Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are multiplied even in places like the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the countryside, does not show adults for the possession of smaller amounts anymore.
District prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to let all existing ownership proceedings fall.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time to exercise the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the beginning that it would not be easy to match the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state promoted a deeper distinction among local officials with regard to the great green experiment.
District lawmakers are a “cultural barrier,” says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents the accused for marijuana attacks in court and acts on the site as a spokesman for the national organization for the reform of marijuana law.
“They’ve spent so much of their lives persecuting people for criminalization that they’re still unable to accept legalization,” he believes.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national patterns for drug legalization.
While spokesmen and officials are preparing for an age of legal sale, they are also nervously waiting for the federal government’s instructions, which will continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a crime.
Representatives of the Legalization Movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give up.
Despite several spectacular arrests by consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has mostly allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, the former drug policy adviser of the Obama government is the opinion that although criminal officials are likely not to enter the doors to capture smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to get on to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana transactions under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado don’t expect the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipalities approved moratoriums for new marijuana transactions, although these could only be opened in about a year.
Last week Montrose, a city in the West, decided a six-month ban, which is likely to be adopted next week.
“We don’t want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the council.
The municipality has voted against this legislation.
We focus on what the community has chosen and not on what the state has chosen.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was raped from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only today’s university students are attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had visited that university, which I once considered the greatest temple of knowledge in the world, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization – freedom of thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entrance to Worscester College at the end of the 1980s — where I had planned to study history — I had packed my baggage again and thus brought the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it was said that I would have gone because I had a problem with that commillions had sex in the neighboring room.
The author A. N. Wilson shelmially explained that I would have left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less fun.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran because I suffered systematic harassment and threats.
Not because of my unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I had been shaken for one reason—a reason that seemed so narrow and cruel in this alleged wing of lighting: My now-dead father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a major adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a advocate of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Well, according to recent reports, a new generation of students of moderate rights suffer under similar persecution.
The organized and increasing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week demanded the same equal protection that benefits gay, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College say they are “often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared unwanted” due to their political views.
They ask for a place in the Equality Committee of their college to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation was worsened by a recently broadcast documentation about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which described Tories as an excentric and neonazist.
It showed, among other things, Graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Oxford, who was driving in a Rolls-Royce and walked with a silver-colored dress and silver-obsessed footwear.
In other universities, conservative students say they are considered to be “sins for introducing higher scholarship fees.”
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: “There is a growing left-wing tendency in universities.
People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without having met at all.”
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a history student at Corpus Christi, who initiated the demand for greater protection, is the view that such a climate is "unpleasant."The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designated president of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford says she has observed a growing refusal among JCR members to students of moderate rights.
“This poses a danger to the intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members,” she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly scary 18-year-old I had arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the University had voted not to grant Margaret Thatcher – a former student – an honorary title due to higher education cuts.
The atmosphere would have even scared Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students meet and the tutors, I got a prediction of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the temptation of Tory students, but even participated in it with joy.
Political issues such as the mining strike, the privatization and the government’s rejection of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa found their way into the wooden spaces of the tutorial.
At my first of these events I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English.
“Miss Wyatt,” said the writer Harry Pitt, “please translate the first paragraph.”
I stumbled there.
Pitt was a small man with a face like from cooking, and quite hostile.
“Do Thatcher followers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?” he asked me.
The other students shaken.
Tears came up in my eyes.
"I suggest you take a few French hours in your leisure time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt told me.
I went back to my room with my head hanging.
That evening I sat alone at college at dinner when someone slightly touched me on my shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
Unfortunately it is what it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being Tory will be dismissed.
For me it’s bad enough, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it’s going to be worse for you.
The majority of Tory's first semesters show to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to show up.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs. Thatcher in all points.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A beginner in philosophy, politics and economics who ironicly visited the conservative Eton College said to me, “You’re the daughter of a fascist pig.”
You are polluted.
Other students shared their opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
“How do Tories have sex?” one asked me.
They fight each other, right?
I felt like homosexuals had to feel before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever succeed in living a normal life at the University of Oxford?
Could I meet the same-minded only after the fall of darkness?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that were before me turned before my spiritual eye into a fire of agitation and isolation.
The only tutor to openly recognize himself as Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history who had his seat at my college.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was advising Thatcher on foreign policy and writing words for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and minor, and denied it for his Marxist-Deterministic history perspective.
In 1997, he graduated from the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he said to me.
I started walking between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
I told my father I hate Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed unbeliever.
During his time in the 1940s all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said smallly.
Such a thing they would never do, not in my city of dreaming towers.
Even my communist friends always put perfect ways to the day.
His wet eyes suffered.
Give it all a chance.
I’m sure you’re just naked.
It would break my heart if you went.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory's supporters, had given up the pressure and dismissed his convictions.
During a tutorial the next week, in which another story author had seriously claimed that I was "a enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly spoke of shame, I admitted that my parents had undergone me a "brain wash" and called it "old trolls".
The relief lasted a short time.
It was my father who shot the last nail in my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I was hiding in my room, and after five minutes my witches gave up.
When they went, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Would you like to call me a laughing swallow.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer in an educational institution under such intimidation and evilness.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only raised 14 Tory's prime ministers, but is hiding behind a worthless reputation of equality and freedom of mind until today.
“Valentino attracts the elegance of famousness”
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which was opened this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital that is worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has been recognized by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a great retrospective for which more than 130 clothes of the Couture have been compiled, created by his "Maison" over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, which would not have been written without his distinguished clientel.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the sticky and remote world of the noble.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will still be seen until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most read aristocracy, starting from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trophy of his social rise from the modest fashion designer in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international Jetset.
Being in love with the noble doesn’t have to be a disadvantage.
"At least they don't put their cheeks out on your magnificent carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from pop music do," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all happy to be invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the former wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always attracted the elegance of fame.
Yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza in a dress of Valentino
Even the Argentine model Valeria Mazza doesn’t forget the modem maker’s charism.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went home to him for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
On every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music, one recognized and felt his influence.
“All invited people felt important and loved,” the “top model” remembers that their career began at the 1995 Haute Couture Week in Paris.
“He never comes out of fashion because his designs are artworks,” she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of disappointment, rather of mutual love.
He loves people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was transformed into a glorious and 60 meters long runway that suggests a roll exchange: the user takes the model's place and goes along the runway to admire a dreaming "audiance" that wears the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wears in "La Notte", or a mantle of wool and leather that belonged to Emperor Farah Diba.
In this audience from fashion pops radiate names such as the Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modemaker, 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentino is like the first love, “unforgettable.”
I can remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a t-shirt, a western type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift from him,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designers’ museums.
“I draw him to everyone because of his great love for the women and because he highlights our beauty,” the former Duke of Feria added.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and emphasize the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even the princess and speaker at the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can not forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his night clothes...
At the end of the 90s, it finally came.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the castle of my grandfather, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying rock and a draped upper part with a decolleté that makes his name honour.
“It was a dream that became true,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino doesn’t depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg preserves her fashion designer's evening clothes "with absolute care" because "a dress is not only a dress, but also the related memories."
The King of Fashion
The great final of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion designer called his neighbors) were necessary to make this elephant-colored silk dress with pearls, twelve different stickers and a four and a half-meter long sweat.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the professional press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, “the return to the customers of the top society.”
Found with the "savoir-être" of the elite for years, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honor, accumulates Garavani as many honors as each of the husbands of his clients.
“I’ve always noticed his refinement, his tranquility, his careful and perfect exterior,” says D’Arenberg.
I saw him last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He sat at the table of Count Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.
“He was immaculate; time leaves no traces on him.”
This is what a princess says.
The hardest job in the world: the human labor animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and their health at stake when they carry 70 kilograms of sulfur over the rough, stone roads.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who deserve their lives by picking sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he must climb down on the ground of his crater every day, where the fluid gas flowing from the earth is fixed in contact with the air.
After he broke out large steel stones that can weigh up to 70 kilograms in total, he carries them in two bamboo bodies on his shoulders through the scary steel paths.
Although it is only 250 meters to the peak of the volcano, which rises to an altitude of 2386 meters, the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to rise at the thyroid pace, keeping the balance and taking their steps carefully so that they do not rise and fall.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who fell down on the rocks of the Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Eurocents for every kilogram of sulfur they break down.
Coming up, they take the way between the tourists who photograph them like circus apes and run with the tired heavy curves three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has set a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters.
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who has since 1960 exploited the events in the volcano and (not to say better) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for each kilogram of sulfur.
That then sells it for every 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocent) to the petrochemical industry because this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of straw trees, fireworks articles, cosmetics, dynamites and even to bleach sugar.
“Because we normally carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each route,” Anto explains, who normally takes three routes a day.
For each route he takes three hours, after which he has completed it, but at the end of the day he then has 138,000 rupees (11,5 euros) together.
But what looks like a miserable salary for such an unhuman effort is the triple of what he would earn with the field work.
“The daily salary of the miners here, where the coffee farm is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high,” the carrier, who previously worked as a maurer on the tourist island of Bali, explains.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village, and that for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as the sweat: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hindu, and I brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing difficulty, often hustet and his eyes are irritated due to the toxic gas.
The 27-year-old Anto has been spending his life on the Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sweat has already left the first traces at him, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing difficulty, often hustet and his eyes are irritated due to the toxic gas from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
“I’m going to work here for another two years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French,” he promises in a more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but life-canned young man could work as a tourist guide, servant or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he carries out the work of a trail.
He shares a dirty wooden cottage with other carriers and stands up every morning at 2 p.m., because the sulphur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluely in darkness.
The shadow challenging, he climbs in the crater in the light of a small head lamp on his helmet, which he has bought for his own money.
Approximately 400 carriers on the crater floor charge the curves with sulphur on their shoulders.
Despite its great profits, the mining company has not mechanized the sulphur decay to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work on their own bill and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2,5 euros) supplement per camera that the guardians of this natural park together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human trajectory.
“This work is for the animals and not for humans,” says Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been working for three decades since leaving the school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue "so long as it can" because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even when the sulphur burns the neck and the eyes swallow, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners climb into the thick pillars that rise out of the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about severe diseases ... of course except the usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders that have shaped from the weight of the curve.
With the basket on his back, Unainik, at his 53 years of age, is only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks through a dragon path between the basin to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometers away.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano was my whole life,” Unainik explains, opening his mouth far, where some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elderly, with his 30 years of age, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty continues generation by generation in one of the hardest professions in the world: those who work as human burden bodies at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans blame them for having no children, on the career, the stress and the costs of property and child education.
“The population of Singapore must grow.”
I am a patriot husband, you are my patriot wife: let us fulfill our citizenship obligations and create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for minzbonbons, but yet – or just because – they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local speeches such as "Shipping will be a "bao" (Laib) in the oven to make yourself funny about the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which has drawn the video, preserves the hope that the advertising spot reaches in a fun way to pay attention to the problem.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfill their “national duty.”
This is something just for the internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
In reproduction, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that it was a topic we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot of things, such as the marketing of perfume with feromons or the organization of speed dating nights (fast flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why don’t we do something as creative as possible to address this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Whoever does not take this issue easily is the government of Singapore.
Every year, they spend $1,300 on policy actions to encourage citizens to get more children.
A government package for couples and parents gives up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservation of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to the National Population Authority, the birth rate is at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time that this rate was above 2, which is also known as the replacement rate, was in 1976.
So why don’t Singapore have children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities".
“This has made it possible for people to have significantly more options in relation to life goals and to set priorities in addition to marrying and forming a family,” she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to a higher number of single people and to the delay in marriage and birth, resulting in a decrease in birth rates in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration to counter the population decline led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where the hardly casched xenophobia flourishes against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese who are criticized for keeping their wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also considered as one of the reasons that the government party in Singapore last year achieved its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, a attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known effects on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to that not so many small homes are built.
This has already impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and allowed to be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyles of the single, and that they prevent construction firms from building large apartments for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Chief Executive Officer of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his shoe boxes can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold days and even weeks faster than the larger residential units.
This makes them much better for our cash flow.
However, he acknowledges that the new standards give developers clearer guidance, which had previously been put into the way of obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could prepare the way to a rise in national birth rate, the talks with the Singaporeans who work in the financial district will find that they will not have a great impact.
“People are strongly stressed, houses and education are expensive, so it’s pushed out by many,” a young manager says.
Children can get others.
“It’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another, about twenty-year-old man.
Men and women lead their career, stress and the cost of property and education as a reason they can’t have children.
That’s why Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to getting children – the government can still do so much.
Offline Private Offline is Online Private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, it is the property private or "the area of private life where you have the right to protection from any type of interference."
What is private for someone under 16 years old?
How is this definition applied to its daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he publishes on the Internet situations that he’t share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who frequently traveled online.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very personal" on a personal level and "to the password and the user" when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets I't disclose in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge trying to explain the meaning of "private" on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
“These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world,” he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
"I't share a picture that's not of me, or of someone who makes the fool," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to post obscure photos, of naked, of crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has on FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I logged in to Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if anyone answers me, I’m just loading them up,” he adds.
“Social networks are fun, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or with friends,” he says.
Asked, he replied that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone receives him a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of the 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teen has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he acknowledges not to know 20 of the people he has added to his friend list.
“It doesn’t scare me because we have something common, such as music,” he adds.
According to the boy, no one gave him any indications or asked him for his address or telephone number.
“If someone presses me or asks me, I’ll just remove him from my user account,” he adds.
José logged in to Ask after he had read a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unknown experience, which is known today as cyberbullying.
A friend of a friend was kidnapped in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who he was,” he said.
According to José, the victim has not closed the user account.
“He did it privately.”
After that, it explains a number of steps to configure a user account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or angry situations.
Yes, I would do that if he is unsympathic to me or I want to wash him out one.
“But I know this is cyberbullying,” he explains.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a graduate degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient the children and youth, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
“Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; with the appearance of these pages, the rules of the game have changed,” she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, the holder of a master's degree in education at Yale University and the author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
“We are the digital immigrants to teach them where we still learn,” he says.
He explains that it’s a complex topic, “because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what can be spread, published or said, and this in an age where maturity is not sufficient for it.”
“They should be volunteer even when it’s most important to them to be popular, have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is to ask them questions that make them think about.
“To tell them they should not do it doesn’t work,” he says.
Porras then calls some possibilities: There are things you’t tell a stranger.
Or: Would you like to post a photo of you like that you posted by a friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
Have you previously asked the other people for permission when you labeled photos of celebrations?
And another question: Should everyone know what you are doing at every moment?
Another point is to give them understanding that they have to trade online as they do it offline.
They are the same rules.
"Anyone outside the Internet acts with respect, sensitivity and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential that parents carefully read the social networks guidelines.
When they understand all sections, they have a solid foundation to talk to their children about the importance of opening one user account on the Internet.
“For example, the age, or what you can share or publish,” he explains.
According to Guardia, children must be reminded of the lesson "Do not talk to strangers".
The conclusion of the UNASUR summit without the publication of the statement of Lima
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and theoretically should be signed by the seven present rulers.
Efe repeatedly attempted to gain access to the document signed at the VI. Ordinary Meeting of the UNASUR State and Government Chiefs. sources in the State and Presidential Chancellor initially that they would deliver it after the closure, but then stated that it would be published on the Peruvian government’s website at a certain time.
When asked about the text, they said that the content was presented by Peru’s President Ollanta Humala in short statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information about the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, in the press room only the image of the presidential meeting was transmitted without sound with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulated among journalists was received by the press spokesman of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document that was spread during the day was the list of the participating presidents, which caused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from different national and international media who demanded more information.
After that, Peru’s Presidential Office sent the media an e-mail with the “final declaration” of the summit, but it was the declaration of Humala and not the official document to conclude the summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the Third Summit of South America-Arab States (ASPA), and even at this occasion, despite repressive invitation by the press, the so-called statement of Lima, which was previously announced, was not even published.
The official website of the ASPA can be convinced that the document was published last Tuesday.
During the two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities emphasized that the information systems would be available for journalists, but they greatly restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment by the Court of Justice of The Hague that would result in a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH, which begins on Monday in The Hague, in the process that Lima against Santiago initiated to listen to the playoffs of both sides.
“We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we are presenting to this International Court,” Humala said along with his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that adheres to international law, seeks peaceful settlements for disputes, concludes agreements and submits itself to the international courts,” Piñera added and greeted Humala with a handprint in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the IGH took place after Colombia, following a decision on the maritime border with Nicaragua, which it considered a serious mistake, had appealed against the Bogotá Agreement, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court.
The summit was attended by the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 after the resignation of his president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after lunchtime in Lima.
The head of state read the final document in which it that 16 decisions were made and the action lines for 31 projects between the South American countries were established over an investment amount of a total of $17 billion.
On the decisions he said that the countries of the Unasur "will take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, with which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He said that measures would be promoted to “boost cooperation in the fight against urban uncertainty and organized cross-country crime, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and the internet at low prices in all regions of South America and to act together and efficiently in case of natural disasters.”
With the crisis in Europe, “economic consolidation (in Latin America) should not take triumphing trails, but should serve to expand our production performance and show a better future to our peoples,” Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a series of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas ... and thus unite our countries and open up new forms of economy," the Peruvian president said in a statement.
Among these projects will be five Peruvians who are on the queraches of his territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which are intended to ensure better connection with Ecuador, although he did not give any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the election process in this country will serve for its reintroduction to the Union of South American Nations,” which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to be an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourhood relations was another aspect that was emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before the start of his participation in the regional meeting that he expected a meeting on Saturday in Mexico with his opponent of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to treat the maritime conflict with respect after an IGH judgment questioned by Bogotá.
“Maybe I’ll meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow,” Santos said.
“We will review all of these paths – they are not exclusive, and the deal with Nicaragua also makes negotiations with Nicaragua necessary,” he said.
“I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectful as possible,” Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the assumption of the country’s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Bloc’s Defence Ministers also met in advance to adopt the 2013 action plan to strengthen the dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of the UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional block.
“South America needs to learn in the integration of citizens,” says Rafael Correa
Ecuador President Rafael Correa confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the 6th Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) that took place in Lima, told state television in Peru that the Europeans "morded themselves in the Second World War and in other conflicts" and "today they are practically a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that promotes the member states of the Unasur.
“The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andes community; however, there are still reactionary sectors seeking a return to the past,” he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the reconstruction of the Organization of American States (OEA) with the proposal to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and to take into account those who have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach, never commit to anything, and in return, the South Americans always sign everything.
“It’s incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights has its headquarters in Washington and is funded by the United States,” he said as a reference to the political asylum Ecuador granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he would not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but had followed his "deep democratic values and views on human rights."
He added that at the time, there were "founded assumptions that Assange was delivered to a third country and would not comply with his procedure."
He also criticized the Swedish justice that asked him to undergo an interrogation on his territory for alleged sexual misconduct, while "Swedish jurisprudence allows this through a video conference that could have been conducted via the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa explained that there was a danger that Assange's health and mental condition would be damaged.
“Since he has been in our embassy, I have not spoken with him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight lungs problem, but not a serious problem,” he said.
However, there is the risk that he will suffer physical and mental damage because he is caught in a narrow room and cannot perform physical exercises outside.
“This would affect everyone’s health,” he added.
Correa said that the solution for the asylum that Assange was granted since June at the Embassy of Ecuador in London is the granting of a freedom with which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe.
We do not act with human rights, we do not apply this word for this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a series of procedures at various European courts,” he said.
“If the UK gives this free letter tomorrow, I think it’s done.”
And if Sweden asked Mr. Assange at the Ecuador Embassy in London or via Skype how the Swedish jurisprudence permits and was done in other cases, the problem was solved.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate is "the mediation, the evil intention and the lies that disrupted freedom of speech."
“The greatest enemies of the freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but the bad journalists who seek to win and persecute,” he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador would no longer be dominated by such journalists, nor by the banks, nor by the hegemonic and bourgeois countries, and assumed that in a re-election it would “deep the revolution to continue the way in this right direction.”
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the organization "must stay hard and not be allowed to carry out any opportunism and no legally disguised state strike" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which preferred the maritime state of Nicaragua to negotiate the maritime boundaries between the two countries, as "absolutely justified."
This judgment is currently not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be thoroughly treated so that you can overcome them and look forward.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the disputes on the sea border between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "It is right for Latin America to call international courts if both countries commit to accept the judgment, even if it falls very hard."
With regard to the possibility that he will appear as a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador to his third mandate in a row, he said that he "vises this opportunity with a lot of optimism and joy, although it sometimes falls very hard."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power personally has never interested me, but in such unfair circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to take that responsibility,” he said.
If I had to win, it would be my last period as president, after which I would withdraw from public life.
This also applies when we lose.
“This is decisive,” he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just talked to the Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he was traveling there for a planned, routine treatment and that he would be expected to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
“It does not mean a decline in President Chávez’s health,” he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state took part today in Lima at the 6th summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which was ended with the call for higher regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of a death due to AIDS is a too late detection today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the test was confirmed: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried to "debilitate" without noticeable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began informing himself about it; and this with such a commitment that he just celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), to which he arrived after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine at the beginning of the 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatments and more stigmatism.
At that time, even the director of an IMSS clinic refused to say goodbye, "because it led to a sack gas."
AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome even with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who don’t know anything about their disease and in whom the virus has already damaged and their immune system has exhausted, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the appearance of the first cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who takes treatment in time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, saying that this information was backed by a respected scientific publication in April of this year.
The specialist in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists have concluded that although AIDS is not a death sentence, the years of survival and quality of life will decrease from the degree of deterioration of the immune system of people at the beginning of treatment, and that those who are not drug-dependent will have greater chances: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years with a count of 500 CD4.
Simply said, the aforementioned statements mean that whoever gets the diagnosis HIV-positive at the age of 25, in this sense can “problemlessly become 75 years old as long as he is under control,” said the expert.
To be able to correctly arrange this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today is an average of 76 years.
Although the mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the annual report of ONUSIDA), it is still true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients registered in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco in 2011 255 people died, and until May this year there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to the antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
So why do people still die?
In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have had no supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that people come in a far advanced state because they do not know their infection state, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us when they already have an accompanying infection. to be able to influence global mortality, early diagnoses are required, so all people in need of this need to be offered massive detection tests."
This proposal is approved by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state AIDS prevention committee in Jalisco) and also patients such as Fabrizio, who made his test at a private laboratory, and this is for the only reason that it had made a friend of him who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had the Kaposi sarcoma (a cancer-like tumor), which is one of the common complications.
Everything is different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they’re going to die, and want to hear nothing.
“If I have to die, I’d rather break three times,” they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, do sports and take the medications.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I take care of my health and that of the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today as part of the World AIDS Day.
The earlier they know if they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His news is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the loading table
There are large holes between the health programs and the simple citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has accepted the issue of HIV.
And the most important is the prevention.
“The distribution of preservatives was actually increased; before they were given individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who have no access to a preservative,” he said.
Among the people at risk of new infections are young people.
"Why do you need it?" is a widespread spotting question from social workers, school orientation staff, pharmacy staff and healthcare system that young people don't want to expose, the correspondent said.
He proposed to reorient this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only be located behind the loading table, but in the output devices in public toilets of facilities that are frequently visited by young people.
The promiscuity should not be promoted.
They should not be paid for the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González replied to the question whether preservatives would be distributed under his administration.
“Sexuality doesn’t look like that; it’s best to bring the preservatives closer to those who already have a sexual activity,” he added.
Key information from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulated cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is nationally ranked 4th in new and accumulated cases of AIDS, and 13th in terms of HIV.
92% of infections occur through sex, 6% through blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who don’t know about it for each registered case.
After the Court of Appeal of the United States has confirmed a ruling that does not recognize the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group, which was achieved through a trade competition in Mexico, an unhealthy precedent case will be created for each national company with headquarters in the neighboring country that has payment problems.
So it could be said that the survival procedures of the companies that the Mexican laws allow in the country of the Stars and Stripes, contrary to international agreements, are not valid.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district of Texas leads to the fact that Mexican companies are unhelpfully exposed to the capture of their property outside the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door and door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States for three incoherences.
While the judge indicates the case that creditors must be subject to the U.S. bankruptcy law, the appeal court of the Fifth Circuit based in New Orleans first says that the main proceedings are the trade competition treated in Mexico.
The first point would mean that the international cooperation in the insolvency procedures of companies with a cross-country profile is unknown.
In fact, for this purpose, the Model Law of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law was created, using the American Law Institute as a simplifier.
Secondly, the judgment determines that without the votes of the companies after the recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy that the branches of Vitro had with their parent company, the necessary majority for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among the group companies have been confirmed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Competitions.
It is also true that after the withdrawal of the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who appealed against Vitro at the United States courts, i.e. the Geier funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote was 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is guilty for his difficult situation since 2008 in the framework of the great economic crisis in the United States that hit the country.
For this reason, the family González Sada appeals to the same Court of Appeal to ensure that the vote is made in the Plenum, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If it is not made, the Cerciorare appeal, which requires the review of the proceedings by a higher instance, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States, shall be filed.
The serious thing in this case is that the Court has dismissed a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court), which describes the procedure carried out by Vitro within the framework of the Law on Commercial Competition, and which notes that it had strictly respected the agreements signed by the two countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the Law on Bankruptcy of the United States.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country is subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-handed karambole: a blow for Vitro and for the land.
The general balance
After the announcements by the Mexican aviation trade unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of a fraudulent administration, several months failed, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Pilot Union) finally made progress.
The petition led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal proceedings against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is charged with disability of justice.
After that, the supervisory authority systematically refused to inform the main administration of the Republic about a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw 198 million pesos from the trust account F/589 of the Bank IXE on the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded.
At a weekend meeting at a Forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmental scientists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of the Processing Industry) has managed to unite the governors in the Southeast to resist the monumental institution, which partially destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all the threats of the industry.
ACTA is dead
Since the government has not fulfilled a request from the Senate to explain under which conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement known as the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute for Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were carried out, although the Senate had ignored the possibility because it regarded it as a violation of freedom of speech on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without prejudice to short-term liabilities, the homex building company brings stock certificates over 500 million pesos on the market.
The emission is the first of four equal emissions that promise a interest payment every 28 days.
Establishment of Competival
Compounded by the companies NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leading companies in information technology, a company group called Competival was founded whose target is the service market of the software cluster in Central and South America.
The corresponding investment is more than $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world basketball player, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, has been linked to basketball for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large spiritual collection of the history of the country’s basketball as Héctor “Hetin” Reyes.
Before he was bound to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether it was as a player of lower classes, player of the first national league, authorized and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball association.
“Thro my life I’ve put myself in basketball a lot, even several at the same time, when I was the President of the BSN, the Chief Executive Officer of the National Team and the President of the Federation in the 1990s,” Reyes recalled at a visit to Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his trusted wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball was my life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated and witnessed with photos and memories of his long career.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that remember his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-manager or club manager.
“These were my best years I’ve most because I’ve been part of eight Vaqueros Championships since 1967 whether it’s a manager, co-manager or coach.
It was a lot of fulfilling years, including the five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with a championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good manager," says Reyes.
I still know that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a trainer and worked at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, “I have a very strong and 2 m-sized player.
Do you want him?”
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the freelance specialist Raymond Gausse, who made himself a citizen and was one of our best donors.
I still know how he said that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would worry about another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was awarded to him, but already from a distance, because in 1988 he was already in the top of the association.
At that time, he planned to enjoy his performance and the performance of Mincy in the national team.
I still know when we won the first time in the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
After that came the 1990 World Cup, where we got the fourth place, what would actually be bronze if it wasn’t the Canadian judge who allowed us to repeat the last match for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you’ve ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as those who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favourite is the team of the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the U.S. team a battle like when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
At that team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and Piculín (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who in 1990 was unable to attend because of a knee injury.
A team that was not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great joy, was the one of the pre-Olympic tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the locked players because of the events at the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against any forecast.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
This was, without a doubt, Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín.
And this, without taking into account his career in the different leagues in which he has played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a series of good coaches such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arill’s work.
What do you think is the best you’ve achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 90s up to 17 teams in one season.
What remains to do to you?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their territory and first meet in the national playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today, children make unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the required training and courses for coaches, table officials and judges.
I am proud of that.
What do you do today?
I like to hear music, watch videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became famous worldwide for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a scrupulous, foolish and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnet J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the 1980s' Habgier, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved birthplace Dallas, where he again played the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry’s family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebration of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of her wife in the original and follow-up series, was with Hagman when he died at the Dallas hospital, her publisher Jeffrey Lane said.
He made joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived the life in full trains," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he admitted that he had drunk a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver and he was transplanted.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman was known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Disappointing Jeannie" of the NBC television station.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he encounters an attractive "dschinn" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live with him at home.
He was also actress of two comedies that were broadcast only a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His film works included critically well-rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his mastery interpretation of the charming hateful J.R., which made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain about the Ewing Clan and other figures around it was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The "Who Shoot on J.R.?" advertising speech would create the expectation for an episode full of emotions where Hagmann's figure was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were worn in betting houses.
The series reached a record of viewers at that time.
When the answer was announced in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers that turned "Dallas" into the second most viewed entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin who was the shooter of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had swallowed her and threatened to represent her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, irreversible man with a charismatic smile: a deceitful businessman and untrue husband who sought to let his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) bear.
“I know what to be on J.R.’s grave,” Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he has not won.
Victoria Principal, co-actor of the original series, reminded Hagman on Friday as a "enormous personality on and outside the screen."
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of fans in the world and remains in our hearts for us who had the luck to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just directed, the broadcaster.
From Warner or TNT there was no immediate explanation of how Hagmann's loss in the series would be treated.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage with lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck at the Theatre Scenes in New York in the early 1950s, after which he served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their residence.
In 2001 he titled “Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales About My Life.”
"I have not written anything I thought it could hurt someone or in any way hurt him," he told the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he set up for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help worried patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are coming and after," he said in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as, “Do not be afraid, it’s a bit uncomfortable the first time, but it’s going to go well.”
He also set up against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Start of the course that studies the "End of the World"
Each week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and keymes, and global warming.
Every semester, when the religious professor decided to hold a course about the end of the world, he knew that he had an unresistible angel hake: the end of the "long reverse count" of the Maya calendar on December 21, which many people believed it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what should expect him in the next two months: the devastating Hurricane Sandy, which some have called "Deudarmaggedon", as well as a growing conflict under the involvement of Israel, the place from which Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't notice that this will be the most apocalyptic semester that has ever been," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If someone analyzes what has happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that evil is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he’s not the only professor offering courses about the “end of the world” this semester, which should actually be the last in history.
In Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vacker teaches the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Each week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and keymes, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a particular human behavior.
If nuclear material comes into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and studied how they were compared to real life.
“I’ve tried to inform students about what’s possible, likely, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a vice professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course with the simple title "The End of the World".
"We don't take up 2012 so that we always keep the option to be able to re-stop the course in the event that the world doesn't fall down," Restall said.
Despite the "predictable collapse", students have to study, create projects and participate in graduate examinations.
In Penn State, the graduate examination is carried out in the evening of the Apocalypse, so students have no other chance than "to continue to work until the night where the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," Restall said about his course for high average students, which filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received e-mails from students asking if there were still places free.
Students, on their part, ensure that the course is among the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at Rutgers' Chamber of Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sectal or religious mentality is actually just a matter of comfort or its lack.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for Psychology and Nursing explains that he has seen all apocalyptic films.
“I’ve never heard anything about a class where this is taught,” he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the surveyed students - and less a professor - explained to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project addressed the prophecy of the Mayas, and in a certain way we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, a student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
However, he notes that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that leads several centuries back when people responded to changes in their surroundings with the prediction of the end of the world.
The internet has raised these speculations.
“Other places people don’t think that way,” he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religious professor at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question whether he would know a course about the “end of the world” there.
“The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher instance.
We have a compassion from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days were spoken by the last court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "the people immediately think of a new date" or philosophy that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world will come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said they wanted to go to celebrate about "the end of the world".
“Maybe I’m calling a few friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communication student.
