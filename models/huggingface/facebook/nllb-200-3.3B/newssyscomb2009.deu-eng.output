Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, 29% of the total
The early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday, according to the first preliminary results, brought a noticeable weakening of both parties in the previous grand coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly heavy losses, with the position of its former chairman, Wilhelm Molterer, seriously on the wane.
In contrast, the leader of the election campaign for the Bund for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Carinthian state governor Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, the Social Democrats (SPÖ) remain the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, but compared to the last elections in 2006 they lost 5.5 percent of the vote.
Even worse was the ÖVP, which lost almost nine percent of the vote at 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in Austria's post-war history, and especially for the People's Party, which had called for early elections, this is a truly catastrophic result.
In early July, when the ÖVP had left the coalition, the Volkspartei had a clear lead over the SPÖ.
But the voters probably punished the party for failing the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there was speculation about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party's executive committee.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the grand coalition of the SPÖ and the ÖVP.
The Social Democrats, however, expressed their fear that the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the FPÖ, which received 18 percent of the vote, and the BZÖ, 11 percent - could lead to a repeat of 1999, when the People's Party and the Populists (at that time the FPÖ were still united, but in 2005 they split from the BZÖ) reached agreements on a joint government, which even triggered sanctions from the European Union.
This is clearly the case for Jörg Haider, who has already declared that he is ready to work with any party and is assuming that he will return to Vienna to take part in Austrian federal politics.
The Greens also entered Parliament, but suffered slight losses and slipped from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably passed the four per cent threshold and therefore did not enter Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool
If the problem of Czech scientists who have been charged in India for illegal beetle harvesting is not resolved, this could lead to a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
The Minister stressed this in New York after his meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi today.
"If this is not cleared up, then there will be a certain cooling off", he said after a meeting held on the Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that it was difficult for the executive to intervene in judicial matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charges and fined, the central government wanted to cooperate with the local government in Dardjiling, whose jurisdiction the case falls under.
"His problem could be solved", said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherdshi believes that the best course of action would be to appeal to a higher court.
He could then apply for bail and await his sentencing in freedom, according to the Minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had made the same point during the negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be in question for him", said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole affair is to have the convicted man provided with 'competent legal support', the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance was already being provided by the Indian side.
'We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians admit this too", Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, he confirmed to his counterpart that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists, according to the Czech press agency ČTK.
"We really think it is a big mistake to arrest and prosecute these Czech scientists", he said.
The Minister gave no answer to the question whether he had received an undertaking from the Indian side to look into the matter.
"I have already been promised quite a lot", he simply stated.
A Czech judge on the struggle for the seabed
He approaches an electronic map of Australia and its surrounding seas.
But what he doesn't care about is the continent, but a tiny dot lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself", says Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who is part of the 30-strong team working for the UN Ocean Division.
His boss, the division director, the Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and adds to it from time to time.
It's a place of work and excitement.
The seabed is home to a little-known world rich in natural resources.
The oil, the ore and other non-renewable resources are found here, as well as previously unknown living organisms, which, for example, hold the key to developing a cancer drug.
A Sea of Ground Larger than the Land
The coastal states are now vehemently claiming the new sea areas.
The Commission is not prepared to accept the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.
This is especially true of the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends into the sea up to several hundred kilometers from the shore of a country.
This country has an exclusive claim to all sources of the continental shelf under the Convention.
"In simple terms, the continental shelf is the part of the ocean floor and its beds that is a natural continuation of the continent below the surface of the sea.
It crosses the borders of the shore, often including the 200-nautical-mile limit of the so-called exclusive economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission to determine the outer limits of the continental shelf must be supported by a substantial scientific and technical documentation, based on a large number of costly studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
'One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical support.
The Commission has so far been dealing with five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have been successful", adds Mikulka.
The success of Australia, the first country to significantly increase its sea areas, has recently received international attention.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the sea-floor expansion allowed by the Commission last week is about 1.6 million square kilometres, about six times the size of the country.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the research.
The future profits from the exploitation of the seabed will, they promise, be invaluable.
The Commission will also be presenting proposals for the new Member States.
They can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which the Convention calls the "common heritage of mankind".
No state will then have a special position in this area.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed is not a gold-digging country", says Director Mikulka, who is exaggerating, adding that "the individual areas are clearly defined by law and the system is enshrined in contracts".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other countries of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint organization 'Interoceanmetal'.
In 1991 it was granted the status of a 'trailblazing investor' under the Convention, as were the investors of a few other countries.
The organization has the right to mine in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is a kind of tatra on the seabed.
"It covers an area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", said another Indian jurist, Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the division, Rober Sandev, brings such a concrete as a sample.
It reminds us of a small potato or, with a little imagination, the fabulous shell that, according to legend, brought the golem to life.
German special forces were on the scene during the hostage rescue
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it got serious, the special forces were ready, but they didn't come.
More and more details are becoming known about the circumstances surrounding the release of eleven European tourists who were abducted in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
Accordingly, both specialists of the Bundeswehr and officials of the GSG 9, the Fliegerstaffel of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Police Office and logistics experts of the Technical Aid Service were at the place of liberation.
The German forces were not needed, however, as spokesmen for the ministries said on Monday evening, because the hostage takers let their prisoners run and fled when they detected signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian Government had accepted the aid offered by Germany in order to involve it as a support force on the spot.
"Fortunately, this did not happen", said a spokesman for the German Interior Ministry.
The group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and eight Egyptians had been abducted in southern Egypt on September 19.
After being kidnapped in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were dragged back and forth across the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers remained unclear until recently, as did the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The rescued people have arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were in the custody of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
Berlin initially had no information on when they would return to Germany.
According to the Bild newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out on an Air Force Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US House of Representatives rejects bailout package
The first chamber of the US Congress has narrowly missed a $700 billion bailout for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones was plunging.
The U.S. House of Representatives has voted 206 to 227 to reject the government's bailout of the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals by US President George W. Bush and leaders of both parties, there was no majority for the program to curb the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic move, the proponents had desperately tried to convince the critics that the $700 billion package was still a reality.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had called on the House to approve the plan, even though it was unpopular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet", he admitted.
Even as the vote was still underway, the Dow Jones fell more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason was investors' concerns that the government's bailout might fail.
He recovered just before the vote was due to close, only to crash again after the failure was publicised.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence in international financial markets.
The programme will require the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate to come into force.
Organisers are seeing increasing bookings
It looks like it's going to be a good winter for German tour operators:
The study found that bookings for the coming months increased significantly over the previous year - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic outlook, the desire of Germans to travel remains untroubled, according to a study.
In the case of winter season bookings, the travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in turnover compared with the same period last year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
The study by the market research institute GfK also shows that booking figures for the autumn months have already increased.
The turnover of travel agencies for October was around 11 percent compared with 2007, the DRV said.
The results are based on figures from GfK, which analyses booking data from 1200 German travel agencies on a monthly basis and extrapolates it to the overall market.
This includes travel bookings made up to the end of August 2008.
The weak dollar exchange rate has led to a particular demand for travel to the USA, the DRV said.
The increase in bookings here is about one-third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the local areas, are particularly popular destinations for Germans.
In particular, package holidays are highly in demand, said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising cost of energy and food, the costs are "more predictable to the customer than for individually organised holidays".
The Commission has also proposed to extend the scheme to cover the whole of the EU, including the EU's external borders.
The summer months were also very busy, so that a sales increase will be recorded compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres ski hits in the endless loop, beer from gallon jugs and celebrities in designer dresses.
A debut of the Wiesn.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She's blonde, a television hostess, and she wears a custom-made turtleneck.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing we have in common is that after only three minutes on the Wiesn, the photographers are already pounding on us and taking pictures of the memory cards - very flattering and that on my first visit to the Wiesn.
That's how you make friends.
The Billig-Dirndl seems to be doing its job.
As a resident of Wiesn-Touri and actually north of the White Wurst Equator, the well-being in the dress has been limited to date.
But once you get to the Theresienwiese, it's not so bad.
Almost everyone wears jeans or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - all perfectly normal.
Strange looks at the chocolate banana stand only reap my dirndl aprons.
A woman from Munich pointed out to me that I had tied the apron wrong: "Left hoast free, middle virgin, right forgiven, back wittwet".
I'm secretly going from the back to the left.
"Fits", he said, laughing.
Others take less pains to use subtle flirting techniques and wear simple hats with "To drunk to get dressed!" on them, stretching out their bare buttocks to an uninvited guest.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, comes from England and also attends the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He thinks it's gorgeous with a long "ooooo".
He tells me this after he has gotten rid of his previous dose of alcohol.
Right next to one of those fire hydrants that everyone thinks is a garbage can.
So Bob is one of those notorious "wildbies".
Others are not so fortunate as to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, the paramedics are running in droves across the fairgrounds to care for the poor Schlucker.
The nurses always work in packs - four at a time, hauling a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
It works like most Wiesn visitors: empty out, full back.
You can't see who's under the tarp in the Promille coffin.
"They are the ones who never catch anything", one of the paramedics called out to me and disappeared into the crowd.
The name of the victim of the accident was announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex has been released.
Carole Paulson, a resident of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Shenfield Road in the city centre on Friday afternoon.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving following the accident.
He's been released on bail since.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey aspired to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in penetrating deep into Turkey's hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps into Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavor.
Hydarpasha Railway Station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the tour guides tell you.
The building sits on a crumbling end of the platform with a tower at each corner of the front, making it look like some provincial German town hall.
The rocks are filthy.
The whole building is falling apart.
But once you're inside the vaulted ticket office, there's no doubt about the grandeur of the project, whose westernmost entrance was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolian-Baghdad Society.
Germany, a latecomer to the imperialist game, had to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond to what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialist ambitions were put to rest during the First World War.
His railroad was attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces withdrew from Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria .
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a munitions train blew up the ornate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly decayed, largely passed over by history.
Today, however, this railway serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and all east of it, highlighting Turkey's expansion of diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, created by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The policy of rapprochement is now in force.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the main features of this new foreign policy, I took the night train to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, Suat Kiniklioglu, a Turkish Member of Parliament.
The next morning, about eleven and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the old world pace in the famous documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered the new city for the new secular state project to turn its back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, which is known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity.
This has caused a lot of distrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the ACP headquarters, a purpose-built, state-of-the-art stone and steel structure in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-finished shopping malls and pubs where middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to close the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception", he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Nowadays, she has to look east and west at the same time.
It wouldn't be one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But surely Turkey could one day", I asked, "be forced to make a choice?"
"Turkey", he said, "did not want to face this decision".
He then made a point which almost everyone I spoke to here made almost routinely: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be that Europe as a whole can, in a metaphorical sense, travel east on the same railroad tracks towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasa station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German gentlemen, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched this structure being built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East might now, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey.
And as I was waiting at the dock for the ferry to take me back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At least at the time, there seemed little doubt as to which continent should claim this fascinating land.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (call back on September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he formed his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
It was designed for youths up to 21 years of age, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979, some of us were already in our late 20's - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape-shifter) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to attack any piece of music presented to it, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical diversity of such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, and was only possible because of the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for music, which never waned over the years.
How many times has death stopped us from "letting the music speak for itself"?
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants".
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never bossy but never excessive.
No matter how high the musical standard, he always demanded a higher one.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, when he was conductor of the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years or so, I've written reviews of over a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed by a single one -- often inspired by them.
Tod Handley was that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He abhorred conductors who, he said, simply "dealt with one or two of the world's best-known show-horses".
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your after-script to William Woodruff (September 25), you write that "he resumed teaching economic history at Oxford in 1946 and was awarded a Houblon-Norman Research Fellowship in 1950 ... while at the same time studying for a BSc, an MA and a PhD.
This is a conclusion from an author's remark in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 on a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the Universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for good and went to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino of the Faculty of Philology.
I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino Flamenco and life' because his black and white documentary photography is fantastic.
They drew my attention to them because of their simplicity and because of the power they radiate, how they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotion.
Resino knows how to find the magic moments.
Second round of the excellent sale at Honda.
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor had a large interior, this open-top saloon offers a much larger interior.
Add to this the technical details that make driving even more comfortable and fuel-saving.
Changes before the coming revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz is aesthetically similar to its predecessor, the changes made to this grand sedan are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new spatial flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are to be emphasized.
However, before you start analyzing the new model, it's important to say that this new jazz comes six years after the first generation was launched.
According to initial observations, Honda managed to renew this model for a shorter period of time than the other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales in the other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Jazz is the best-selling car of 2002 and again this year in 2008.
After the Jazz was introduced, about a million were sold in Japan alone.
The second largest market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase sales of the new Jazz model within the segment.
Thus, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 Jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates are 10 000 cars, which is 17% of the expected increase in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 Jazz models since 2002, representing 6,7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the managers of the Spanish branch expect to sell 2 000 Jazz models per year.
More specifically, the introduction of the new Honda Jazz model makes it possible to cover up the fall in sales in Spain.
In fact, the brand's executives hope to end the year with total sales of 22,000 models, which is 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain from the previous year (1.6%) to 1.8%.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% target in 2010.
To achieve this, Honda is relying on the emergence of a new model.
The Japanese company is hoping to sell some 200,000 of its five-door, 4.7-metre-long hybrid cars worldwide each year.
According to the market estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remainder is distributed in the Old Continent and Japan.
The market launch of the Insight is planned for the first months of the year, with the first public presentation in January in Valencia.
With the first generation, the new jazz is growing in all its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has increased by 5 centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, remains unchanged at five feet.
As the dimensions increase, so does the interior space.
This success is due to the new space flexibility programme and the central positioning of the fuel tank, a solution which was also used in the previous Jazz model.
The capacity of the boot with a double loading system is also up to 339 litres, which is 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation boot.
It should be noted that these measures are in place for the version with a 1.4 litre petrol engine, since the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2 litre petrol engine is 379 litres.
Other improvements, apart from the addition of additional equipment such as leather seats or the possibility of installing panoramic windows, include improved access to the seats.
The rear doors have an angle of 80 degrees, whereas the first Jazz had only 67 degrees.
The second generation of Jazz engines are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the gasoline engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high torque performance for the entire engine life.
The first 1.2 litre variant produces 90 hp at 6000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4900 rpm.
The gasoline engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
In terms of the predecessor engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has a 5.4 litre fuel consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
∀Auto-bean', which prevents collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan took inspiration from nature, more specifically from bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot that tracks the flight of bees in a swarm and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accidents prevention technologies.
Engineers from the technical development center of the Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the head of technology PR and R&D brand management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot is supposed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped flight space, very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But most importantly, the bee's multifaceted eyes, which can see in all directions at an angle of 300 degrees, allow it to fly undisturbed in its own airspace without interruption.
To simulate the all-round perspective, the engineers developed what is called the Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It detects obstacles up to two metres in front of the BR23C, within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor, which is immediately translated into a collision avoidance signal.
∀The moment it notices an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the flight of the bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at an angle of 90 degrees or more to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference from any other system is that this evasion is completely instinctive.
If it were not, the robot might not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,' explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobility Laboratory and the lead engineer on this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can neither move up or down, nor can it move across; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels, and not in infinite directions and in infinite ways, as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and deceleration functions to help the little robot avoid collisions.
∀This device only needs a few seconds every time to process the information and act on it.
It does not require to store either the information or the intuitive logic of the manoeuvres performed, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of storage space left.
This may sound surprising, but it's not about the gigabytes, and it's not even about the megabytes of storage.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology which Nissan proposes to introduce in the next ten years in production cars.
The robot is powered by lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future application of this technology could be to integrate the unit with a GPS navigation system via satellite to guide the vehicle to its destination and avoid obstacles in its path.
She's trembling before she's saddled with a mortgage.
You have to realize that the US Treasury, besides having enough liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis, and to avoid the US citizens getting involved in mortgage stories of supposedly solvent banks, an entertaining and informative game was developed for the Internet surfer: 'Bad Credit Hotel', it is called.
Or maybe the "bad credit hotel" or the "dirty hotel".
The third aspect of this accommodation, and especially its receptionist, is to think once, twice and up to three times whether it is the moment to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
I'm sure she has some useful information, but no details.
This is more of a site for teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, if a dream room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley is providing its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its business, making it the first bank in Japan to spend $9 billion, taking over 21% of its capital, a move that is due to a sharp fall in its stock market price.
One week after a tentative agreement was made public, the two banks announced that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's common stock at a uniform price of $25.25, bringing the total to $3 billion.
The price agreed is below 19% of the share price on August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will give it a profit of 10% and can be resold at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the worldwide transaction will be made on the basis of a uniform average price of $29 which is 28% above the current market value.
Morgan Stanley shares, however, fell 6.79% to $23.07 as of 5pm GMT.
'This strategic combination represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to a holding bank,' said John Mack, CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley took on this status last week, which should allow it to expand its business into new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Your association with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The terms of the deal, which were announced on Monday, also show that the deal has been modified in the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had simply stated that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
∀A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, managing director of MUFG, said in Tokyo, ∀we thought the holding would be all common shares.
But in the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and to hedge our position.'
On the basis of a weighted average price, MUFG will pay 7% below the market value of its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the deal will result in a reduction in earnings of about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares within one year if the latter are exchanged within a given period at more than 50% above the sales value, i.e. at approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable it to exploit investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its sales.
A spokesman for the group, however, refused to give details of the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should have a solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said that its balance sheet had been "significantly" reduced since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group, which has seen its stock price fall by half as the price of its insolvency insurance soars.
The price fell on Monday but remained high, at around 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other 'survivor' of the big Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that it had withdrawn $15 billion, part of it from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
The Republic must be rebuilt around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Hugo Chávez from Venezuela, Evo Morales from Bolivia and Rafael Correa from Ecuador.
It was the third party who, following the example of his peers and friends, put forward the plan for a new constitution for the election on Sunday.
The Commission has not yet completed its mission, because according to the public results, which amount to 80% of the votes cast, 64% voted 'yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted 'no', 7% of ballots were invalid and 0.7% were blank.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, a vote must be obtained by more than half of all the votes cast.
On Sunday, two exit polls and a counting by a non-governmental organization had predicted a clear victory for ∀Ja', with a 63% to 70% swing.
In the night of Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had claimed the victory of his constitutional project.
The European Union has also called for the adoption of a new international law on the protection of children against sexual exploitation.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect, and I hope that the Commission will take them up.
The vote, held in secret under the auspices of the Organization of American States (OAS), was on a 444-point text on the protection of the 'new socialism' for which the President is campaigning.
The draft Constitution transfers state power to the economy by giving it the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives largely on the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the foreign exchange that sends emigrants to the country.
The project, spearheaded by Correa, elected in 2006, also grants the head of state more extensive powers, allowing him to serve up to two consecutive four-year terms and the possibility of dissolving the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The constitution also guarantees the principle of free medical care and education, which the president has already begun to implement in this country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also intends to prohibit the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian base as a base for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages freed in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched an attack on the kidnappers of the 11 tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days earlier.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held captive in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon, safe and sound.
In the morning they were liberated by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
The hostages, who appeared to be in good health, arrived at the al-Maza military base, next to Cairo International Airport, by a special plane at about 3:30 p.m.
They were taken directly by helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, a foreign-resident neighborhood in Cairo, without being able to speak to the press, for examination.
They are all in 'best health' and no ransom has been paid to the kidnappers,' said Egypt's Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna on the tarmac.
After being captured on September 19 while on a four-wheel-drive safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, in the border area between Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was taken from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian woman - and eight Egyptians: two tour guides, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptus agency, which organised the safari.
An Egyptian security official said that 30 members of the special forces, from two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
'Shots were fired on both sides and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,' said the official, who wished to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of the Italian diplomatic service, Mr Franco Frattini, reported from Belgrade, where he is now, on the role played by Italian secret agents and special forces.
'We have to acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men from the intelligence service and the special forces,' he explained without giving further details.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve of the attack, the Sudanese army claimed to have stopped a vehicle carrying the kidnappers during a patrol, killing six of them, including the leader, who was from Chad, and arresting two others.
The army stated that it was linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Movement for the Liberation of the Sudan (SLA-U), which was immediately denied by the movement.
Letters - The Silent Majority of the Culture
A debate on the financing of culture is making headlines and is a central issue in the current election campaign.
The better.
But one area of our cultural life continues to be forgotten.
Who will stand up and denounce the miserable sums that are given to small museums, archives, archaeological digs or national historical sites that are miserably starving?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally significant buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no real laws to effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is providing 3.5 million euros for the restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley alone?
Our American neighbours have it written in their constitution that the protection of cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all representatives and all government departments, and that in a mutual agreement.
In Quebec, at the Association of Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers, gathered in 211 historical societies, are working hard to study history, to save the many private archives and to preserve the archaeological remains with a few coins.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, protesting with the force of despair when funders and decision-makers unleash their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalise parts of Fortis Bank
The Benelux countries are planning to partially nationalise the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has been in turmoil as a result of the US financial crisis. The three countries will put a total of EUR 11.2 billion at the disposal of the banking and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held high-level meetings over the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial crisis, which has been going on for a year, and therefore decisions now taken in connection with the Bank could be precedent-setting.
The decision taken on Sunday night is that all three states will buy their respective shares of the bank at about 49%.
The Bank is likely to sell some of its holdings, notably the insurance business acquired by the Dutch company ABN Amro last year.
Fortis shares started to fall sharply last week, and serious crisis scenarios were already emerging in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is too big to fail.
The institute's stock fell 12% on Friday to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of the stock has fallen by more than two-thirds.
At current share prices, the group's market value is EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic according to the management.
Management believes that the $700 billion American bailout and the resulting market uncertainty are to blame for the plunge in Fortis's shares.
On Monday, however, prices rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new CEO of the Bank.
The bank was also looking for a private buyer, but no interested party with a factual offer was found.
The Belgian government, however, was eager to reassure investors that they should not be afraid of their money.
So far, there has been no panic among the customers, and the bank's branches have not been raided.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but also calls leasing companies its own.
Fox in the henhouse
Because of a person's use of medication, life and health insurance companies in America often refuse to contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes which link the use of the drug data to the consent of the person concerned in every case.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we leave the chickens to the fox", says Richard Dick, who developed the program to track prescription data, according to the Washington Post.
Insurance companies set the fees and the amount of compensation in the event of damage depending on the health of the customer, and if the risk is overestimated, the insurance will not be taken out at all.
In the past, the customer was sent for a medical examination and the contract was concluded only after the results of the examination were known.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much more economical method: using the customer's identification number, he collects the last one and a half years' data from pharmacies, i.e. which preparations were bought, and the program calculates from this, what disease the customer suffers from and what his state of health is.
For example, if he regularly takes large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it would suggest that his blood fat levels are unmanageably high, which would automatically put him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the programme in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that the insurers only have to do more paperwork, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many drugs can be taken for different purposes, such as migraine and hot flashes, but also for depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the insurer's point of view, whereas the former is not.
For the collection and processing of data, companies have been formed which ask the patient for his consent before obtaining the data.
Now they are required by law to do so, although there has never been a penalty for failure to do so.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and combine them with data on the use of medication, thus providing a more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, and at the same time it is becoming more difficult to control how it is used.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect is limited to healthcare providers and insurance companies.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress, which would allow the authorities to control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard realizes that this is not enough, so he wants to further develop his program so that the data can only be shared with the consent of the person concerned.
Another issue, of course, is that the data subject can hardly deny access to his data, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are left to the mercy of the fox.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
As the European Union and India are each other's leading trade partners, this was the main theme of the ninth Summit, alongside other global issues.
The French-Indian summit is also being held today, and the main subject of discussion is cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
The European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power which should be given a greater voice and say in international affairs, but member states have so far been unable to agree on whether or not to support New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at all at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the European Council, the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, and the Chief Diplomat, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, and agreed to double trade to more than €100 billion over the next five years.
Given that trade between 2000 and 2007 increased from 25 to 55 billion, this is not even an ambitious target.
The Commission also considered that the agreement would not be compatible with the internal market if it were to be considered to be incompatible with the internal market.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The aim is to strike a balance in the current imbalance between the EU and India: while the Union is India's number one partner, New Delhi is only ranked ninth among EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global concerns.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and terrorism, were among the issues which both sides condemned most strongly, and the convening of a UN conference was also urged.
The Doha Round should also be completed, with both sides to blame for the failure.
The EU stressed that it was sticking to its energy and climate agenda, which means reducing emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India agreed, as did the proposal to reach some sort of global compromise at the next climate summit, to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050.
The increase in food prices should also be combated, and both sides support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, there are hopes of contracts worth EUR 20 billion for French firms to build nuclear reactors in India.
According to the Agency, the agreement is to be concluded for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
Over 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries to take part in the event, covering the 171,790 square metres of the fair and presenting more than 403,000 titles.
The Italian Government will be represented by the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, Maria Giro, during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented by the 264 square metre exhibition space "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the Room Structure in Hall 5.0 of the Book Fair, which will discuss figures, trends and perspectives on the publishing industry in Italy.
The data show that the importance of books by foreign authors is declining in the whole sector, but especially in the adult and youth sectors.
The small plane of billionaire Steve Fossett, which disappeared a year ago, was found
The small plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on a flight over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007, has been found.
The specimens were found on a high plateau at an altitude of 3,000 m, in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, no human remains were found inside the plane.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said at a news conference that the plane had been located and that a team had been sent to locate it, and that it was the plane that Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared.
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reported that a team was dispatched to identify the aircraft, the Bellanca 8kcab, a few hours after it was spotted. The aircraft was lost on 3 September 2007, after Fossett had taken off on a three-hour flight from Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, some of Fossett's personal effects were found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
The documents in question are two identification cards bearing the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
Fossett's search was abandoned a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire had earned a place in history by setting a long string of records.
In 2002, he became the first person to circumnavigate the globe in a hot-air balloon in the sixth attempt: a two-week solo flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without a stopover in an airplane.
Among his many records is a high-altitude flight of 15445 m above the Andes, but this with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A SUV that stands out from the conventional schemes for its original design and special lines, the expansive surface and its clear angles.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new life into the sector with this off-roader.
The unconventional characteristics of the SUV will also be reflected in the presentation of the GLK, which will be on display in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October.
The publicity campaign accompanying the new model will be a new one, a 3D campaign - a novelty in the automotive sector in Italy, which is still lagging behind.
The project is a high-volume effort which will be carried out in several phases, covering the central shopping mile of Milan, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will be the presentation of the car in shape, with 3D glasses distributed near Corso Como, which will give the whole a special look: the new Suv will appear as a three-dimensional model in its almost real dimensions.
In fact, the car will seem to stand out from the poster on which it is pictured.
The new glass is then illuminated in all its details at different times, using the Elumina8 technology, to be reassembled as a whole.
The aim of this advertisement is to introduce a new kind of car advertising into this rather stereotypical field.
But will it be enough to attract the interest of future buyers?
Now it's clear who the Italian hooligans are.
They come from the Triveneto  now they risk stadium ban
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls, of whom all of Italy is now ashamed, who are part of the Ultras Italia group, which has been following the Italian national team for years and, to be honest, has not caused any serious problems until recently?
We've never had a run-in with the opposing fans before.
The group has its origins in the right-wing milieu.
The promoters are from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
In addition to these, other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia were also present in Sofia.
They wear the tricolor flag, which shows the militants' cities, but they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was a clash with a truly radical right-wing fan scene, that of Levski.
The Figc had provided 144 cards to the Italian fans for the game, all of which were issued by name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: none of those who travelled to Sofia had a stadium ban pending.
Four Italian fans, who were already in a state of distress in this respect, were also denied tickets and travel to Bulgaria.
The Viminal is now waiting for the Bulgarian police to report on the incident and take further action: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi could be banned from the stadium for at least five years.
This is an international ban which prevents access to stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Thank God for that.
But now, of course, there is fear of copycat perpetrators, who could follow this one by a little more than 150.
"This fire must be extinguished immediately, and in no case give such behavior the opportunity to justify", it says from the Viminal.
Therefore, "keep your eyes on the game of the national team in Lecce on Wednesday".
Because in fact, in Apulia, there is a small nucleus of Italian Ultras.
The Osservatorio (Sports Authority) will meet tomorrow, and on Tuesday the Casms, which is part of the AISE, the secret services that deal with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce shouts and right arm raised during the hymn of Mameli?
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (to put it bluntly), who has been the director of the Viminal Observatory for a few weeks (he took over from Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Before that, Mazzilli was the police chief of Trieste, where a core of the supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, now come from.
While it is true, Mazzilli says, that praising the Duce is not against the law in Bulgaria, there is no doubt that the behavior of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist", adds the number one of the Observatory, "crimes are punished in the country of their crime.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council, and I am sure that it will do so.
But let us also speak of the whistling during the hymn Mamelis: even this is not a crime, but allow me, there is no education ... "
