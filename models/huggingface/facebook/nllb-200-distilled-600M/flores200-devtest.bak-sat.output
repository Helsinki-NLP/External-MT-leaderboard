Finally, there are many small cats (including homeless house cats), which eat far more of numerous small cats such as insects, rodents, birds and lizards.
The key to their success is the idea that every cat is a special job that doesn't allow them to compete with others.
The lions live in the most social cats, groups called praids.
Pryde is composed of one or three elderly brothers, as well as thirty grandmothers and children.

Lions handle their praid mostly like wolves or dogs, animals that are very lethal to the amazing lions (but not to other big cats) in terms of behavior, as well as their own profits.

The wildcat is a member of the panther family, along with the lion, the bear and the jaguar, which are capable of breaking apart.

Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if possible. Ocelots are much smaller than all other animals they hunt.

They have excellent night vision in the dark, and also walk very unconsciously. In combination with the environment, ocelots go hunting their prey, and then throw themselves into their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) separates from the original population from which they originate (for example, when they cross a mountain ridge or river, or when they move to a new island where returning is difficult), they often fall into a different environment than before.

The first populations were not fully adapted, they still needed to be adapted as before.
As the new nation began to adapt to their new environment, they began to look less like other nations.
Eventually, within a thousand or a million years, two peoples will be so different, they will not be the same.
The origin of species is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.

The North Atlantic Campaign of World War II. The Americans attempted to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
Although the German fleet, using mostly submarines, tried to stop this movement.
Allied defeats, Germany might have conquered Britain as well as the rest of Europe.

Ancient cultures and tribes began to cultivate them to facilitate the production of milk, wool, meat and skin.
House goats were mainly kept in herds, roamed on hills and other pastures, and were often kept by shepherds placed among children or youth, whose methods were similar to those of well-known shepherds.
Conca was first built in England in the 16th century.
Although conca consisted only of simple wooden boards laid parallel, it was slightly better than uneven roads, helping horses to accumulate higher speeds and carry larger loads.

The first way to move around was walking. Humans started walking around the time of Homo Erectus (right-walking man) two million years ago.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk straight as usual.
4,2  3,9 million years ago, amongst the fossilized remains of an Australopithecus, two-legged objects were found, although it is likely that salehantropes began to walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.

The main purpose of science is to discover how the world is constructed using a scientific method, which in fact provides a guiding principle for most scientific research.
The experiment is not the only method used to conduct experiments, but rather the experiment is the study used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions and to conduct observations, which also give direction to scientific research.
Naturalismus and philosophy focused on the classical texts, especially the Bible and the Latin texts.


Most of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are primarily influenced by internal cycles and their biological clockwork.

Depending on the type of mutation, mutations can lead to different results depending on the significance of the genetic material that the mutation originates, the participation or absence of embryonic line cells.
Mutations can only be passed on to the offspring when they appear in embryonic line cells, where mutations elsewhere lead to cell death or tumor formation.

transport flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one place to another and the interactions that arise between them.
Unfortunately, studying the traffic flow is very difficult, because it is impossible to predict the behavior of the driver with a hundred percent probability.
Fortunately, drivers often operate in a predetermined sequence; therefore, the movement flows also have a known sequence and can be approximated using mathematical methods.
Three important evaluations to better describe the flow of motion are the relationships between (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.

The first animals to fly were insects. Their ability to fly made them easier to escape from their enemies, making them more efficient at finding food and work.
Most insects have the ability to collect their wings along their backs.

Today there are only two insects that can't gather their wings on their backs  that are water-crawling with a needle.
