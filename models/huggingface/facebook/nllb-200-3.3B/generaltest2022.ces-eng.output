The big Czech flop is coming back.
Pavel French was called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goalie Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a rough patch in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 31-year-old Pilsen native will be on the bench and could soon be in goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Plzeň or Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
He took over halfway through the game against Vegas, and since then, the NHL has not been on the ice.
The incident occurred as the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one pole to the next.
"Pavel French will be out for approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury", he told the Denver Post in early October.
His return to NHL goaltending eventually extended for over two months.
On Sunday morning, American time, he was called from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he attributed 94.5% of the surgeries.
The outlaw of the ice hockey world wants to finally make a name for himself and prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
He had hip problems in his senior year, and he missed a single game in the shortened pandemic season.
In the NHL, Francis has caught 36 games, and his save percentage is 92.3%.
Charles puts Camille's veil on his Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen as their Christmas wish this year a family photograph taken during a trip to Jordan.
Prince Charles also released his wish, using a photograph of his wife Camille helping Camille put on the veil at the races.
The British news service BBC reported this on its website.
They send wishes to friends, colleagues, and the foundations they work with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is wearing a khaki-colored long summer dress, and Princess Charlotte has a dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing the same shorts and collared T-shirts as Princes George and Louis.
Who took the photograph, William and Kate didn't say, it's not even clear when it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed for a photograph of a Christmas wish on a pile of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country estate in Norfolk.
The image, which will serve as a Christmas wish, was also released by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, and his wife, Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them in June at the Ascot race.
Charles, wearing a cylinder on his head and a veil on his face, helps Camille put on her veil, a color-matched light dress.
Slavia promised Berbro a million for the title, but Tvrdík denied it.
Prague  Criminalists in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr had promised Prague's Slavie a million crowns for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed the server efotbal.cz about it, saying that he had access to part of the police files.
The chairman of the board of the club Jaroslav Tvrdík said that the red and white did not commit any corrupt act.
The server has published a transcript of police intercepts, in which Slavie is mainly represented by its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who last summer left the championship club.
According to the file, the former influential Red and White official was in frequent contact with both Berbr and the former sports director of the secondary league Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Forensics was reportedly working on information that Slavia Berbro had been promised a monetary reward for obtaining the title.
In 2019, the team SK Slavia Praha won the title in the first league.
The police department had knowledge that Roman (Berber) was to receive a promised million bribe from SK Slavia Prague officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to the forensic experts, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of Slavie Tvrdike.
The file doesn't show any more information on the server, whether the police are still looking into this information.
He denied any allegation of corrupt behavior.
In the years 2015 to 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never committed any illegal acts, we have not sought to influence the referees in violation of the rules of fair play and we have not provided any financial benefits to anyone in this regard", Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the last, among others, Nezmar unceremoniously insults some of the former players of Slavia Darkskinned and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing by referees was triggered by a police raid in several places, including the Prague headquarters of the FAČR, in mid-October last year.
The highest-ranking official in the case is Berbr, who no longer serves in any of the football positions.
In mid-January, like the former sports director, Vyshehrad Rogoz was released from detention.
Helicopters, tanks and BVP are the larping of the Cold War.
The guns will be new, but in principle of a worse type (artillery must come from an armored cabin and carry the cartridges by hand without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, moreover, it has already been possible to get rid of the Prague V3S even in the specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent, but at the end of the lease, transport- too small with short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types with no combat potential
Rockets - we don't have any (but we produce and export)
PVO: medium - Cold War, obsolete; short-range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
My place is right outside of town.
The river was being swallowed by the otters, and they were damaging the crops, so I sat there.
When I came, I saw a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I just sat there quietly and the guy didn't even notice me.
I was hoping he'd go before something came up, but of course, the fox was gone in a second.
I let her come within 40 yards before I decided to shoot.
Poor fisherman was about to shit himself, waving his brow all over the place, so I called him up and said it was a fox.
Before I got off the property, he was gone.
I mean, even a meadow can be a Prussian.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a combination of a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you'd probably be seen in the thermos that almost everyone has today.
So, for the sake of clarity, put your expensive things in your sleeping bag and you should be fine.
The Void versus the Ham.
The inside has gotten the respirators substantially cheaper than the health department.
The state responsible for the purchase and distribution of face masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns in recent weeks on their purchase.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during one day the amount of the respirator differed by hundreds of crowns.
Why have prices moved so dramatically?
Which authorities have been economical?
And why did others buy the rail?
Lenka Kabrhel is speaking with the editor of the iRadio server, Dominika Kubištová.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I'm not affected by the memories of the ČSLA that the older generation lost), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have a large stockpile of technology that trained people can take, we don't even have modern technology for existing professionals, and modern technology is getting more and more complex, so the skills of the backers will be rapidly diminishing over time.
Besides, the modern conventional conflicts, where you can deploy them, will be very fast, there will be no time to retrain someone.
And finally, the reservists/territorial defense is of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where the mass guerrilla is a must and an absolute necessity to deter the enemy.
The only way to fight on Czech territory is to fight a conflict of such a scale and intensity that the guerrillas are irrelevant, and we don't even have the geography to do that.
We don't have any individual skills.
That's not even the worst part.
The worst part is half of them act like they have it.
And then you get to a situation where you see a guy who missed an empty goal two minutes ago, go into the attack between two or even three Swiss and you think, "What do you think is going to happen now?"
Well, of course they'll take him like an average taxpayer.
This whole "cut the quarterback" situation is so terrible that I find myself honestly surprised to see our quarterback beating one of the other players.
The first swallows
The COVID-19 pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major changes in the coming weeks.
The hospital outbreaks are expected to last for a while, and the pandemic equation has been added to by a new unknown: the Omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently dominant Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more severe course, as vaccine or post-infection immunity acquired through previous disease transmission helps against it.
But this week, the covid equation also saw an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side: the possibility of a cure.
A new drug, molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization by one-third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should be joined by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which has reported an 85-percent success rate so far.
The first shipments of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, however, besides hopes of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how prepared the administration is for the coming drugs.
As mentioned, Merck's molnupiravir will be the first to be delivered to domestic patients.
The company was also named first on the list because the drug had been in development long before the current pandemic broke out, with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for viral diseases in horses on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and don't share their opinions openly.
Eastern Europeans, and especially we Czechs, are used to saying "how our beaks grew".
You know, you do a survey where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people would say no.
In the West, they tell you how they love migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist shit.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They're afraid of the cancel culture, saying this in public means losing their jobs and a media lynch.
Then it looks good in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they're gonna find out what people really think.
Only in France, Le Pen and Zemmour, both over 20% according to the poll.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical.
Identical because of the rotation of the units, so that the soldiers don't have to learn where everything is again, so all the objects are exactly the same.
One is the Brda Atom Museum and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is, the USSR didn't want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for safety reasons or because of the speed of deployment of the warheads due to the more westerly location.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple) only the heads were stored, not the whole rocket, as they say.
If this weapon was needed, a special unit would come and pick up the warhead and mount it on some kind of carrier.
Apart from the museum maple, the rest are in a desolate state.
In second grade, we had a gypsy classmate, we were together for four years.
He was pretty cool, he made good jokes, he was a little too outspoken, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone talked to him, he went often and wanted to explain something, he was missing a little, he went regularly, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks, or phones, he went naked.
He went to school in the country, did some monkey business, but he was all right, never a screw-up.
In the eighth or ninth grade, the siblings, the gypsies, entered the same class, different classes.
In short, they beat the teacher, they had police on the scene, they threatened and threatened the other students.
I sell things for advertising (old things, things I don't need, etc.) and I've sold to Gypsies, they always had money, they didn't try to pull me over on the price, communication was calm.
I even sold the car like that, the guy called a month later and said he'd already signed it over.
I say to myself that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or something else as long as they behave as they belong in a decent society (works, works, doesn't beat women, just normal behavior).
But if someone comes, reaches out, empties apartments and houses, has nothing but mess around him, makes trouble... so it doesn't matter what color he is, but I'll be fine.
I have no problem with African migrants, as long as they get involved, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily English, at least), respect our culture.
I don't care if they believe in Allah, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll be theirs.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachatice.
'The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and despite resuscitation care, unfortunately she succumbed to her injuries on the spot,' said Zuzana Fajtlová, spokeswoman for the South Bohemian Medical Rescue Service.
The driver who was carrying the girl is believed to have caused the accident.
The 18-year-old driver of a Peugeot probably drove from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and for reasons not yet known, turned in the opposite direction.
After a collision with a Skoda Octavia, a Peugeot ended up on the roof off the road, described the accident spokesman for the South Bohemian Police, Stepanka Schwarz.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
It was a multiple injury and he was left trapped in the car.
After his release, he had to be given acute pre-hospital care and was airlifted to a hospital in the Czech Republic in a stable condition, said the rescue worker Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply for non-EU packages, often customers do not provide details
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He's mostly collectible cards.
"It's usually tens of dollars, say $10 or more, where it's still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free", the collector said.
Since October, he's had a slight increase in small shipments, has to add VAT and has to submit customs clearance data to the post office.
He gets an e-mail saying that customs is expecting a package.
Then, simply fill in the details of the consignment and, if the VAT has not been included by the trader at the time of sale, the customs office will charge it from the total amount of the consignment and the transport.
Where the consignee does not effect the customs procedure himself, the amount of the fee to be paid by the carrier must also be added to the total.
According to Lukas Neuheisel, the process is not complicated.
I click one or two check boxes, I insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
Because of new customs regulations, the daily number of international mail received in Prague has fallen from 60,000 to 15,000.
In addition, according to Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to calls for information necessary to complete the customs procedure.
There are 30,000 international mail orders that we have to process.
If people filled in all the information they needed, and filled it in on time, we would be about halfway there, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Addressing inflation
See the headline, how would you propose to solve the current inflation?
We're at 9.9% inflation right now and expecting more.
What do you think the state should do to slow or even offset this growth?
We see in Poland, for example, a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is that the way forward for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what's inevitable with where this is going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, I think it's inevitable that people will not be able to afford the basic things, especially energy.
How much did you get added to (who's the employee)?
I've been grossed 2% this year, which is ridiculous, but fortunately, I have a similar income from a business I run while employed.
Would someone be able to explain to me why proven convicted rapists are sent to jail for as little as six months?
I just can't get my head around how a court can send an animal like that to jail for six months just to do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for years, negatively affecting her sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention that a rape victim may never recover from it either.
Wouldn't that discourage potential future rape victims from reporting it?
The Man from the Tomb burned his girlfriend from the Bonecrush.
The man from Hrob inadvertently helped the guards to apprehend his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, who had been issued a warrant for her arrest.
He called them to him.
He went around the bend.
First, he approached a passerby and concocted a story that he had been robbed.
The officers arrived at the scene after a 911 call, and were surprised when the alleged thief told them he had made it up to get the officers to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to get advice from the guards on how to report to the Police of the Czech Republic.
Checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers discovered that the woman was on a national wanted list and a warrant had been issued for her arrest.
The case is therefore being handled by the CFI.
A sincere question for the people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I personally think that the Slavs are no longer ethnically or culturally related, but I'd like to hear your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with the meme, it's a pity that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague USA:')
Of course, I'm not denying that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's a question of whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially be beneficial.
I wouldn't consider such a case a true faith case.
I can't agree with Pascal here, but I estimate, if I'm not mistaken, that there are about 10,000 different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should a person choose?
I would say it's quite likely that in any of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you severely if you believe in another god.
And yet, in the tenth, it says that there is no God but Yahweh.
Wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god at all, than to risk choosing the wrong god out of a thousand, and the one true god that I just missed will send me to hell or some such place?
Other: Voluntary training followed by reserve enlistment.
The Swiss model is similar, I suspect.
X months of training (in different specialisations, X months in one) and under the guidance of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a pro offer.
All the ACR's could use something like this.
It could be done in conjunction with the Defense University.
We can say this: There's a constant failure of cooperation between the education sector and industry, companies are hunting in schools, and there's a kind of merger, where the workforce migrates from the education institutions to the work relations.
Not just when we're growing up, but this process is happening all the time, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, and so on.
A similar interlocking should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that the Russians, Germans or Mongols will never come here again.
It's funny how you think NATO is a stone wall, we have allies, and they'll defend us if we get in trouble.
Well, you're welcome to it.
All it takes is one election in the U.S. to blow their budget and the whole of NATO goes to shit.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas and the Poles have already shown once that they can just turn their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that will function as a guarantee of independence in the long run is an army armed to the teeth and a population that knows how to control the military technology of its time.
And these days, every teenager can pilot a remote-controlled device, so what's the big deal?
We don't need border fortifications, which sucks these days, but a horny teenager with a remote control can handle it.
How to Avoid Drowning in a Box Tsunami
You unwrap your presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're home with boxes and stuffing?
This waste is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
So a map of the shops that welcome your used boxes has been created.
And it's not just about Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a pity to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard, plastic or paper boxes to the participating store (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains up to 150 of them) by arrangement.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue bins.
The shops themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, and the money saved, as the carton has risen in price by 50% in recent times.
In the eyes of environmentally conscious consumers, it also strengthens my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-drug and eco-cosmetics.
The boxes and filling material are delivered to us in Popůvek near Brno by individuals who collect them at home, but we also receive messages from companies with whom we have arranged regular deliveries of the cartons.
We'll use it all to pack pack up our e-shop.
We are creating a more caring world together, thanks to individuals and businesses.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušniková from Tierra.
However, the www.KAMsNIM.cz app does not only show the collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a locator if you need to dispose of anything (where to take your sorted household waste, where to return expired medicines, tyres, used electrical equipment, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All the garbage can end up in the right place, plus recyclable stuff can find its second home.
The project map already contains over 100,000 such sites.
Gradually, collection yards, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places are being added to help find uses for things that would otherwise become waste, adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the association "Clear up the Czech Republic".
I'm more concerned that technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use computers or phones play games on them, but they don't learn the basic computer skills.
Recently, a problem has arisen (mainly in English articles) that college students do not understand the principle of files on computers.
Because Google Photos or Apple's photo app or actually cell phones in general just hide the underlying file system with the folders and dump everything on one screen in the app.
They can use the technique from childhood, but they have to learn something.
Let's rewrite history, really
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French presidency of the EU  beginning in January  last weekend and it was magnificent.
Macron spoke for over an hour, revealing the logo of the presidency, calling for the protection of Europeans  at work, on the street  and mentioning so many actions that they cannot be reached in six months.
But that's the way French politicians like it, and that's the way the voters like it.
Macron's supporters of the split between right and left agree on the small stuff, but they agree on Europe.
And in France, there will be a new election for the head of state in April.
The election calendar has also affected priorities.
The French leader said that historians should write 'the history of Europe' and that France was ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
Many commentators immediately criticized Macron for being a pro-European propagandist and rewriting history.
In fact, it's more like they're trying to prevent history from being rewritten.
Right-wing candidate for the French presidency, Éric Zemmour, is now touring France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is quite successful with the French.
Let's take Macron's idea for a history textbook seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't that be necessary?
Students in European countries are taught history as a story of us versus them, and never as a story of the whole.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs, they're all figuring out who defeated who in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they'll never know what the larger context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Miši" did not win.
The story, which goes back to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, also won best director and best actress awards for Jasna Duricic.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he held on to the first few places in the audience rankings.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film The Father.
I'm not too young, I'm not too healthy, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like having the flu/being sick. I had diarrhea for a couple of days and didn't really feel like smoking...
It was worse than the common flu.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying that everyone is.)
Christmas book tips
The Christmas number, which will be published on December 20, will include the traditional literary appendix.
And along with it, cultural tips.
We're adding these books to this digital edition for you subscribers to have enough time to get your hands on some books as Christmas gifts.
Prosaic texts that follow on from the previous similar collection of Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another portion of observing the world and describing ordinary things with extraordinary poetic acuity, depth and atmosphere.
In his second prose, photographer Šesták tried to capture the essence of both small towns and Czech society.
A tale of a return to the roots that turns out to be a long-sought illusion.
The goddess and the fairy-tale artist bring the tale of the Red Squirrel to the backdrop of a contemporary village.
Her delivery of brutality overpowers the folk version and graduates into a horror of emotional emptiness.
And that the road back to instincts is shorter than one is willing to admit.
In his penultimate novel, the author tells a much less sentimental story of return from exile than we are used to hearing.
Those who stay and those who leave know too little about each other to make it worth living together.
Trains start running on a new timetable, some carriers change
From Sunday, trains will start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some routes, for example between Usti nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts to run instead of České dráhy.
For most lines, the departure time is only adjusted, or their route is slightly adjusted.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The ticket sales started during the autumn.
The Czech Railways plan to operate an average of 6783 passenger connections per day in the new timetable, of which 478 long-distance trains will be operated on average per day.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers during the new timetable.
In addition to national routes, the new timetable will also extend to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company will be deploying dozens of new trains with the new timetable.
The main innovation will be InterJet trains, which will run on the Prague-Cheb route.
The new trains will be delivered to the northern Moravia or the western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
Railways take inflation into account in their fares each year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry on the R23 line from Ústí nad Labem  Mělník  Nymburk  Kolín.
The carrier here will replace the Czech Railways after success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 services per day, eight in each direction.
Further changes concern long-distance services between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express maintained its 16 routes, two return routes to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Kraków.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to maintain the travel times of its long-distance trains as similar as possible despite the planned work.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva and other carriers should continue.
The carrier will also be changed on some regional lines.
Changes await passengers, for example, in Českolipsko, where on the line from Mladá Boleslav through Česká Lípa to Rumburek, instead of Český dráh, Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run.
Passengers will also be able to use the single railway fare for a second year.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2%.
I have to disagree.
Can't we learn the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how hard they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work, they died.
I've never heard a lecture from the perspective of the slave party or the time, nobody defends this, only condemns.
What they don't tell you in school is that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves and that blacks were often the worst slave owners.
No one teaches you in school that the colonists often bought land from the Indians, they just tell you how brutally we Europeans slaughtered them, and slaughtered each other a long time ago.
I also spent some time in the United States, directly in schools, both northern and southern schools.
I have not encountered anyone intentionally suppressing the facts, but I have heard this happen before and I think it is a problem, I do not deny it (for example, in Japan, the atrocities of WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History is not concerned with one's feelings, it is simply what it is, and I think it is a fatal mistake to judge without looking at the facts of the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never do it again.
By the way, speaking of the Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slave owners are quite popular there, but on the other hand, they had some good successes, too, and I found it absurd to dismiss them.
And the North wasn't much better, as many people idealize it today.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slaveholder, and a lot of things were against them, too.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, they lie and manipulate, and maybe our point of view doesn't exist for them (there was a video on YT where they cut someone out of the TV who started talking about our legionaries and 1968).
What I found ridiculous about the US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I found that at some universities, it was terrible, these students were quite radicalized and the schools were very supportive of that.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older, I feel a little bit bad that this could be the voice of the majority, because it's among the young and even in the ruling elite.
I feel like maybe feminism has already reached its goal and it's not about the same anymore, it's been radicalized.
Now, in the present day, the feminists are people who have nothing to do with it, who ignore the basic biological fact, and other groups like LGBT, and it leads to radicalization on the other side, and it often leads to resistance to even the most reasonable things.
Besides, the more radical a person is, the more they're heard.
Anyway, to conclude, I've also never encountered anyone condemning colonialism or slavery.
I've had a bad geography, but it was mutual:D
Not because I don't like it, but because I think it's completely pointless.
I'm supposed to be proud of something I didn't do myself?
Moreover, I find the concept of nationality as a whole to be superfluous in terms of any personal identity.
If anything, I'm more connected to people by interests, worldviews and shared experiences than by where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and one Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a very nice guy, he preaches more about theology than politics, but then he always screws up some shit about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed of.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in fact they are born of the Catholic Modern and are in fact Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic but go to services with the Hussites because it's very similar theologically, but the members are generally more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanical Street.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michael in the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans, and even there, every Sunday at 3:00 p.m., they hold Masses in Latin, as they did before Vatican II.
The flame of Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav  The flame lit in Bethlehem, where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts did not go to Vienna this time, but this morning they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the border crossing Reintal  Břeclav.
They took him at the border last year.
The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that my platoon and I participate in every year, and I look forward to it.
It is an honour for me to have been selected, said Amálie Budíková, a scout, to the press.
Whereas last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal  Břeclav crossing in the car park.
Usually for him, the scouts take the train to Vienna.
Nothing changes in the distribution of flamingos in the Czech Republic.
With the Bethlehem Light, the Scouts traditionally first set off by train to Brno, where they hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrlem.
The next light distribution will be made by Scout couriers on Saturday, December 18, traveling by select express and passenger trains.
The light is taken over by local scouts or volunteers at the stations, who then continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic and beyond where the railways do not lead.
This year, the Scouts must adhere to the current coronavirus precautions.
It's the same as last year.
We recommend both these courier teams and the organizers of local events to wear masks, try to keep the distances as small as possible, not to sing to colleagues, just behave in a way that is as safe as possible, described the spokeswoman of the Bethlehem light Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem Light travelling through Europe was born in Austria in 1986.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace with the flame.
The light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope for believers, a light that overcomes the darkness.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event is supported by hundreds of volunteers, and the flame is also a symbol of altruism and human reciprocity.
All the news, including a list of places where people can go for fireworks, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economics background, so I don't know the fundamentals of economics that would say that subsidies are the cancer of economics, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
Infrastructure development, ecology (e.g. water conservation), health and education all use the money appropriately, I just don't understand why the money is going to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - a useless product is produced and this undermines the free market and the "natural life of the firm".
I myself work in a factory where there are millions of XYY-funded/co-funded XYYY-project-funded billboards in the hallways, and that company is just kept alive artificially.
This is not supporting a company that gives jobs to x people, this is holding back development when this company is holding on and taking jobs from companies that could grow and be more productive after it's gone
I totally agree, it's awful.
Sometimes even a person born in the Internet age will fall for a trick or a trap - especially advertising.
I don't think that I'm affected by the Internet advertising, but then I realize that it's also affected me - it's just so sophisticated that you can't always avoid it.
For this reason, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who want to ban programmatic advertising altogether...
It's all crap, in the classic sense of the word - I'd ban the Internet.
I have a feeling this is rooted in (but mostly in point 1):
"I'm not going to believe in something that the majority of people believe and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe in something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion that I claim is critical thinking".

TV has lost the Christmas movie trend, with two hundred premiering this year.
Los Angeles  Cinemas, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen behind the Christmas movie trend, with a record-breaking more than two hundred films premiering this year.
It was calculated by the operator of the IMDb movie database.
The family and romantic Christmas genre has been gaining popularity and viewership in recent years, and more and more of these films are being made.
This year, four times as many Christmas movies were made as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
IMDb has only included those movies that have the word "Christmas" in their titles, so there are actually many more holiday movies.
The movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are associated with this period, and worldwide, films such as Alone at Home, Love from Heaven, and the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are popular.
The real Christmas movie boom began in 2009, when the American cable television channel Hallmark brought in a special series of movies.
Her adventure project Countdown to Christmas was a huge success, with four films.
This year, the station began feeding its viewers on Christmas Day on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Competing Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its schedule this year, with popular streaming platforms like Netflix adding to the total.
"In this magical time, the story doesn't matter so much, what matters is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing", said Brandon Gray, author of the book I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, who described the genre with a hyperbole.
"For the viewers, it's a form of escape and a way to at least for two hours feel a little bit of peace in the midst of all the holiday madness and the madness of the world we've been living in for the last couple of years", Gray added.
He says that Hallmark, for example, still uses the same formula for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then about a half hour before the end, there's a misunderstanding, which is resolved, and they kiss.
This is how it is all the time, and as long as all the movies look the same and have the same vibe, people watch one after the other, Gray adds.
Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19, and he's not gonna be in F1 until the final race.
Only 19 drivers will be entered in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not be racing until the final race of the season.
Staj Haas will only send one formula to the track.
In the final race of the season, he was to attack a better position than the 20th he had finished in qualifying.
But the Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas stable will not be racing in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He tested positive for COVID-19.
Only 19 cars will be on the grid, with Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher starting from the last corner, followed by Max Verstappen, who will be fighting Lewis Hamilton for the title.
Mazepin is in a relatively good state of mind, according to Haas, and he's showing no symptoms.
Nikita is physically okay because he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all concerned", her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not send a replacement rider to the race, nor can he.
A possible substitute would have to do a qualifying or a race in another part of the weekend.
COVID-19 is not a first-person race.
At the start of the season, Kimi Räikkönen tested positive for Covid-19, and last year, Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
You could go to jail for that, too.
And everybody will be indifferent to what the boss said.
From a legal point of view, COVID is on the list of contagious diseases.
That's in the same group as HIV, plague, yellow fever, or typhoid.
Section 152 Spread of a contagious human disease
(1) A person who intentionally causes or increases the risk of introducing or spreading a contagious disease in humans shall be punished by imprisonment for six months to three years, a ban on activity or confiscation of property.
(2) By deprivation of liberty for two to eight years, the offender shall be punished
(c) if by so doing he breaches an important duty arising from his employment, profession, position or office or imposed on him by law; or
(d) if by such an act he causes serious damage to health.
(3) A person shall be punished by a term of imprisonment of three to ten years if he causes serious bodily injury or death to at least two persons by an act referred to in paragraph 1.
(4) A person shall be punished by a term of imprisonment of between five and twelve years if he causes the death of at least two persons by an act referred to in paragraph 1.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds, the price tag of the most expensive sweater is amazing!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put six months of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters were never very worn in my home", admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his work in six months.
The silk was bought in Italy, the 24-karat gold thread in France, and 2,000 ornamental crystals supplied by the Swarowski company.
The silver stars were then embellished with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater a softness, it praises its creator for his work, which, of course, does not recommend laundering".
And there's another catch.
I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as fast as possible, Leban admits.
If he succeeds, he'll set a world record.
The most expensive sweater ever sold, five years ago, cost 720,000.

The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Women, explorers and drone pilots could be on the ground before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are to assist their Polish colleagues in protecting the border with Belarus and in the planned construction of the fence.
Poland has formally asked for help from NATO countries in connection with the months-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating on Polish territory.
The Omicron mutation is spreading to southern Moravia?
Hygiene is working on another case of the Adamov child.
We've now received another suspected case of this variant in another of Adam's children, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov's hospital is not proven, Ciupek said.
Six cases in the county in a week.
We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases  by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Flu Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague,  the Director said.
She added that they were two nurses from one of the workplaces of the University Hospital in Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old students of the Adamov University Hospital.
There is no connection between the cases in Brno and Adam.
Three of them have mild symptoms, according to the director, four have no symptoms.
No one with Omicron has traveled abroad.
None of the above have traveled abroad, none of their families, nor have they had any contact with anyone who has been abroad.
None of the above is connected to the water polo championship, Ciupek said.
Chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová earlier said that an international water polo tournament was being investigated, which was held in Brno a few weeks ago.
There were South African players on the team, and a Belgian player got sick after he came back.
California is restricting gun sales.
He wants to go with Texas' abortion ban.
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced plans on Saturday to ban the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the most populous state in the United States, using the same legal mechanism that Texas used in its controversial law against abortion performed after the detection of an embryonic heartbeat.
People would be entitled to a lawsuit against anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and home-made firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement was in response to a U.S. Supreme Court opinion Friday that upheld Texas' abortion ban, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent that established the right to abortion nationwide until approximately 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the Court has not now ruled on the constitutionality of the whole Act, but on a technical question arising from the innovative design of the measure.
The ban was enforced in this case by the public, which made it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual judicial process.
"I am outraged by yesterday's decision by the United States Supreme Court that allowed Texas to maintain its ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas's move to protect its law", the California governor said.
"If states can now block federal review of their laws, then California will use that power to protect human lives", Newsom continues.
He allegedly instructed his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the minister of justice to develop measures that would empower public officials to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
That's how you identify homemade weapons that don't have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand at least $10,000 in damages and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, "ghost weapon" parts or kits for their manufacture in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these dreadful weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do", the California governor said.
AP notes that California has had a decade-long ban on the manufacture and sale of certain military-style weapons, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to reinstate the ban using the Texas model, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who, in her dissenting opinion on Friday's majority decision, warned against extending the legal mechanism to other states.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant Texas' abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review, and allowed abortion clinics to continue to sue selected officials in the southern U.S. state.
Every emergency vaccination has its public testing phase, where we gradually come up with what the vaccine schedule will look like and also improve the vaccines themselves based on the results.
There's a big study coming out of Israel, for example, on the effects of four doses.
And according to these studies, most patients have up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which has the long-term effect you mentioned.
It's just like any other vaccination, it's gonna have its own schedule, but it's too soon.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on an inactivated virus is about to be released that, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises to be up to 10 times more effective.

Poland threatened to suspend payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would be acting unlawfully if it used its new powers to stop the disbursement of money to Poland because of the rule of law dispute.
The Commission has already postponed approval of Poland's plan to draw €36 billion from the EU's recovery fund for economies hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism to withdraw EU subsidies from countries that are in breach of the rule of law.
'Poland should respond to this EU blackmail with a veto on all matters requiring unanimity,' said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would have lost its narrow majority in the Sejm.
'Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU energy and climate policies, which are driving up energy prices drastically,' added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland cease its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable, given that the EU is illegally withholding funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party is more radical in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes made to the Polish judiciary under Ziobrów's leadership threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobra, Brussels is "imposing impossible conditions" because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland.
Warsaw faces "political dictatorship through blackmail and attempts to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles", Ziobro said.
He said Poland should be a member of an EU based on the partnership of sovereign states, not on the government of the strongest and a Brussels bureaucracy not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never make such concessions to Brussels as would limit Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony", he declared.
But to be very specific, we have the same kind of cheese in four different places at Lidl.
I didn't look for other things, I found a yogurt several times, all I needed was cheese, parmesan, and after ten minutes at the milk shelves, I gave up and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector, they had all the select, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetable and the lactose-free zone...
If there's a curfew, I won't go to any market, no action, no action, the gold shop on the square, they may not have such a selection, but usually they have everything I need and it has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Liddle to take a vacation.
And I don't care about that anymore.

Wow, that's a relief.
Sorry about the spill, and have a nice day.
I was punished with a stove when I was a kid.
It was never about my grades, it was mostly about my repeated refusal to obey and being mean (reading to me instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always threatened me first that if I did it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after another "picking" the stove, she would just bring it and put it down so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to obey did I get a few shots on the back of my head (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in a reasonable manner and to a certain extent) is beneficial because it has a much stronger effect on a child than words do.
What's important, I think, is the warning part, because it gives the child a choice in a way, whether to disobey and get it, or to improve and not get punished.
In the end, I usually just needed a warning to start listening.
Defending the System
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl in 1999 answered a journalist's question about what the Czech Constitution means to him  whether it is a sacred document that is sworn to and that is taught in school or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he decidedly leaned towards the first concept.
Once we agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it's better to be conservative with changes.
And imagine: some nations have their own rules, even love them.
Just as the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, the question was asked by Vojtěch Cepl.
Recently, however, there has been a growing opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs amendments.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not have foreseen, such as the behavior of a directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be considered.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to overcoming most of the crises that societies have faced throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a system of government made up of individual rules that set the rules for politicians to play by.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we tie politicians to the bars.
But at the same time, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid doesn't choose, the FN in Brno is fighting for the life of a few-month-old baby
Although the coronavirus is known to be more mild in children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are less at risk and affected than adults, we are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults", Petr Dominik, head of the Children's Anesthesiology and Resuscitation Clinic at Brno University Hospital and Masaryk University Faculty of Medicine, told Novink.
The course is much easier, more gentle, often symptom-free.
But there are child patients who are very sick with coronavirus, which we see especially in the recent period", added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need some mild supportive care.
It takes place in a pediatric infectious disease clinic.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus have only recently been in the ARU.
The children with post-covid syndrome were in the doctor's ward continuously throughout the year.
There is now an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, i.e. pneumonia requiring resuscitation beds,he said, adding that the disease affects both adolescents and several-month-old babies as well as adults.
Children in critical condition due to coronavirus are also being seen in hospitals.
We have a child of several months and an adolescent at present,said the head of the district.
He is however happy that no child deaths have been reported at FN Brno Children's Hospital due to coronavirus.
According to the available data, on 6 December, six children aged 0 to 14 years died in the Czech Republic.
According to Dominic, the children's hospital is an integral part of the psychologist's collaboration, not just in the coronavirus ward.
It also points out that vaccination, as in adults, also reduces the course of the disease and the incidence of postcovid syndrome in children.
"That's why we recommend the vaccine dose for children", the doctor added.
In the comfort zone, you can only go along the marked roads.

In general, in national parks outside the quiet zone you can walk anywhere (but don't climb over the fence into the enclosure).
Skiing/cycling in the forest off-road is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exemption (but of course it's not so much watched outside the national parks).
How does a conductor practice?
The music is playing in my head, Josef Kurfiřt is laughing.
He's a Liberian opera fan and originally played the forest horn.
As a singer, he can sing practically any repertoire and as a conductor he works not only in the Liberec Divadle F. Šalda, but also in Plzeň, in the Divadle Josef Kajetán Tyla.
He collaborates with the Hradcany Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic or the Podkrkonošsky Symphony Orchestra.
China is building the impression that the epidemic is under control and that the authoritarian regime is coping better with the crisis
Sin Jirologoush: China is giving the impression that the epidemic is under control and that the authoritarian regime is better at handling the crisis.
China has launched a health and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was rebuffed for failing to stop a disease that had become a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero new cases.
Countries including the Czech Republic are vying for Chinese protective gear, and Chinese doctors are helping to fight the coronavirus in many countries, including Italy, the worst-hit country.
How do you see Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says, "Hey, you want an elephant?"
I got it, and it's great.
My wife loves it because she mows the lawn, she washes the car with a stove, the kids play with it.
It's just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Friend: we'll have a good time.
After a while, they meet and the one who bought complains: you dude, what did you sell for an elephant????
The lawn is all flat, there's a big pile of shit everywhere, the car's parked, the kids are scared of him, and the wife wants a divorce.
The guy who sold it says, "You talk bad about an elephant, you can't sell an elephant like that".
World events are controlled by the great powers.
Although sovereign nations are equal, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a great power if it works towards integration.
It is currently functioning at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think Europe is moving towards federalisation.
It won't be 10, 15 or 20 years from now.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the mood will change and it will work.
I thought of that myself, and it's possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm a lexicographer.
I'm just assuming that an ellipse usually involves two different units on the same level.
To borrow an example from another comment, Spanish oranges and tangerines are both clearly from Spain, whereas Spanish fruit and tangerines are not clearly from Spain.
Moreover, I'm basing this on the fact that the phrase is "all American forces", including their weapons, and that I know that American facilities are operated by Americans only.
In other words, I expect it to be covered by the broad term and not need to be specified further for the US forces.
But again, maybe I'm just saying words:
Either way, it's a meaningless request.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the monkey of the cosmonaut Milly
The chilling footage shows a frightened monkey crouching in a toilet bowl before its callous owner washes it and laughs at it.
The Dutch monkey also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
A Gwent magistrates' court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, reports The Sun.
The ape rehabilitation specialists who are taking care of Milly after her abuse said they've never seen an alien so terrified.
Milly spent nearly two years in rehab with Monkey World workers in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The mother of four pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the Magistrates Court in Gwent, she was given a 12-week suspended sentence suspended for one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, banned from keeping animals for life, and ordered to pay a total of CZK 12,000 in court costs.
The leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said, "Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue".
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She would crouch and hide from everyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement would make her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she is settled and satisfied with a male, the sight of new humans can still cause her to panic.
The psychological scars of the abuse will be with her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's harassment came to light after police in Gwent discovered frightening footage on her phone following a raid on her apartment over a drug charge.
In the footage, you can hear Milly swearing vulgarly.
In the next video, we hear Holland's monkey offering cocaine and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner, Russell Cox, 43, admitted to possessing cocaine with the intent to sell it.
At her home, 1,600 pounds of cocaine was found hidden in Kinder's eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a 20-month suspended sentence.
And what wonderful concepts will you learn from that ancestor three times in a row as you bravely leap across the entire 20th century?
You're gonna wear the same stuff in freshman year that you wore in sixth grade?
And it kills the whole idea of the biffle, where no one, with few exceptions, cares if you can do it or understand it.
You write a test for a one, and then nobody cares.
Run and ask random people on the street if they can figure out the character of the roots of the quadratic equation and the coefficients.
Everybody's been through it, and the vast majority of people don't even cross their fingers and tell you they're totally fucked.
So what the fuck is he studying for?
I'm a big fan of the overview, and the fact is, people don't want and don't need to.
And at that point, it's pointless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
It's partly learning for the many people who will need this thing.
But like, the comment that you don't really need all that stuff to stand at the machine, I meant it in the truest sense of the word because you don't.
Plus, we're getting to the point where not knowing is a sign of punk.
(Which probably includes our communist past and our anti-education and anti-elite biases) Of course, the cost of having barbarians stand by these machines is simply too high.
If journalists could count, the covid probably never reached this scale.

Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right away", Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to the general questions of curious fans, who were so disappointed with Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even blocked him on social networks.
There's been a rift between Kadri and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri had lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move in with her, at least until she returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she was adamant that she would not.
And as you can see, their relationship not only didn't end in love, but rather grew from mutual disrespect to hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! angered by the turn of the Kadri in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
Kadri's supposed honesty was no longer liked by his ex-wife, nor was it by his younger sister, Linda.
She decided to defend her brother publicly.
I don't normally comment on these things, and we never really said these things to each other in the family.
I don't want to stir up any remorse.
But when I see someone trying to hurt and sully the name of someone I love so much in public, I just can't take it!
I'm sorry to have to do this this way, but I would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it most, despite how young he was.
It makes me feel even more sorry to read such false information that is probably taken out of context.
I wish so much that everyone would know Kadri as I, our loved ones and family, stand in confession in reaction to Andrey's words.
I am truly grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what they write, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the facts and know what it really was, she added indefinitely.
A drunken thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what it's for.
Cchao started his robbery in a residential area parking lot, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the available information, he eventually stole from one vehicle a total of less than 330 crowns.
After that, he could think of nothing better than to climb up to the fifth floor and enter the apartment through an open window.
He stole two bananas.
One of the security cameras then caught him walking down the street away from the crime scene, eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found the bananas were not where they were, and he called the police.
She then detained Cchaa.
The man admitted to having a few drinks on the day of the crime.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob in a drunken rage.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
A drunk climbed up the facade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and tied to the pandemic emergency.
If that is repealed, the law will not be effective.
Although the law limits the scope of business
Isn't that reason enough?
The right to assemble will be limited but not abolished.
Over 60 percent of voters turned out for Saturday's four municipal elections.
The new councilors were elected in the communities of Komňa in the region of Uherskhradiště, Lužice in the region of Mostek, Nová Ves in the region of Liberec and Rovná in the region of Pelhřimovsk.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the number established by law or the representative councils elected there have been dissolved.
A total of 28 seats were contested by 99 candidates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33.
The processing of the results of Saturday's election symbolically concludes a rather difficult but successful year for us.
A total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils took place in the parliament, and especially the very closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said Eva Krumpová, vice-chairwoman of the CSA.
She recalled that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the choices were more demanding for equipment and personnel security.
In Komny, Hungary, the Independent Candidates won 27.76% of the vote and two seats in the seven-member assembly.
STAN's candidate received 24.84% of the vote, which also means a gain of two mandates.
Two seats in the representative council were also won by Citizens for the Commons, with 18.52% of voters casting their ballots.
Again, the current mayor of the village, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Soukromniki, got into the representation.
The Commune has won one seat in the Chamber of Deputies with independent candidates.
Turnout was 75.48 percent of eligible voters.
In the village of Rovna in the Pelhřimov region, the Pro Rovna association won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four seats out of seven.
Two more representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were elected to the Municipal Council.
Voter turnout was 93.62%.
The repeated elections in Lužica na Mostecu were won by the Lužica and Svinčice Association led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It won 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, has four mandates in the seven-member representation.
The second place candidate is the People's Party candidate, who received 43.27% of the votes, which means that the party will have three representatives.
76.7 percent of the electorate turned out.
The election in New Vessa in Liberec was won by the independent candidates of the New Hope for Vessa before the ANO Movement.
The coalition of independent candidates was voted by 59.88 percent of voters, winning four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the vote and against the 2018 regular elections, it strengthened, gained one more mandate and has three.
The voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
On Monday, the results of the election will be discussed by the State Election Commission.
Then they'll be published in the Law Collection.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or dead foreign policy?
I think you know all that stuff people write you.
You're just playing dumb so you have someone to "disagree" with.
If not, it is sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the goal, after all, to make them look good).
And I don't care what anyone believes.
On the other hand, I'm bothered by how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it raised, how it suppressed science, and so on.
Not to mention all the wars it's caused, like the one that took place 30 years ago.
T:Dr: Believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church can't do anything together
A man fell headfirst from 40 feet.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
An incredible fall was witnessed by a man in Ostrava on Sunday night, who was rescued by the Regional Medical Rescue Service.
County operations personnel responded to a 911 call just after midnight on Saturday with preliminary information about a man's fall from a height.
Two medical and medical teams from the U.S. Air Force immediately rushed to the scene.
Upon arrival, paramedics discovered that the 27-year-old man had fallen from a window from a height of about 40 feet [12 m] and had hit his head on concrete!
The coal has been caught in the Whirlpools.
But not as much as it should be, and the fire department got involved.
By the time the rescue teams arrived, the man was unconscious, suffering multiple injuries and in immediate danger of life.
The doctor in the hospital injected a tube into his airways, provided artificial respiration and after further pre-hospital emergency care, an ambulance transported him to the Ostrava trauma center for further care, said Lukáš Humpl, spokesman for the Regional Health Service.
I'm more worried about the coronavirus than the public's inadequate response to the authorities.
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and healthcare workers are the first line of defense against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?
We're here to ask military physician David Cutter.

The legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA had a great night of gala action with some interesting results.
Because at UFC 269, things were happening.
Outsider Julianna Peña has defeated legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who hasn't found a slayer in seven years.
Charles Oliveira in the lightweight did not hesitate, he made a great throttle against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The victory was also claimed by Kai Kara-France, who quickly knocked out Cody Garbrandt with a technical knockout in the first round.
His opponent was also beaten by Sean O'Malley.
A surprise that no one expected.
This was the result of a women's bantamweight match between the world-famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Penne.
The American entered the battle as an imaginary dwarf, Nunes had not lost in seven years and was grinding her teeth for another triumph.
The beginning of the duel was, moreover, in the spirit of paper-based assumptions.
Nunes started the race very aggressively and even gave her opponent a push kick that sent her to the ground.
However, Penne did not allow herself to be forced to make any further mistakes and unsuccessfully attempted to attack with a lever on her hand.
The second round was a thrilling and very exciting one for MMA fans.
Both rivals were blessed with a lot of excellent strokes and hard hooks.
Plus, Penny got Nunes on the ground, where she started strangling her.
She had to give up and go for it.
The American has shocked everyone by becoming the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the lightweight title fight between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier.
Poirier did better at first, but then things started to turn around.
In the second, Oliveira tried to be more active, trying to knock the opponent down with a lever on his hand.
He didn't do too well, but then he made a big push, got the opponent on his back and dealt him a series of blows.
He won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to knock the strangulation off.
The Brazilian defended the title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley won the fight, by throwing a hard right back at Raulian Paeva in the first round.
He then beat him with a series of precise punches, recording his 15th triumph.
Kara-France was able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a baby girl, now losing after seven years.
The hip or the hip?
It's not that complicated at first.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, and it is not difficult to determine whether they are masculine, feminine, or intermediate.
Then there is a relatively large group of nouns whose gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two families.
When bent, they become double-ended and in some cases remain in a non-bent form.
For example, the words "swizel" and "kychel" are both masculine and feminine, the former being declined according to the pattern "mastryo", the latter according to the pattern "song".
For other groups of nouns, the forms are different from the first case of the singular, for example: redek/redka, kedluben/kedlubna or brambor/brambora (meaning food).
Both forms are literary, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example okurka in Bohemia and okurek in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is not written, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: příkop and příkopa, kobliha and koblih etc.
Some words that have entered Czech from other languages were originally unmarked, but gradually they take over Czech suffixes.
Typical examples are the expression image, which is both masculine and feminine, or the word bufet, which remains unflattered in the middle gender, but has a masculine ending in the pattern of hrad.
Turkey opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What's the situation on the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border due to the increasing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people started to move towards the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped blocking them.
European politicians are pledging support to Greece, and the Czech government is also planning humanitarian aid.
What motivates refugees to take such a precarious path?
And what's the situation on the ground?
We hadn't seen blue skies in three months and were suffocating, says Sydney journalist
The devastating fires that have gripped Australia for four months have killed nearly three dozen people, hundreds of millions of animals, and millions of acres of land.
How are the authorities and the people coping?
Could the government of Prime Minister Morrison have done more to prevent the drastic consequences that critics claim?
And what will the earth need to prepare for in the future in the face of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel is speaking to Sydney journalist Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why they're always written about everywhere.
People are uncomfortable with how sexual violence looks in our society and how rampant it is, so they try to cover it up.
I don't know anyone who's been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped and I've seen how these people are often treated by their community or even the police.
A victim should always be trusted.
It's become a trend that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse others.
It's gross and it's spit in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "much of the blame is fabricated" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping the sexual abusers.
The Czech Republic is flooding with unbuilt houses, families have no money to finish
Building material prices have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people got into a tight spot because of it.
She has no funds to finish the detached family homes and the banks refuse to extend her mortgage loans.
In addition to material costs, the cost of building work is also rising.
As a result, people do not have enough money to finish the family homes that are already being built.
In many cases, banks refuse to extend mortgages to them, creating an extremely unpleasant situation.
In the best case, people move into unconstructed and uncolored houses.
In the worst case, the houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay the mortgage and the rent", says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two or three single-family houses in a year, and 50 percent of us have done it.
It's hard for us as a construction company to keep certain things in the contract, even if the material is expensive.
So we do without income", said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are gonna have financial problems.
If they counted on building a house for five million, it's gonna cost them seven.
I think some of them will wait", added Slivon.
The most expensive materials were copper, iron, and plumbing and drying equipment.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
The Czech Republic is short of graduates in civil engineering and the influx of foreign workers is slowing the pandemic.
The only situation that is more favourable at the moment is that of the issuing of building permits.
The building authorities issued 7 675 building permits in October, almost 10% more than a year ago,said Křeček.
We're doing well, and we're gonna do better.
But the real vision is missing, says commentator ČRO  myRozhlas
Traditionally, the New Year has been marked by political speeches as well as traditional celebrations.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and Chairman of the National Assembly, Andrej Babiš, and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also addressed the nation.
What have we learned that is vital?
I'm doing my bachelor's degree, and I'm doing my bachelor's degree, and I'm doing my bachelor's degree, and I'm doing my bachelor's degree, and I'm doing my bachelor's degree, and I'm doing my bachelor's degree, and I'm doing my bachelor's degree, and I'm doing my bachelor's degree, and I'm doing my bachelor's degree, and I'm doing my bachelor's degree, and I'm doing my bachelor's degree, and I'm doing my bachelor's degree, and I'm doing my bachelor's degree, and then I'm doing my master's degree, and then I'm doing my master's degree, and then I'm doing my master's degree, and then I'm doing my doctorate, and then I'm doing my doctorate, and then I'm doing my doctorate, and then I'm doing my doctorate.
The state is cool with us, unless you're a total jerk and have something left in your head, the commission won't choke you on theory.
I was studying for the State Examination for a week, and when I was in the end, the committee always tried to guide me to some logical deduction, which I immediately got right.
Other than those projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we've done it many times, it's really beneficial, it'll teach a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
I think it's great when there's a test at the end of the course, and it reflects the knowledge gained from the project, not just the defense.
All right, but don't block e-mails and phone calls and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be just as much of a dick as they are.
The people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they're against Russia, they're taking a big risk, so maybe they have to play them because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you could put a statue of Putin next to the bear Pu.
You've got to put it so it fits Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing a bone in the artist's foot.
Once you're not posting stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach is reduced to a bare minimum.
Plus, they're always changing which feature is more important, like, comment or save.
I've been really pissed off lately, so I may have to get down to the level where a lot of artists in my industry are having success and they're barely getting away with it.
I'd like to see something user-friendly that doesn't suck the artist's creativity and energy out of them.
Declaration of the Party of the Workers of Donbass
The union  yes, the break-up  no, the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion in the image.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8th, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in the history of mankind took place.
In the Belovzhskaya Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the openly sympathetic attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republic as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist".
With the stroke of a pen, they destroyed a vast land of almost three hundred million people.
With the collapse of the Soviet Union, tens of millions of ethnic Russians found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia's population has declined by 10 to 11 million.
Even without the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who in one sitting in the White Forest destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately de-industrialized, they crippled agriculture, they cut off the world's greatest power from the 14 republics that were previously economically linked into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the breakdown of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the break-up of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all of these are the result of geopolitical capitulation, the surrender of the socialist camp first, and then the Soviet Union.
There's a term in political science called the power vacuum.
Everything that was hastily betrayed and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken by the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a high-volume supermarket may not correspond directly to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat at the supermarket that costs $18 a pound.
I'm gonna buy it by putting it in the fridge and making dinner out of it on Thursday.
In an alternative reality where I don't buy meat on Monday, the chain sells it for $1.50 a pound on Tuesday - what is the mechanism that makes the meat, by changing its price, a burden on my digestive system?
Or do I wait until Thursday and the meat is discounted to £6.00 a kilo the day before the expiry date - how would this meat differ from the one I bought on Monday for £1.20 and left in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer to myself - nothing.
This bullshit about if something's cheap, it's guaranteed to be bad, rotten or low-grade is terribly retarded, to tell you the truth.
I went to Brno recently and the girls were handing out a brochure, I always take such things to help the brigade, they can't throw it away...
Well, the pamphlet was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but nothing about God, and I was confused, but I knew it was gonna be some kind of a riot.
I read it, I found out who published it, and it turned out to be Scientology.
Well, like it was a good-ass, full of completely useless instructions, like I was supposed to wash and not be a cunt.
Too bad about the paper, this is why the forests shouldn't be cut down.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with the person because you love them without realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened to hurt me a couple of times because I was going out with a friend who she didn't like to talk to outside.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she started crying and begged me not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
It was a great relationship for a year, but then another six months went by and she started to get a little freaked out.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her that I was breaking up and I was begging her to talk about it next week to calm her down and to keep her from getting upset.
A person like that sucks the feelings, the emotions, the joy out of you.
Better to keep your distance
When the insurance companies are frantically sneaking in, buying up a cloud of tests and chasing down positive ones who wouldn't even know about this terrible disease if it wasn't for the test.
All we're doing is complicating things for businesses, carriers and others, because their employees are getting five days of house arrest in a random number generator.
The West has stopped this foolishness and recognized that there is no point in dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, the Vulture is new and has to steal something and fuel his ego by making up bullshit.
Looks like we got our old-fashioned good ol' boy back.
After years of suppressing and suppressing this unfair business, MLM recruiting is back in full swing.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman in college), the initial promises of product training and business skills quickly became "you don't care, just get people".
I was genuinely interested in the products I was offering because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare people and talk to them.
When the first money came in, it was quickly realized that if you wanted to make money, you had to put up a few products a month.
Life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, so you felt like a pot-selling man at home.
What can I say, it was a valuable experience, one learns not to jump to every single piece of information and check it thoroughly.
I wouldn't put them all in the same bag at the same time.
There are people in this business who are successful and even helpful to people, but they certainly will not boast of expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
I've never seen much of this in the corporate world where I work.
HR is cool, managers are minding their own business, and they're not poking our noses into anything.
So, the regular evaluation is something that happens, in the form that it is in here, it's quite possible (set some goals for next year, next year we'll see what went well and what didn't) - it's more of a self-evaluation than someone evaluating you based on some numbers and so on.
Corporate actions are also optional.
But we're also a little bit unique within our company -- there are departments that are more corporate.
Sometimes you get the feeling that we're some sort of near-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works so we don't bother much as long as we get the results.
The Czech missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, British police have been searching for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing in late November.
On Sunday, December 12, the outgoing Minister of Foreign Affairs Jakub Kulhanek announced on social media that a woman from Ukherskohradishte had been found dead.
British police confirmed to our London representative office this afternoon that they had found the body of a missing Czech woman.
The cause of death is under investigation.
We will not be releasing any more information about the case, due to family concerns.
"My deepest condolences", Kulhánek tweeted on his Twitter account.
The young woman was last seen on November 28 on a bus on her way home from work to pick up some money from an ATM before boarding.
Her colleagues reported her missing five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began to search for her, Interpol included her in the list of missing persons worldwide.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police arrested a man in connection with the case a few days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what he's suspected of, but she didn't say.
In four municipalities, new councils were created by the end of the year.
On Saturday, 11 December, new representatives were elected in the municipalities of Komňa in the Ugorskohradišť region, Lužice in the Mostec region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the number established by law or the representative councils elected there have been dissolved.
There were 99 valid candidates for 28 seats in the new elections.
The voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Rovna, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men were elected.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections to the representatives in the four municipalities.
There were 36 women and 63 men who applied for 28 positions.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72.
The processing of the results of Saturday's election symbolically concludes a rather difficult but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated elections to municipal representatives took place in it, and especially the very well-watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
"We had to work mostly in more difficult epidemic conditions, which imposed greater demands on equipment and personnel security", said Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last precinct was processed on Sunday, December 12th at 03:49 hours.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be considered by the State Election Commission and, once approved, will be published in the Law Library.
This is the biggest problem I've had with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we had a very dangerous contagious disease in the very beginning, but it was no big deal.
To deal with the idiotic attitude of a large part of the population at all levels, that's been a problem for me so far.
I'm looking forward to the vaccination tomorrow because it'll make me less dependent on other people being not a piece of shit.
He would be stripped of the office of president and the ability to reassume it.
The chances of that actually happening, as the others here are saying, are very slim.
Besides, I'm not sure that a paper carded would qualify as treason.
Treason is an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: A growing number of people under 35 years of age who have been without sex for a year
More and more young adults in the U.S. are living their lives without sex.
These are mostly religious-based people, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the percentage of people under 35 who have given up on sex increased from 8 to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who said they had not had sexual intercourse in the past year are more likely than ever to have had it.
Other factors are contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of these may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and higher unemployment rates.
But it could also be the presence of media, social networks, and video games that make sex less and less of a priority for young people.
Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between 18 and 35 years of age who say they have not had sex in the previous year has been rising rapidly,says IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Married people are more likely to have sex, with only 5% of married people reporting having no sex in the past year in 2021.
Among single people, the figure was 29 percent. Stone added that marriage by age 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital sex and religious affiliation also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although husbands are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married men under 35 is still declining.
Young people's view of premarital sex is divided, with about 30% saying it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It's true that among free individuals in this age group, they are a minority, but their behavior is shifting the trend", Stone says of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious background.
Since 2008, the abstinence rate for single people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20 to nearly 60 percent.
Among the less religious, the trend has risen from 10 to 20 percent", said Stone.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and, most notably, social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that people with no jobs or lower incomes are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, thus 'replacing' this need.
This trend has been especially evident during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole point of the COVID vaccine mandate is whether society should force a part of the population to behave in a way that they don't want to, but that could save their lives.
It's a rather difficult question, and the one that I'm most interested in personally is the question of social conscience.
I.e., the question of whether if we don't give it to them and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we could have caused the death of an 80-year-old man who didn't know much, we didn't explain it to him well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he didn't get the shot and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can blame the death of a staunch anti-vaccinationist who, alongside the SPD and the KSC, is bragging about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I've mentioned, it's pretty clear that most unvaccinated retirees are likely to fall into the second category, so they'll really be the ones to blame.

How does a mild winter signal a struggle with drought?
This year's winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the few snowfalls in recent times.
The ski resort operators are not without technical snow, the weather complicates even the preparation of the ski slopes of the Jizera.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will the little snow mean to fight the drought in the Czech Republic?
I have a story, but it's not about a bread eater.
In high school, one day, a teacher led us across town to the boathouse so we could ride on the riverboats.
On our way there, we passed through a rather wide street, and we did not see anyone in the middle - a Hare Krishna follower.
Of course they're coming at us.
I was lucky to escape, but a friend of mine and I got into a fight.
After she left, we asked her and the teacher what she had said.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
"I told them I had no soul", she replied.
Everyone, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We are so spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already crashing, says Orozović
The new German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where he was greeted with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in our relations", Mr Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
The Commission has also adopted a communication on the implementation of the 'European Strategy for the Development of the Black Sea' (ESDP) and the 'European Strategy for the Development of the Black Sea' (ESDP).
The crisis, triggered by the worrying movements of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border, should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the 'Normandy Group', which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that he informed the Chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko has artificially created a migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because night after night we record a hundred attempts to (illegal) cross the border.
He's been negotiating with the Chancellor for further sanctions to make the Lukashenka regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
According to DPA, Scholz asserted that Warsaw enjoyed German support in its dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by the Lukashenka regime.
A drunk Polish nun caused the accident, tried to cover it up.
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but the driver was another nun, who tried to take the blame.
When police told her that she could lose her license for not giving priority to her driving and for running away from the scene of an accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun ran into the vehicle and asked for her help.
Then the police came for Celestina's sister.
She was given a breath test, and after finding that she had more than two promille in her blood, she was immediately stripped of her driver's license.
She was also told that she would be making a confession in court.
Hugo's dog is doing the best he can.
But Juraj Shaimovich did not keep his film.
Czech family comedy creators have looked into American stories about pet dogs.
But they forgot the essential thing: the legitimacy of the film craft.
After the film "F. Brabce Gump, the dog who taught people how to live", the audience is now looking for emotions in the cinema.
Co-writer and director of the film Juraj Šajmovič ml. freely follows his previous film Here I Watch from 2012.
Hugo the talking dog returns to the stage with some of the familiar characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a sleepy-away boarding house, who are dying, invite the dog-sitters, Julia's father and his partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) had already struggled with the storytelling techniques in the previous film about dogs, but at least the children and the dog were entertained there.
This time, the creative team wrote an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of awe and embarrassment.
Let's just sum it up.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to the illusions of the Tamari in her desire for a child, and if the right "constellation" comes, copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are just determined on the hood of the car or the church tower (of course during the ongoing excursion with the local guide), the retired colonel Mojm, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julii) in the forest, who falls into a coma, then is taken away by the family to the hospital, so that the heart of the Tamarian solitude can play a ghastly healing process.
Nothing against the cleansing power of nature and the power of animal lovers.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at the amount of content, full of untrue situations and figures, that was needed to deliver this message.
A pair of staff thieves, a dog-eat-dog contest, a charlatan, a policeman coming to the hearing looking for drugs and discussing over herbs the fertile powers of bone meal which the baked family at the boarding house of course gets drunk on.
When the heroine wakes up from a deep coma and suddenly sits at the family table, all scrubbed and smothered with a cigar, and demands her father's whiskey and flutes as a healed vegetarian, it's impossible not to laugh.
And then the creator explains to the viewer that sometimes things happen after a coma.
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to expose the nose situation, a sense for the characters and the point and the direction.
The acting is off-balance, the editing is unruly, and the overall impression is one of obsession.
However much Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to keep their party going, they don't have much to play for.
The only highlight of the film is the poetic footage of the wild nature of the cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of hedgehogs.
It's not enough to sketch out a few characters, a shallow plot and doggy lines, let alone the more vulgar human expressions the characters indulge in.
Nor is the fact that she's a longtime member of the Sea Bass Breeders' Club - as in the case of Mrs. Producer - an argument.
Behind the good intentions of promoting nature and the friendship of man with the dog must be a knowledge of the craft if one is to tell a credible story.
That didn't work in this case.
For a good family picture, there's a little too much eroticism and a minimum of genre sense.
Even as a canisteria commercial, this amateurish little stunt wouldn't have worked.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant abuse from jerks like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, and that's how you know shit, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always the customer's, if the customer doesn't want to, the answer is always no.
If you listened to kids like that all the time, maybe you'd change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in this case, a pay-as-you-go job.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of rainfall during November, as we have seen in some stations, is unusual", confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of its long-term rainfall average for November.
The two days of rain this week were therefore rather exceptional.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a long time.
It's also the right Christmas scene, the happy Nazarene Wasim Ashkar.
Israel's rainfall falls almost exclusively in the winter months, and is sudden and irregular.
Winter rain is the only thing that keeps the forests alive.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fire.
It's not just forests, but also water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
Israel's largest freshwater body, the Sea of Galilee, has been filled to the brim this spring thanks to three recent wet winters.
It's been going down ever since.
Water managers have been warning about drought for a long time.
It can be expected that depending on global warming and climate change, precipitation may decrease, predicted in 2018 the spokesman of the Israeli Water Authority Uri Schor.
Israel can help with technologies like desalination and wastewater recycling.
The economically weaker countries like Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan are worse off.
The streets of Jordan's capital, Amman, are flooded with tankers.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"This year my orders have increased by 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years", tanker driver Imad Sulejman reported in September.
In Isfahan, Iran, clashes broke out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The local riverbed was completely dry.
The region has had the driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing for military action against Iran.
The Israeli defense minister said that the talks in Vienna had made no progress and that he had informed Washington of the preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz said Saturday that he has ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, according to Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the US, has been trying to convince the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but has also informed Washington of the military buildup.
Speaking at a news conference in Florida, Gantz said the nuclear talks in Vienna had "no progress" and that world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing games with them".
About three years ago, this happened to me.
I liked the lady a little and I grilled the interview to find out what she really wanted from me.
Eventually, I found that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
As I really don't like these tricks, I bombarded the lady with doubts and questions for a while, and then I thanked her and left.
You can call me a jerk, but a pyramid is a pyramid, and financial advisers are financial advisors.
The skiers headed to the mountains for the weekend, with plenty of snow and nice weather.
The Czech Republic's ski resorts experienced their first major push for skiing this weekend.
After a heavy snowfall at the end of the work week, there is no need for snow and some ski resorts have started operating thanks to it.
The requirement to have a covid certificate for birds did not deter the pilot.
While skiers are not complaining about customer apathy, some ski rental companies report lower demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec region took to the trails and the trail on the weekend.
The skiers were greeted by a sunny day and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend has really come out of the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skier on the hill", praised the interest of the director of the sports complex, Jadd Jakub Hanus.
Hundreds of people headed out for the first weekend of skiing in the new season to the Autumn Islands as well.
For example, the Ski Aréna Karlov or the resort in Brno on Šumperska were open.
The weekend was very good, with an estimated 400 people attending on Saturday and today.
Conditions are excellent.
The sun was shining today, it was about minus three degrees, so perfect, not sparing the praise of the representative of the ski resort in Brno Rostislav Procházka.
Ski operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or who are on a COVID-19 waiting list.
Except for exceptions, people are prepared and have the necessary documents, said René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski center.
"We only recorded the units of the incident", he added.
Lower than pre-pandemic interest is reported by some ski rental and equipment stores.
Interest in ski rental is fortunately there.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Opac store Skiopava.
He expects a bigger push during the ski season.
Also, the CEO of the King County Snowbear company, David Šinták, feels that because of COVID, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time, before the pandemic, we were almost out of money.
We are at about 50% compared to the pre-pandemic period, said ČTK Šinták.
He said that people have become lazy with the pandemic and have learned to stay at home.
On the contrary, the Novako on the Dignity of God area is in great demand.
They started renting skis a week ago, and now they have to pre-order.
"We are starting to rent the trains this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year", said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the premises.
The interest, comparable to the pre-epidemic period, is also for a ski school.
If we want to keep the rich and successful from going abroad, they must be able to live a quality life here like they did abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart, smart people go abroad who don't have any property here.
The owner of the company is not going abroad just like that.
But I'm totally fine with the rest.
If these people don't live well in the Czech Republic and if these people don't have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply won't live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary started with Orbán winning one day, ruling for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
The next question is the election.
If life is so bad here, then some traditional V4 nut can win here, too.
The young and educated will leave, leaving his supporters and people whose property can't be put on the plane.
The picture is terrible!
Langmajer in the blood for a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the film Island in Thailand, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), enjoyed the tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury or is it a makeup for a shoot?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behavior and we are beginning to worry about it", said Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncova worked, in a video released Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic are also very worried about her and simply want to know where she is", she continued.
Missing Czech reportedly left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28th, and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was last reportedly seen on a bus about a half hour later.
She was reported missing on December 3rd by one of her co-workers.
According to British media, Srnka worked as a nurse's assistant at the Evelyn London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
"We have grave concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing", a group of health facilities tweeted.
We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could help her find her to contact the police, the statement continued.
Harriet Harman, a member of the House of Representatives, called for public cooperation, and on Saturday, she raised the issue of Srncova's case at a press conference.
'She's been missing for a few days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death,' said the Labour politician, holding up a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family, and working here for our health care", Harman said.
Police have previously arrested a man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
However, according to the BBC news website, the police have not provided any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate the Ukraine like that either.
It's not "a huge number", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps saying that we're exaggerating the threat of invasion and it's getting its teeth into our entrance.
I quoted above.
I don't know what led him to believe that Russia wanted a war.
War is a hell of an expensive pastime, and Russia has Italy's GDP.
Compared to the situation in '38, it's off in so many points, I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare this to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily:D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia would annex those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and the "concentration" at the border would be just right.
I mean, the pacta sunt servanda...
In Prague, the new timetable will be in effect from Sunday, affecting mainly suburban connections.
The Prague Integrated Transport (PID) passenger expects several changes from Sunday, mainly concerning suburban connections.
New lines were built, some changed their routes, and some disappeared.
The integrated system is newly joined by the Republic of Moldova.
In the capital, from Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice stop at the Garden City station.
In the suburban railway, trains S7 depart from the route from Beroun to Český Brod, passing through the Prague Central Station.
The R17 high-speed train from České Budějovice and Benešov will make a new stop at the recently opened Prague-Zahra Town station.
PID will expand to new areas.
Among other things, buses will go to Světlé nad Sázavou, Blatna near Jesenice, Old Splav and Turnov.
The buses to Młodowo-Bolszawa will be included, including the lines to the Liberecký and Královéhradecký Regions.
The integration will result in the cancellation of 77 lines, the introduction of 37 new lines and the modification of 12 existing lines.
From Zličín in Prague, a new bus line 405 will run all the way to Žatca.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice near Rakovník has also been established, replacing the cancelled S53 train line.
It will be reinforced in the morning rush hour and will connect Prague to Rakovník at the weekend, when the new express line number 404 will be launched.
The new PID system includes the 400 and 410 lines to the Liberec Region.
They leave from the Střížkov metro station, not the Holešovice station.
The main line 400 runs through Mělník, Dubá and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburka or Cvikova.
The additional line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubá to Doks, Mimona and Jablonné in Podještědí.
On the contrary, the operation of ten Central Bohemian local lines, including Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmital under Třemšín, was cancelled or limited.
All trains leaving Prague at 02:30 have been cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague  Beroun, Prague  Lysá nad Labem and around Kolín.
Changes await travelers in other places as well.
Buses replace some of the cancelled railway lines or a section is extended on the 420 line from Dobříš with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets to Milevsk.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 to Nymbursk have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border between Central Čech and Hořovice in the Plzeň Region have been modified.
Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I'm working a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break, and my only option for food is to go to Billy's next door or the one a block away at Lidl's.
Since I don't have any exercise, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and diet as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, and in a hurry, I buy a pizza, a bagel, and a yogurt and an apple for my snack.
Question: What healthy, non-thermal products would you recommend I buy at the supermarket?
Not everyone expects a foot of snow like you, unfortunately.
And it's not trees that you have to see.
Only the tip of the tree can be hidden under the snow.
If they are damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason they're banning us from the sidewalk, but it's one of them.
Confession of Dara about relationship with Nedved:
Since Friday, the Czech showbiz juggernaut has lived for nothing but exposing the relationship between Dara Rollins and Pavel Nedved.
They've been going at it for years. The famous football player even got divorced for the singer.
Dara has now sent a message to her fans explaining why she kept her love a secret for six months.
"I would like to say that there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would not know that Dara has been caught by a bear, sorry, Neděda", jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
But he said he was banging her, not the other way around.
Three days in the spotlight, and although they're used to the publicity, they're not happy about it.
And there it is.
"What neither of us had expected, but we knew would happen", continues the singer.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether it's the ones who don't care and it's all coming out of their cans, or the rest of us, whose lives are being probed.
Like, if any of you wanted to hear an opinion on whether you and your spouse or girlfriend were a good match, or insisted that everyone know the full details of your ex-partner list and be familiar with your list of faults and mistakes.
It's a big deal, you want it, you're going to get hurt.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins was traveling to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedved is the vice president of Juventus football club.
They're only coming out now because they're waiting for Nedved's divorce to be finalized.
He and his wife, Ivan, have been separated for three years, but have been legally unmarried for only three weeks.
Anyway, to those of you who are happy with us and wish us well, we thank you.
We're just people, too. We have families, children, past lives, dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
And that's why I love my new husband, and because he's with me, I'm with him, for better or for worse", Rolins concluded.
Hi, the other commenters have probably said all the right things, but I just have to say that the dorm is great to start with, my classmates usually meet and make friends during the first semester or two and then find a place to live together, which seems like the best option to me, because you know who you're living with.
Apartments don't usually advertise very far in advance, so you might not find much right now, but it certainly wouldn't hurt to look at the listing.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Cejl, but also the surroundings (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), and some parts of Židenic are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, Veveří is a very student district, King's Field and in that direction it's fine, besides it's close to most of the faculties of the VUT (I don't know where exactly you're entering).
I've never looked for a rent, but I'm a native Brno, so I can consult with Brno as such, if you need any more information.
That's an example of perfectly "normal" thinking.
Because of what a few doctors decided to do in Poland, it's actually quite okay that the state doesn't adequately fund some schools.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it, or they go by the state and pay for it.
We can't let a private actor control a piece of education just because he adds a few crowns to the full state contribution and that way he can learn whatever he wants in schools.
Such a statement is somewhat less credible when written by the same person who two days earlier had commented on the boycott petition against the totalitarian state:
So voting against having an abortion is the same as voting against having a statue in the town square?
If I were you, I would consult the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I've already experienced in cataloguing/digitizing that (and even long-time professionals) either throw it out of the way or write something like xxx *** or ... (by convention) and in the note that it is illegible.
The truth is, in this case, it's pretty readable, so I wouldn't recommend it at all.
Personally, I'd probably deal with it in some kind of note depending on what program you're using.
If you want to be a good and diligent student, you can look in some character databases and find the closest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply created their own character that fits what's physically on the coin.
PS: Is it more of an Odrysian empire than an OdryN?
P.S. Someone's already been working on your case.
Look at the comment with the ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
That's a lot worse than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they'd approve something because no one understood a text is laughable.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, and even a basic knowledge of English is not enough, that's a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in the various EU institutions, and English is more suited to informal contacts, to establishing non-standard relationships, for politicians.
Plus, with the English, it's pretty interesting, after the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
I don't understand the hat on Cejl.
I've been working there for three years and I'm fine.
How many times I get home from work at 10pm and never have a problem.
Only someone who's barely set foot in the ghetto can tell that.
Yes, most of the Romani population in Brno probably lives there, but all they do is block the sidewalk and park where they don't have to.:D It's definitely not that I'm afraid to go out there in the evening.
So if you're looking for a relatively cheap condo with good access to downtown, I'd go for it.
A lot of the apartments are newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without his lady and his mistress Gelemová is like a stake in the fence!
Who's she spending Christmas with?
On Sunday most people at the Advent party lit their first candle, but Felix Slovak did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
"I've seen a lot of wreaths, and I'm sure Lucie has some", said the saxophonist, who confirmed Patras's words by visiting her often.
She visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada has remained alone since his departure.
Wordy still doesn't know where he's going to be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix and both grandchildren.
The film is about a man who is a child of the Soviet Union.
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together at the beginning!
But we kept talking, so Christmas never came.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts all the time, and I'm sure I'll get something for Dad and Lucia, like perfume.
"I'm a gentleman", added Felix, who himself attended the christening of the music video at the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to talk to, says Slovak, who was glad to meet Luďko Sobot's wife Adriana or the singer Kamil Nyvlt.
And he made that very clear.
And we're Iceland so we can afford not to have soldiers and guns?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that would be a bad argument, so explain that to me.
I don't know of any other unit that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
There are few policemen who can afford it, and there are few firefighters, and nowhere else do you find such a high percentage of people with such a level of medical training.
And the fact that our military is able to defend Ostrava is a blow to previous governments, not the military, which has been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
Agricultural subsidies must be changed, the countryside must not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is experiencing its worst drought in years.
Scientists say that water has been depleted in mountainous and subalpine areas, and that small amounts of precipitation are being recorded in places that have not previously been in need of water.
Climate change is the cause of the drought that is affecting much of central Europe.
But the way we manage the land also amplifies the impact.
What are some of the drought-related preparations?
And how can we help nature in its time of trouble?
Yeah, it's gonna be like this, I can barely keep up with the ice skates, I don't know what hockey is, and the tactics (that I tried in the Hockey Manager franchise) are totally insane.
And whether you're the Russian Bear or the Chinese Lama, losing by two goals, even though you don't have to win the game at all costs, is different than being drawn.
But anyway, what I hear Czech commentators saying, what the referees notice, they don't notice whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but it's like that with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And if it were the other way around, it's always the other way around, and the Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than it's won, I think it would be the classic "they lost" vs "WE won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily cases.
5,766 people are hospitalized.
In total, 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic is 1967 per 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
There have been 29,929 new cases reported in the last 24 hours.
It's the lowest daily count since October 13th.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The daily death toll is 1132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" big wave of infection caused by Omicron, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for the British Health and Safety Executive, said Sunday on television.
New quarantine measures will be required.
Omicron-infected people are already being hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects the number to rise.
So far, no deaths have been reported from omicron, but hospitalizations occur about 14 days after infection and deaths occur about three weeks after infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently broke the law by hosting a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when lockdown was in place and Christmas parties were banned.
A Johnson government minister defended the quiz as being conducted "virtually" on a computer.
But it was a Downing Street meeting of groups of employees gathered around computers.
In Britain, pressure is mounting to remove Johnson as Prime Minister.
During the strict lockdown in London last December, and the banning of Christmas parties, Johnson's ministers held numerous carnivals despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government have made a mockery of them:
Paul Brand, editor of the commercial television channel ITV for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won the general election by a landslide.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about removing him from office.
It's remarkable how quickly things have unfolded.
You want to turn around and save your own skin?
Hungary is waiting for elections in the spring that could end 12 years of Viktor Orbán's rule.
It will be an election of pan-European significance.
How much can you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They will probably not be free either, because neither were the last two elections under Orbán.
His party, Fidesz, controls the media, changes the boundaries of the electoral districts to profit from it, and does other tricks, smaller or larger.
The last one sounds like everyone can vote where they want.
This will allow Fidesz to lure voters from the contested districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could win.
So I'm just saying, they're not gonna be fair at all.
Do you think it's going to be as unfair as it was in 2014 and 2018?
The situation is very different.
It used to be about, not whether Fidesz wins, but how much and whether it has a constitutional majority.
Now there's a real chance that more votes and more seats will be won by the united opposition.
This is a big deal for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Will they not play harder to keep power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are prepared to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of the speaker of the parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövé, telling the heads of the intelligence services that the opposition is a threat to national security, was leaked to the independent media.
Is this the new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of the new ones.
It all starts with the tongue.
I've been beaten quite often, the last time I was 14, my parents, my mom doesn't have much patience, I don't have much patience, my dad has a lot of patience, but then he explodes extremely (only in relation to me).
I'm also very choleric and I've been raging like a baby, to the point where I've been laying on the floor in convulsions and I've been blue, and I've been taken to the shower twice to calm down.
Sometimes the teachers would slap me, sometimes it was more like they didn't know.
I definitely have a tendency to do things violently now, as a kid I was pretty aggressive, now I just hit myself for something and as a younger I was so patted by my parents, so I didn't get too much over my head, so never anything extreme, but I always have this urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my impulsiveness, but certainly the upbringing has a part to play.
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that beating children is just wrong and that my parents should not have done it, especially not at the moment when it was no longer "educational", but from frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just fucks something up, I guess it's impossible not to screw up their children a little bit, so I don't blame them.
I'm not offended by it, I don't see why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
The laws should be clear and unambiguous.
I would call them "candles" those who make laws of such quality.
I was wondering if you were worried about a power outage.
Can you really count on people wanting and buying the product and you're gonna have to pay the mortgage?
The monstrous world of the Kochner.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins with the four defendants in the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It has mobilized civil society, but also exposed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his links to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
What will the trial mean for Slovakia?
This is a huge cost to the press.
How is it possible that this petition has received much more media attention than the opposite petition of the deans of all medical schools, which was published a day or two later?
No, they were fooled, and the company took the fall for it.
On Czech TV, people were dying of COVID-19 six months ago.
Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage places nowhere
Minister Karel Havlíček 's proposal needs to be radically reworked
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is at an end and the law that was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorization of deep-sea storage of highly radioactive waste still exists.
The Government's Legislative Council has adjourned the consideration of a bill submitted to the Government by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against the Deep Deposit, but also with the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
The municipalities expect the Act to strengthen their decision-making powers in relation to the storage facility, as promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and as required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to rework the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The municipalities are particularly critical of the bill from Minister Karel Havlíček, who has the Platform available: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of a site for the storage is insufficient and cannot ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected.
It can only be truly effective if the municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue at all in the locality.
This can be ensured by requiring the Land Regie to obtain the consent of the municipalities concerned before initiating a specific procedure.
The proposed objective omits almost entirely the involvement of the public and makes citizens of the municipality virtually mere statistics in the recruitment procedures.
The proposal lacks a systematic set-up of compensation to municipalities for the whole process of finding and selecting a site for a repository, authorising it and operating it.
Municipal authorities, realistically, by today's legal standards, have little choice in how to defend the interests of their citizens when seeking a repository site.
Only in certain authorisation procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but the decision is taken by the authority or the minister in whose interest the authorisation is to be issued.
A provisional injunction shall not have suspensive effect on the execution of exploration or construction work.
The self-governance that the Platform is calling for is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries, and certainly in those that have already made progress in allowing data storage, such as Sweden or Finland.
The drafting of the law is, moreover, another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to draft the legislation.
In the present case, the contract is with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and follows on from the contracts with Jan Zemánek.
The total amount of the works is estimated to be approximately CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle in the town of Hrádek and spokesman for the Platform against Deep Waste Storage, said: "After the Ministers of Industry, who only referred to their successors for the position of the local authorities vis-à-vis the state authorities in the search for a deep repository of highly radioactive waste, we expect a more significant turn from the new government.
We're offering to help with that, too.
We also thank the Association of Cities and Municipalities for its support, which sees the issue of the lack of rights of municipalities in such crucial construction as similar to the directly affected municipalities in the selected locations.
The anti-deposit platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and 16 associations) to push for a change in the state's approach to the management of spent fuel and other radioactive waste, which is not limited to deep-disposal sites.
The Platform further advocates that the decision to select a site for possible storage be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
The actor John Goodman, 69, lost 200 pounds in a panic attack.
Although he had not needed to change his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually intimidated by the doctors.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he'd die.
And it worked.
Goodman has gradually lost 90 kilograms, half his original weight of 180 kilograms, reports The Sun.
He bragged about his new character at the Los Angeles premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a whole different person!
John used to joke that friends and family would beg him to lose weight because his big body would cause furniture to crack.
"I put everything in my mouth", the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
I wanted to take it slow this time.
I'm moving, I'm working out.
"I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still", said ABC's Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss you are and what you want to use the word "boss" for.
If it's a text on a platform that expects a gaming reader, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it was a formal text, or a college text, I'd probably look for a way to describe or explain it.
There's more than one kind of boss for everything.
Like a game like Dark Souls or whatever, there's a bunch of bosses, right, and so the "boss" is kind of like the lord/ruler of a given level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super bosses, hidden bosses) that are not needed to be defeated to complete the game or level, but are often even more powerful than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life where there are bosses, but the player doesn't directly interact with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and they can be called bosses?
And then there are the mini bosses.
It is not possible to translate boss in a flat, one-to-one way, neither in Czech nor in other languages (the only interesting thing is Catalan, which translates bosse as the final opponent).
It is simply a story or game-generating, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous ones and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The world is searching for missing London Petra.
The Czech police are involved.
The British police have been searching for missing Petra Srnka since December 3.
Czech police are also involved in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Hungary has been looking for her since December 7th.
Through Interpol, he also helps the British police.
Czech Petr Srncova was last seen by her colleagues on November 28th.
British police have been looking for her since December 3rd.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow notice for her.
So the whole world is looking for Peter.
'The Czech police are working closely with the British police,' confirmed police spokeswoman Katerina Rendlová.
"We share information about the case", she added.
The search warrant for Peter has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 5'6", skinny, with brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
She should be from Uherskohradishte.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Her friends and colleagues are concerned about her, as such disappearances are very unusual for her.
Congresswoman Harriet Harman has joined the search for Petra.
She was involved in the flyers with Petra's face on them.
"We have great concerns about her", she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already detained one suspect.
But it's not clear who he is or what he has to do with Petra.
Pre-war Czechia is terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a slight decline in the number of attacks, attacks have increased significantly in the last month as we approach the end of the year.
The major campaign involving Agent Tesla was recorded on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted to the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the email is designed to attract the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word invoice in the title, this time it was labeled as Copy of Repair Bill for 11,2021...exe", said Martin Jirkal of Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex email clients.
The malware actively searches for stored logins, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic in late August and September, and with the approach of the holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, the Formbook spyware was also active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November detected more of a global campaign.
The Formbook weakened slightly in November compared to October, but still accounts for almost one fifth of all detections.
The attacks were continuous for a month, with increased activity on November 3rd, 10th, and 15th.
The Formbook most commonly contained an attachment with the .exe extension, which was titled REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
But the name of the receipt keeps coming up.
The Czech appendage can be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
The significant decline and the cooling of activity is noted by security analysts at the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and had no major attack campaign in the Czech Republic in the last few months.
The modern-day demos of smart guys who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated morons.
The march through Prague was bigger than the media is reporting.
Based on the footage of the parade on the waterfront and my experience as a protester, I'm not afraid of an estimated 10,000 people.
The people in the procession filled the embankment and the bridge and the embankment opposite.
That's a lot of people.
The march of some 4,000 demonstrators is spontaneously joined by an unprecedented number of passersby.
I say that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the persistent discontent of several large groups or strata of the population led to their finding a common language.
Only the anti-vaxers, anti-smokers and the like could fill or pay for such a large parade.
The Dead Dogs' campaign is so popular, it reminds me of a million moments for democracy.
Sometimes I get the impression that they're renting the same stage and the same equipment.
It's hard to say what kind of movement could be made out of this discontent, it depends not only on the money supply but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer becomes a four-dose and a multi-dose.
It's definitely not a left-wing or a center-left movement, you bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, because it's obvious that we're going to have to have a re-vaccination every six months.
I'm very glad that the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant feat of science, of which mankind is rightly proud.
The end of the quarrel, Bulgaria has a new Prime Minister who is a herald of change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has appointed the new government of Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption Movement of Continuing Change, which won the November elections.
Tom has already managed to form a broad coalition government that should take office within days.
The country has been in political crisis since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
But the winning parties, which had declared war on bribery and abuse of power, could not agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one's looking?
The secret footage is a global hit.
Concerns have grown in Britain over the weekend over the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been on the run for days by London police.
Petra the deer was last seen two weeks ago driving home from work in the south of the British capital.
The inquiries for the children's hospital worker are being called by police, her former employer and the MP for the London district where she lived.
"Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behavior and we are beginning to worry about it", said Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncova worked, in a video released Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic are also very worried about her and simply want to know where she is", she continued.
Missing Czech reportedly left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28th, and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was last reportedly seen on a bus about a half hour later.
She was reported missing on December 3rd by one of her co-workers.
According to British media, Srnka worked as a nurse's assistant at the Evelyn London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
"We have grave concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing", a group of health facilities tweeted.
We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could help her find her to contact the police, the statement continued.
The amateur painter of children's rooms in Šumper Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also the local pirate councillor) revealed anonymously that she violates copyright with her paintings.
But the court found that the paintings of the Caterpillar in the Sumpter Room do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, there was a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a cover.
It was a life.
The magistrate referred the complaints to the RSD, who owns the road, and because they didn't respond, the hole continued to seep.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the DSB started to deal with the situation intensively.
