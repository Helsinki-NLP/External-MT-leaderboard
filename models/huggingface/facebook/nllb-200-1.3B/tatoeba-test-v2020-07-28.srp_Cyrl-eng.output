Give me another example.
He does not know where he should be.
I'm not going to say anything.
Put the book on the top shelf.
Simplicity is the pinnacle of sophistication.
What does he live on?
What would I do without you?
You are reckless.
That is new.
Please sit down.
Tom gets on my nerves.
They work together.
I will probably never use this again.
You're a human being.
Tom lost his job.

I've never seen Tom so busy.
You seem to be a little out of it lately.
I wonder whose phrase this is.
Tom bought time.
Read this.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember the name.
What did you like most about the trip?
Tom suggested that Mary see a doctor.

You are my sunshine.
She divorced her husband.
I changed my mind.
Based on the information I have given you, what story would you come up with?

When are you running away?
Don't argue with me.
You don't have to shout.

Under what name?
What are you going to do about Tom?
How are you?
Who are you really?
Who is waiting?
I must say, yes.
I want a sword like this.
Tell her about it.
Move slowly.
I will have to change my habits.
Do you speak Latin?
Go back to your room.
Everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests derived from any scientific, literary or artistic work of which he is the author.

I'm the one who pays.
You are a very beautiful woman.
You're a little liar.
I am a teacher.
Where do you live?
Why would I want to kill all of you?
The bathroom is upstairs.
She cared for her son.
We somehow survived.
It seemed to me that Tom was not doing what he was supposed to do.
He suddenly stopped smoking.
I have a cat and a dog. The cat is black, and the dog is white.
Don't thank me.
What is the difference?
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to believe me.
If I love you, what's it to you?
I just got up.
What is the feeling?
My dog is blind, but he likes to go outside and walk.
This is how it was meant to be.
I don't like to work.
My French is shit.
We survived somehow.
The crash.
I'll give you the money tomorrow.
Faith can move mountains.
He was two years younger than I was.
Here are some pictures of her.
Who is your favorite wrestler?

What an honor!
A large number of words are borrowed from foreign languages.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I'm angry with Tom.
What time do you have breakfast?
Because of bad weather, the plane was delayed.
Can I have your dictionary?
I was in a great mood.
Tom is a shrewd man.
Show me the pictures!
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
He is not American, but English.
How do you say Thank you in Japanese?
No one was hurt.
His misfortune taught me much.
Are we ready to go?
Why not?
Tom is tense as a string.
Never lose hope.
It was just a piece of cake.
Choose one.
He got what he wanted.
She drinks like a suck.
They need one another.
Did you report it to the police?
He gave up.
Meet Tom.
After much deliberation, I finally made things at random.
You are absolutely right.
Tom is ruthless.
Termites eat wood.
You have failed me.
What is this?
I'm happy to be here.
That was very good.
She takes care of her aged mother.
That cannot be true.
Tom looked left and right before crossing the street.
Go straight ahead.
Just like a bean.
It is empty.
Where did you get that idea?
Maria nodded.
I'm giving up.
I can't sit still.
Happy Easter!
I owe you an apology.
Which way are you going?
Please read between the lines.
I had lunch at speed.
Wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
I almost forgot my passport.
Why are you doing this, if I may ask?
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Give an example.
What's tomorrow?
Can you give an example?
Tom drinks like a sucker.
Is that what you want?
That doesn't sound like you.
I look, but I don't see.
We are close friends.
Tom was completely drunk.
How many people live on earth?
You may have it.
If I love you, what's it to you?
Peter is in love with Jane.
Is this a real diamond?
Are you free tonight?
I love watching you play.
They have replaced coal with oil.
It was snowing.
How can I say that in your language?
That is not a good sign.
I didn't tell him you were here.
I'm glad to see you again.
Why are you acting this way?
He does not miss anything.
We live in the atomic age.
Mary makes a living as a seamstress.
Where will Tom sleep?
Did you get enough sleep last night?
That was not the only reason I left Mary.
"Do you have a nickname?" "Yes, Rick".
Today, I am not doing anything.
This is Brian Rock.
Two boys ran out of the room.
It is never too late to learn.
First, we must find them.
Tom was very frightened.
It is snowing.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Tom looked very different after the bottle.
Tom gets on my nerves.
I'm learning now.
When did you get home?
He asked for help.
This is not true.
I took the first step.
Can You Keep a Secret?
I nodded once.
Do not waste words.
Did you do it on purpose?
Do not be upset.
Tom is living proof that you don't have to be smart to be successful.
This is a good textbook.
How long have you been a teacher?
Do you think I should write to Tom?
We ran out of the building.
I'm a beginner. I'm not a beginner.
This tea is good.
Cover your mouth when you cough, sneeze, or sneeze.
I bought this yesterday.
Do you speak Greek?
Everything was happening at the speed of light.
What's your story?
I annoyed him.
I pretended not to see.
I tried to be kind.
I'm not going in there.
The success was only partial.
I'm not 100% sure.
I didn't tell her you were here.
The fuse burned.
I didn't tell him you were here.
We protested peacefully.
Mary was furious as a rice.
Turn left.
Don't be shouting!
I know as much as you do.
I can resist anything but temptation.
I paid for it.
Did you bring a fan?
You are under oath.
I wish I knew.
I don't believe that.
Are you looking for something specific?
Do not worry!
Caroline is sad because she cannot conceive.
I took off my wig.
That's my cat.
It's right there.
He is known as a great painter.
Why are you angry with me?
What is your name in Bosnian?
Tom traveled on the legendary Orient Express from Paris to Istanbul.
The forbidden fruit is always the sweetest.
I'm going to go.
What is all this fuss about?
I don't understand why they're so good friends.
This is a book.
The bedroom is upstairs.
What's wrong with you?
She hated him.
What will you do today?
Taxis are expensive.
Logic is obviously your strong suit.
I would like to kiss you.
He told me I was cute.
My father is too old to work.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
You are absolutely right.
You changed my life.
He ran away from her.
The bird on the roof is a crow.
How do I call a taxi?
You didn't answer the question.
He was bare-chested and bare-chested.
I can ski.
Why do you think so?
It is snowing today.
Today I have a headache.
I think Tom pulled the thick end.
I'll do my homework tomorrow.
By the way, where do you live?
The office door is yellow.
Dad, can you read me a story before I go to bed?
I have many friends.
This is not exactly what I wanted.
Is it yours?
The house is made of brick.
They all lie.
I took the first step.
Would you like some fruit juice?
Can you help us?
Stay calm. I'm not going to lie.
One day it will be mine.
I've had enough of everything!
It was terrible.
I won't let you do that.
How was your French class?
Keep your head up.
I annoyed him.
Is Breakfast Included in the Price?
Is everything okay between us?
What can I say?
Her name was unknown.
Where's my room?
In our vast world, there are countless lifestyles, languages, and cultures.
We have a serious problem.

At this stage in world history, there is no such thing as an independent press in America. You know that, and I know that. There is not one of you who dares to write his honest opinion, and if he did write it, he would know in advance that it would never appear in the press. I was paid my regular salary to keep my honest opinion out of the newspaper I work for. Many of you are also paid similarly for similar things, and any of you who were crazy enough to write what you honestly think would be out on the street looking for some other job. If I had allowed my honest opinion to appear in just one issue of the newspaper I work for, I would have been fired from my job in less than 24 hours. (...)

Man has many desires that he does not really want to realize, and it would be wrong to assume otherwise. He wants them to remain desires; they have value only in his imagination; their realization would be a bitter disappointment to him. Such a desire is also the desire for eternal life.
