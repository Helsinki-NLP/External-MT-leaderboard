The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, a total of 29 percent
The significant weakening of the two sides of the so far major coalition and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought, according to the first preliminary results, Sunday's early parliamentary elections in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) has suffered severe losses, where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molter, is seriously shocked.
On the contrary, the Electoral Leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Croatian hejtman Jörg Haider is planning a triumphal return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, it remains the strongest party in the country of Social Democracy (SPÖ) with 29.8 percent of the votes, but against the last 2006 elections it loses 5.5 percent of the votes.
Even worse was the ÖVP, which lost with 25.6 percent almost nine percent of the votes.
These are the worst results of both of these great parties in the Austrian post-war history, and especially for the people who caused early elections, a literally catastrophic result.
Even at the beginning of July, when ÖVP left the coalition, the people had a significant advance in preferences over the SPÖ.
But the voters clearly punished them for leaving the government to break down.
In the early reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party’s chairman and former vice chancellor Wilhelm Molter.
The observers estimate that this could happen on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the party’s chairman.
Such developments would apparently facilitate the way to the increasingly likely outcome from the election result, i.e. to the restoration of the large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
Due to the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties – the Free Party (FPÖ) obtained temporarily 18 percent and the BZÖ eleven percent of the votes – however, the Social Democrats at the same time expressed concerns about the repetition of 1999, when the populists agreed with the populists (at that time the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) on a joint government, which even caused sanctions by the European Union.
This development is obviously a bet on Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and predicts a return to Vienna in national policy.
The Party of the Greens was still in parliament, but it was slightly lost and fell from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties obviously crossed the four-percent limit and did not reach the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India May Be Cold
If it failed to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who were accused in India of illegally collecting brushes, the Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs Karl Schwarzenberg said there would be a certain cooling of the Czech-India relations.
The minister said this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherji.
"If it wasn't solved, then yes, then a certain cooling would happen," he said after a meeting held on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the meeting that the executive power could be difficult to interfere in judicial matters.
However, he said that in the case of Peter Šváchy, who was released from the charges and punished by a fine, the central government may negotiate with the local government in Dárdžiling, in whose jurisdiction the case falls.
“Their problem could be solved,” the minister said.
For Emile Kucher sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best for Mukherjee to refer to a higher instance.
He may then ask for release on caution and wait for his sentence, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner said the same during the talks.
“He recommends appeal to the Supreme Court, then it would be possible to apologize him,” the head of the Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech party can enter the whole matter is to provide the convicted with "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
He also said that the Indian government is already providing such assistance.
“We are very interested inining the best relations with India that have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize this,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as CTK said, he emphasized before his partner that the Czech Republic attributes a great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We really consider it a deep mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists,” he said.
The answer to the question whether he was given a promise from the Indian party to deal with the matters, the minister avoided.
“I’ve got quite a lot of promises,” he said.
Czechs Judge the Battle of the Sea
It will access the wall electronic map, which shows Australia and its adjacent sea areas.
He is not interested in the continent, but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
The island belongs to Australia and, along with it, the adjacent sea bottom.
The area is as large as the continent itself,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, a 30-member team of UN Division for Oceans and Maritime Affairs.
His head, director of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, the interpretation is monitored and sometimes supplemented.
There is work and enthusiasm.
The sea bottom hides a little known world, rich in natural resources.
You can find oil, minerals and other mineral raw materials, but also unknown living organisms, which carry the key to develop a drug against cancer.
Larger than the land.
The coastal states have now begun to demand for a new submarine territory.
According to the United Nations Convention, the United Nations rights are exercised as agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the so-called continental shelf area, which often stretches up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
According to the Convention, it has exclusive right to all continental shelf resources.
Simply understood, the continental shelf is the part of the sea bottom and its ground, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It lies beyond the coastal sea, often beyond the two hundred sea miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” Mikulka explains.
The request that the country submits to the Commission for the determination of the external boundaries of the continental shelf must be proven by comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on numerous expensive surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
“One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and professional technical assistance.
The Commission has so far discussed five applications, including Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three countries have succeeded so far,” Mikulka adds.
The world recorded the recent success of Australia, which was the first to significantly expand its underwater holdings.
The area of the sea floor, which the Commission granted to him last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, which is about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The profits that they will get from the use of the sea floor in the future will be, as they promise, invaluable.
Other countries will gradually submit their applications.
They can do so up to ten years from the moment they ratified the “Montego Bay Agreement”.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean bottom begins, a convention declared "the common heritage of mankind".
No country has an exclusive position.
The right of mining in this area is granted by the international institution established by the Convention.
“The sea bottom is not a Klondajk,” says Mikulka in the excess with the fact that his “individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regime contractually stipulated.”
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the sea is currently part of the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other states of the former Eastern Block within the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, according to the Convention, as well as the investors of a few other states, it gained the status of the so-called "progressive investor".
It has a license to harvest in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific, located between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area surveyed by investors is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is sealed there, it is a kind of submarine replica of Tater.
"There can be exploited on an area of a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich place of polymetal concrete containing nickel, copper, kobalt and manganese," said another lawyer Ind Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian division worker Robert Sandev brings one such concrete to the show.
It reminds a little potato or, with a little fantasy, a fairy shame that, according to the legend, revived Golem.
German Special Enforcement Forces Release the Rape
The Egyptian government has asked for aid from Germany to resolve the crisis with hostages - experts have arrived.
When the situation worsened, the special units were prepared, but the operation was not done.
The public is gradually getting further details of the circumstances of the liberation of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defense and the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to the ministries, at the place of liberation were both the experts of the Federal Army and members of the anti-terrorist group of the German police GSG9, the aircraft of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and also logistics experts from the Technisches Hilfswerk Service.
According to a further statement from the two ministries on Monday afternoon, however, the German forces were not needed because the kidnappers allowed their prisoners to go and fled when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government said the aid offered by Germany was accepted as a support force for the action on the site.
“Happyly it did not happen,” said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
Attackers kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanians and eight of their Egyptian guides on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After the kidnapping in the desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostages moved in the border territories between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as details about the release or possible ransom payments.
The rescue is now in order in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said the kidnappers are in the care of the German Embassy.
He did not comment on the details of his release.
There is no information on when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, all five tourists should also with special forces depart by one Airbus of the German Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Rejected Rescue Package
The first Chamber of the U.S. Congress has laid down a $700 billion financial market rescue package.
The Dow Jones Index has dropped.
In a ratio of 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's rescue package for financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of U.S. President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both sides, the majority did not find a program to mitigate the chaos in the financial markets.
With a dramatic action, the supporters desperately tried to convince the criticism of a $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called for a parliament before the vote to give consent, although, as he said, the plan is not popular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened,” he said.
Even during the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason was the concerns of investors that the state rescue package could fall.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the index’s value was raised, so that after the announcement of the breakdown of the package again dropped sharply.
Experts are now expecting further serious turbulences on the international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, it requires the approval of the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Travel agencies report increasing number of reservations
It seems that the winter will be good for German tourism entrepreneurs:
According to one study, the turnover has increased significantly in reservations for the next months compared to the previous year – even over 30 percent in the winter season.
Despite the weak economic growth, the desire of the Germans to travel remains unsuccessful.
For winter reservations, travel agencies a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the same period last year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) on Monday in Berlin.
According to a survey by the GfK Institute for Market Research, there are already increased number of reservations available for the autumn months.
The turnover was thus, according to the DRV’s statement for October, about 11 percent higher compared to 2007.
The basis for these results are the numbers of GfK, which every month evaluates the reservations data from 1200 German travel agencies and interpolates them to the overall market.
This result included the reservations of trips that took place by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar rate, travel to the U.S. is demanded, DRV said.
For these routes, the increase in reservations is about one-third.
In addition, Germany’s main targets are Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as domestic water.
First of all, organized trips are in the course, DRV Chairman Klaus Laepple said.
Given the rising energy and food expenditure, there are costs "for the client hardly countable than for individually organized holidays".
Laepple explained that money can be saved by consumers, among other things, by using discounts for timely booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations was said to be very good, so a higher turnover will be recorded again compared to the previous year – although according to another study, the number of Germans who took some journey has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Unfinished repeated popcorn, beer from taps and prominences in cuts from famous designers.
For the first time in the beer.
Susanne Kronzucker and I have nothing to do with.
She’s a blond, a TV moderator and wears a suitable coat.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is from secondhand.
But one thing connects us: we’re not even three minutes on the beer plate, and the photographers are throwing on us, and the memory cards are filled with a bit – that’s a lot of trouble, because I’m on the Oktoberfest for the first time.
This is how you can get friends.
It seems that my cheap cutting has fulfilled its purpose.
I am here as a tourist and I live north of the clobass equator, so my feeling of comfort in the crossing was rather limited.
But immediately after arriving at Theresienwiese, everything was better than it thought.
Almost everyone wears a female cut or leather pants; no one looks disappointed or shyly touched - everything is completely normal.
A special look at the banana stand in chocolate is only gathered by my stone.
One Munich woman warns me that I had wrongly bound her: “You are free on the left, on the middle a virgin, on the right, on the back a shepherd.”
They are hiding the mails from the back to the left.
“Well,” he says and laughs.
Others with subtle flirting techniques do not deal so much, and they wear simple folded hats with the inscription "To drunk to get dressed!" and pull out on the passing naked ass.
A young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is named Bob, he is from England and at the Oktoberfest he also came for the first time.
He looks “gorgeous”, with a prolonged “ooa”.
He tells me that after he was just drunk.
Just next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks they’re a waste basket.
Bob is, therefore, one of the feared "Wildbiesler", as it is called in the public freely urinating people in Bavaria.
Others have the luck to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around the eighth of the evening they run around the square where the Oktoberfest is held, heavily healthcare professionals who have to take care of poor drunkers.
Medical professionals always appear in the heads - in four they wear covered cartridges from the tent to the tent.
They work as the majority of the visitors of the beer bar: empty there, full again back.
Who lies under the placht of this cage of promile is not seen.
"It's just you who can't go on," one of the healthcare professionals calls me in response to my question and disappears in the crowd.
Police reveal the victim's name
The name of a 36-year-old woman, who died in a hospital after a car crashed her in Essex, was published.
The accident on the Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon hit Carole Paulson from the Chelmsford Road.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 15-year-old man was arrested for suspicion of disguise.
He was released by police guarantee.
Turkish diplomatic horizons are expanding
Long before Turkey began attempting to join the European Union, European powers wanted to penetrate deeply into the Turkish interference.
On the eastern coast of Bosphorus, just twenty steps in Asia, stands one of the best monuments of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpaša railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neorenesan style.
This is what the tourist guide will tell you.
The building sits round at the end of the successor with a tower on every corner of the corner, with a view to the uncertainty from some provincial German municipality.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly broken down.
But as soon as a person gets into the curved treasury, he can no longer have a doubt about the size of the company, whose most western gateway the station was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German Consortium Anatoly-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, which took part in the game of the empires late, intended to realize its ambition to control the Middle East using this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and further to the territory that is today Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
Their cools were attacked by Lawrence from Arabia and his irregular troops.
Relative isolation from the surrounding territories, arising from the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone
British and colonial troops came from Egypt and pushed out the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
And for the Hydarpaša station also came bad news.
In 1917, an explosion of the ammunition train destroyed the roof.
Turkish sources say it was a sabotage.
Since then, it has gradually broken down and history has gone away.
But today this gateway to Anatolia and further to the east serves – at least symbolically – to emphasize the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from the surrounding territories, arising from the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
Now a new policy is being implemented – Turkey is engaged.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To review the parameters of this new policy, I sat on a night train to the Turkish capital Ankara, where I had to meet with one of the leading AKP foreign policy experts, the Turkish deputy Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning – about ten and a half hours later – after a crazy ride on the roads that reminded the ancient world rhythms of the famous document Night Post, I arrived in a Turkish metropolitan, designed as a new city for a secular state who wants to turn his back to his Ottoman past.
However, AKP with its well-known Islamist roots represents a shift in the paradigm of Turkish consensus.
In the West, it raised suspicion, especially in Washington.
A taxi brought me to the main AKP tent, an ultramodern stone and metal building, deliberately built on the emerging suburbs, surrounded by half-developed shopping houses and power-to-power shops, where middle managers in business clothes - men and women - meet to make early morning shops.
Suat Kiniklioglu could peacefully be a middle-right politician from almost any other European political party.
I’m sure I’ve got a blackberry, I’m sure I’ve got a blackberry.
“The goal of the party’s foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its nearest environment.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey was cut off from its blockade.
Today we have to look both to the east and to the west at the same time.
It was not a choice.
He had to do both.
“But there will be a time,” I asked, “when will Turkey have to decide?”
“Turkey,” he said, “will not have such a decision to be made.”
He then emphasized what almost everyone with whom I talked here said almost in memory: the Turkish relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea surroundings are as well to the benefit of Europe and the United States as of Turkey.
With Turkey on board it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically, go through these routes to the east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back to the Hydarpaša station, after another mostly awake night, I thought of the two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Con, who watched how this building was built a hundred years ago.
How would they be surprised if they discovered that the European ambitions in the Middle East can now be, in substantial part, in the Turkish hands.
And when I was in the port waiting for the trail back through the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe."
So it seems that at least then there was no doubt which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Memorial Life: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a Guildford musical leader since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (Necrologist, September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Corps.
As part of the district music plan, a year for it was founded by a great group of young Proteus.
He had to be up to 21 years old, but at the time Proteus singed for the last time in 1979, some of us were almost 30 - we simply refused to give up that group.
The name "Proteus" represented the willingness and ability of the church to engage in any music that was presented to him - whether it was madrigaly or Messiaen, whether it was independently or with the entire orchestra.
The music adaptability created by such a young body was often amazing, always exciting and all thanks to the inspiration of that single man and the enthusiasm for music that remained completely unchanged all the time.
How often only Tod told us to “lat the music speak for ourselves.”
He said, “The composer knows what he wants.
It’s all in that music.
So sing it!”
His tactical technique was absolutely clear and accurate, but it was neither dictatorial nor flowerful.
Whatever the musical standard was, he always raised it up.
John Frayn Turner says:
If any dirigent had to be passed on the Knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades when he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past about 40 years I’ve reviewed more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never been disappointed by any of them – and many times I’ve been inspired.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal humility.
He hated the dirigents who, according to his words, simply "treated one or two scattered spots around the world."
Many of us will be missing.
by William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett says:
Your necrologist William Woodruff (25 September) claims that "in 1946 he returned to the economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... while studying at BSc, MA and PhD."
This is based on Woodruff's commentary by the author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953, he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he made a thesis on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a publication British rubber industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is unknown why Woodruff passed this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philosophical Faculty
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resina 'Flamenco and Life', because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
They pushed me with the simplicity and the strong burden with which they act on the audience, and with the carefulness and respect for the photographers.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino can capture magical moments.
Honda to attack its bestseller for the second time
In November, Honda will start the sale of the second generation of the Jazz.
If the predecessor of this one-space vehicle already had considerable space, it now offers even more spacious interior.
This is accompanied by improved engines that increase driving comfort and allow greater fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although from aesthetic point of view, the new Jazz lines are very similar to the previous model, many changes have occurred on this one-space car.
It is important to mention, for example, innovative design, a new platform, greater dimensions and new engines.
Even before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes on the market six years after the launch of the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we will notice is the fact that Honda needed a shorter period to rejuvenate this model than other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is a less known model, it has become a phenomenon in sales in other markets.
This is the case of Japan, the country where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002, and also during this year in 2008.
In Japan, almost a million pieces have been sold since the launch of the Honda Jazz.
The second market became the old continent with approximately half a million units sold in six years.
However, Honda seeks the new Jazz to increase sales in its category.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Honda Jazz units, in 2009 estimates 100,000 cars, which would mean a 17% increase in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz models since 2002, which is 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2,000 units throughout the year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
The leadership of the automotive company is de facto expecting the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 less than in 2007 and a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its share in the Spanish market to 1.8 percent, compared to 1.6 percent last year.
In 2010, the Japanese company is expected to reach 2%.
To this share, Honda is relying on the success of its next new model.
It is Honda Insight, a compact-size five-door hybrid with a length of 4.37 meters, from which the Japanese company promises global sales of approximately 200,000 units per year.
As for markets, the Japanese manufacturer estimates that 50% of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided into the old continent and Japan.
The Honda Insight sales are expected to begin in the first months of next year, as soon as it will be presented to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has increased all dimensions.
Its length increased to 3.9 meters (five centimeters more), width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and axis gap to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
The height, on the contrary, has not changed and is still 1.52 meters.
As a result of the increase, the internal space has also increased.
This advantage was achieved by the use of the new platform, and by the storage of the fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was used in the previous Honda Jazz.
Also, the volume of the baggage space - which has a double bottom system - increased to 399 liters, 19 liters more than the volume of the baggage space in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in the 1.4 engine version, as the baggage space in Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Another improvement in addition to the external elements - such as the back LED lights or the possibility of equipping a glass panoramic roof - is easier access to the back seats.
The doors leading to the second series of seats allow an opening angle of 80 degrees compared to 67 for the first Jazz model.
The second generation of Honda Jazz has new engines.
From the beginning, this small model will be offered with two 1.2 and 1.4 litre gasoline engines.
Both engines use the i-VTEC technology, which allows lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions, and brings excellent improvements to the fuel system while with high rotation momentum in the full range of engine spins.
The first 1.2 litre engine has a power of 90 hp at 6,000 spins with a maximum momentum of 114 Nm at 4 900 spins.
This engine - which had 78 horses for the previous generation of the Jazz car - has a 5.3 litre consumption and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which at the previous generation reached 83 hp, the current will reach 100.
The 100 hp Honda Jazz 1.4 has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
"Auto Bee" prevents crashes
To the advances in the development of accident protection technologies, this time Nissan was inspired by nature, specifically in the bees.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes the model of flying bees and thus prevents crashes.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C, which is the first step in collapse prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Center for Technical Advancement Nissan Motor Co. Robot developed in cooperation with the Center for Advancement in Scientific and Technological Research the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhir Doie, Chief Public Relations Officer for Brand Technology, Research and Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of the four zones of the Nissan Security Shield.
The robot’s task is to strengthen the ability to prevent crashes in the cars of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
The most important, however, are complex bee eyes, which are able to see in all directions in an angle greater than 300 degrees, allowing the bee to fly in their personal space without stopping.
When creating this visual function, engineers designed what they called a laser Range Finder (Laser Range Finder).
It records obstacles that are up to a distance of two meters in a 180-degree circuit before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the board microprocessor, which immediately converts it to a collision warning.
“When a barrier is recorded, the robot will imitate the bees’ movements and immediately change the direction by turning the wheels to the right or even greater corner to prevent collisions.
The greatest difference from any existing system is the fact that all offshore maneuveres are completely instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobile Laboratory and Chief Engineer of the project.
Unlike the bees, a robot cannot move up and down either diagonally, its movement is limited to two dimensions and to the direction it is allowed by turning its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities like the bees.
In addition to acceleration and slowing, Nissan has also used the rotation function to prevent collisions.
“The device only needs to process the information every few seconds and according to this data to beined.
It does not require the preservation of information or logical intuition from previous maneuveres, thus it can work without interruption with just two dozen kB of memory.
You may be surprised, but in memory we don’t talk about giga or mega.”
This is the first step in the development of new technology for immediate crash prevention, the technology for which Nissan predicts use in serial cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the integration of the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead drivers to the target while avoiding obstacles on the road.
Be afraid before you take a mortgage.
It should be recognised that the U.S. Department of Finance, in addition to having enough capital to distribute injections, does not lack even inventiveness.
Facing the crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgages from banks with doubtful solvency, they created a popular-scientific game "Bad Credit Hotel" on the Internet.
It’s not a bad hotel or a bad hotel.
The hotel, and especially its reception rooms, look cloudy to make a person once, twice and three times think about whether it’s the right time to apply for a loan.
And above all where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, although not too detailed.
This site is more suitable for the youth than a space for the entire public.
What happens when the game is over?
There is a dream room inside the hotel.
At least something, because of the purchase of a house rather not to talk about...
Morgan Stanley opens MUFG capital
The Morgan Stanley bank announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank, will spend nine billion dollars to gain 21% of its capital.
A week after they revealed their preliminary agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG intends to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s current shares at a single price of $25.25, which is a total revenue of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19% lower than the accounting value of securities on 31 August.
MUFG invests another $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities, which will provide it with a 10% return and a exchange price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley explained that the entire transaction will be based on the average single price of $29, which is 28% below its current rate.
Morgan Stanley shares dropped 6.79% and reached $23,07 around Greenwich time.
“This strategic merger is an important opportunity on the way to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to the status of a bank holding,” said John Mack, CEO of the U.S. Group.
The new statut was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, allowing him to diversify his activities, while placing him under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His unification with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest ass of Wall Street to take a far more cautious approach than before.
The terms presented on Monday show, among other things, that the agreement has been amended over the past few days: last Monday Morgan only announced that it will sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
“Even a week ago we thought,” explained Tošihide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG in Tokyo, “that our participation will consist exclusively of regular shares.
However, taking into account the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to reduce risks to a minimum and also cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay for Morgan Stanley securities 7% less than their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a reduction of the profit from the stock by about 20%.
The agreement assumes that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into regular shares within a year if the latter will be exchanged for a certain period of time at a price of 50% above the exchange rate, i.e. at approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that MUFG will bring will allow him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his cash.
However, the group's spokesman refused to provide detailed information about the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to have a Tier One payability ratio of around 15%, which is one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had reduced his balance “sensitively” since the end of August.
The last weeks have been challenging for the group as its stock exchange rate has fallen by half, while insurance costs against the risk of non-payment associated with debt have grown sharply.
The costs on Monday took the opposite, but remained high, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" from the major investment banks of Wall Street after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the Merrill Lynch acquisition, announced that it had picked up $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warrena Buffett group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
Re-establish a republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chavez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuador Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third appointed submitted a proposal for a new constitution to vote, according to the pattern of his counterparts and friends.
And his mission is fulfilled, as 64% of voters, according to the official results covering 80% of the votes, voted yes in the referendum.
According to the results, 28 percent of the votes were invalid and 0.7 percent of the votes were empty.
In order to adopt the draft constitution, he had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
Two surveys carried out at the east of the election rooms and a non-governmental organization’s estimate forecasted a clear “yes” victory on Sunday, ranging between 63 % and 70 %.
In the night of Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa demanded the victory of his draft Constitution.
"The Constitution won on the whole line," he assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians at the headquarters of the Guayaquil Governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quita.
He understands himself that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chavez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the Observatory Mission of the United States (OEA), took place quietly, concerned the text on 444 points building the "new socialism" promoted by the president.
The proposal of the Constitution sanctifies the power of the state over the economy by reserving it the “development planning” of the country living primarily from the oil mining by foreign companies and from the currencies that its emigrants send.
The proposal protected by Correou, which was elected in 2006, also expands the powers of the head of state, which will be able to perform two consecutive four-year mandates and will be able to dissolve the parliament.
Correa has already announced that it will exercise this power and will apply for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution, among other things, strengthens the principle of free healthcare and education, which the president began to introduce in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty limit.
Finally, it also counts to ban the presence of foreign troops, thus terminating the agreement between Washington and Quit on the use of the Ecuador base as the starting point for U.S. drug operations.
19 guests were released in Chad.
The Egyptian command attacked the kidnappers of 11 tourists and their eight-member accompanying who were captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were detained for ten days in the desert, were lived and transferred to the Egyptian capital on Monday.
In the morning, the Egyptian command liberated them in Chad.
Rukojmi arrived around 15.30, apparently in good shape, on board a special aircraft to the al-Maza military base, close to the international airport in Cairo.
They were immediately taken, without having the opportunity to express themselves in the press, on board a helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, the border residential district of Cairo, to be subjected to medical examinations there.
"They are completely healthy" and "the kidnappers were not paid any ransom," Egyptian tourist minister Zohejr Garrana said on the airport's road.
Since his imprisonment on September 19 during a safari car with all four wheels on the foot of Mount Uanat, on the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages has been trapped from one hostage to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romania - and also eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border manager of the agency Aegyptous, the organizer of the safari.
A senior representative of the Egyptian security forces suggested that 30 members of the special units, who approached the site on board two helicopters, landed on the staircase during the night just before the Dawn.
"There was a shooting, half of the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," the source said, who wanted to remain anonymous.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian Special Forces from the "Flash" unit were sent to Sudan, where they got the support of German and Italian commands.
Italian diplomacy chief Franco Frattini from Belgrade, where he is currently located, mentioned the role played by secret agents and components of the Italian Special Forces.
“We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of people from our secret services, from special forces,” he said without further clarification.
He also denied that the ransom would be paid.
In the evening, the Sudanese army said it had arrested a car with all four wheels on board which had kidnappers, killing six of them, including the Chad Commander, and arresting two.
The army claimed that they were connected to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement - Unity (SLA-U), which the said movement immediately rejected.
Posts - Silent majority of the culture resort
The debate on the financing of culture fills the pages of the newspapers with inch titles and is the topic of the current pre-election campaign.
Better the better.
However, one aspect of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise to scatter the poor amounts that are provided to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national monuments that fall hungry?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that they are ignoring their monuments and their historic buildings?
That in Quebec, like in Canada, we have no laws that would really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros to restore the only Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
For our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, by all elected representatives and by all regional organizations, in cooperation.
In Quebec, in the Quebec Federation of Society for History, at least 40,000 volunteers united to 211 Society for History, Monuments, Archives and Genetics strive to uncover history, preserve a set of private archives and protect archaeological remains for a couple of tiny.
Often these societies are the guard dogs of our monuments, who are driven by hopelessness protesting when promoters and leaders throw out their bulldosers on old stones and forgotten cemetery.
When will we finally get to the tribune for history and monuments?
Government Benelux State Part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states will help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to get into trouble due to the expanding impact of the U.S. mortgage market, by partial nationalization: the three countries will support the monetary and insurance institution, which has a capital share also in Hungary, with an amount of €11.2 billion.
This agreement was reached this weekend at the highest level by the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
The Fortis Bank is the first in the euro area to come into a major crisis in the context of the international financial market crisis, which has been spreading over a year, and the decisions made in this matter could in a certain sense be considered as precedents.
In the sense of the decision, which was born on Sunday night, all three states will recover almost half (49 percent) of the bank’s assets.
The bank with absolute certainty will sell part of its capital shares, especially after - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Fortis’ shares began to decline sharply last week, with serious signs of crisis appearing in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to let it fail.
The company’s securities fell by 12 percent on Friday, to a 14 year minimum.
Since January, the share value has dropped by more than two-thirds.
Due to the current stock prices, the group’s total market capital is around 14 billion euros, but it is unrealistic according to the company’s leaders.
The company’s leadership, on the other hand, accuses the fall of Fortis’ shares of uncertainty in the overseas market associated with the acceptance of a $700 billion package plan.
On Monday, the stock increased slightly.
On Friday, the new CEO of the bank, Filip Dierckx, was appointed to the head of the bank.
The monetary institution was also looking for private buyers, but with a more serious offer so far no one has registered.
The Belgian government has previously announced that investors do not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
There was no panic among the clients of the bank and the branches were not taken by the attack.
In Hungary, the Fortis bank has a separate branch and has also purchased several leasing companies.
Sheep in the chicken
Life and health insurance companies in America on the basis of the data of people about the purchase of drugs often refuse the possibility of concluding an insurance contract with the applicant.
Data protection experts are concerned that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that links the use of the prescription data in any case to the permission of the person concerned.
It must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we will entrust the chicken to the lush,” said Richard Dick, the author of the program for monitoring the prescription of drugs.
Insurance companies make the insurance fees and amounts paid in the event of insurance events dependent on the health status of the interested, and if the risk is assessed as too large, they do not even close the insurance with it.
Previously, they sent them for medical examinations and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: on the basis of the identification number, the customer from the pharmacies can easily find out what medicines the person has purchased in the last year and a half, from which the program itself will find out what he is suffering from the disease and what his health is.
For example, if you regularly buy a large amount of cholesterol reduction medications, this means that you have practically uncontrollably high blood fat levels, which will immediately place you in a higher risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some determine the risk coefficient at the same time, so the insurance company, in addition to papering, has almost no work left, although small difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include that leckter drugs can also be used for several purposes, some compounds are, for example, applicable against migraine or heat waves, but they are also effective against depression.
These constitute a significant risk increasing factor from the point of view of commercial insurance companies, while the first difficulties are not.
For the purpose of requesting and processing the data, special companies have been established, which, before providing the necessary information from the pharmacies, ask the patient for permission.
They are already forced to do so by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their previous negligence.
Some companies have recently been processing the results of laboratory examinations, which link with the data on the drugs used, which allows them to provide a even more accurate picture of the patient’s health.
More and more companies have access to data, and the control of their use will become more and more difficult.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effectiveness applies only to health service providers and insurance companies.
The draft law, which will authorize the authorities to control companies specializing in data provision, is before the Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: therefore, he developed his program so that the transmission of data is bound to the explicit consent of the person concerned.
The other thing is that the authorization may hardly be rejected, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with it.
So the chickens are somewhat referred to in a goodwill.
Global Marseille Menu
EU and India will double trade turnover
Since the European Union and India are one of the leading trade partners, this topic, in addition to other, mostly global issues, also dominated the agenda of the Ninth Summit at the highest level.
Today will also be held a French-India summit, which will focus on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
Indeed, the European Union acknowledges that India is a developing democratic power that should be given a greater opportunity to speak in international affairs, but the Member States have not yet managed to find a common nominator on the issue of supporting New Delhi’s permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
This issue was not further discussed at the yesterday, already ninth summit, held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy as the current EU chairman, European Commission chairman José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed that the trade turnover in five years will double, or increase to more than a hundred billion euros.
Since the exchange of goods increased from 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an excessively ambitious goal.
As a sign of this, twenty-six already existing bilateral agreements on civil aviation with India have been harmonised from a legal point of view, so the future will also be green for air transport.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the EU.
Sarkozy has promised negotiations will be accelerated.
The goal is to balance the balance, while the EU is India’s first trade partner, New Delhi is ranked ninth among EU partners.
The summit also focused on global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, respectively, terrorism - both sides in all its forms condemned and called for an urgent convocation of the UN conference.
They also urged the end of the round of trade negotiations from Doha, although both have a large part of its previous failure.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate program, namely that it would like to reduce harmful emissions by at least twenty percent by 2020.
India also agreed to this, as well as to the need for a global agreement to be concluded at the next year’s climate conference and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
Both sides would also wish to prevent food prices from rising and support the convocation of an international conference to analyze the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India arrives today in the French capital, where he is planning to close a negotiation on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that the powers for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors worth twenty billion euros will be obtained by French companies.
According to the agency reports, the agreement would be valid for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Great participation of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred different countries to take 171,790 square meters of the exhibition with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as an honorary guest.
Vice Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inauguration ceremony in the Italian Pavilion: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – on 264 square meters of exhibition area.
It will follow a press meeting in the Room Struktur Buchmesse in Pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present the numbers, trends and perspectives regarding the state of the publishing company in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors is increasingly reduced in relation to the overall Italian production, mainly due to literature for children and adults.
Steve Fossetta, a millionaire missing a year ago
The remainder of the plane was found by Steve Fossetta, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying over the desert in Nevada.
The ruins were discovered on one upper plane at a height of three thousand meters, in the Mammoth Lakes area in Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
But there were no human remains inside the plane.
Sheriff Madera County, John Anderson, dissolved the doubts that remained: "The aircraft was found, we sent a team there and now we are sure it's exactly where Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff said there were no human remains found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) announced that a few hours after the detection of the ruins was sent an investigation team that eventually identified the aircraft: it is exactly the Bellanca 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett left Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, near the Nevada border, some Fossett's personal objects were found by one pair near their homes in the Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, about cash and one jacket.
Fossetta's search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire has gained a place in history thanks to a long collection of championships.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the journey around the world in an air balloon: two weeks of flight alone.
Three years later he travelled around the world in a plane and without landing.
His many records include a flight at an altitude of 15,445 meters, above the Andes, though with a copilot.
Advertising that you don’t expect
One unusual Suv with original design and accurately defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with accurate corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk from the “compact” Jeeps of the Star House, using which Mercedes-Benz has tried to bring a viral of news into that sector.
It is due to its non-traditional processing that the communications will be unexpected and unconventional, which will accompany the introduction of the Suv Glk on the market and which will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from the coming October 17.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which will accompany the debut of the new vehicle, will launch an informal way of communication also thanks to the futuristic 3D poster campaign, which is the first time used in Italy for the car brand.
The maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will dominate the main Milan business class, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication begins with the introduction of the car in stereoscopic vision and using special glasses that will be distributed near Corsa Como, the new Suv will be possible to see in almost real dimensions and in a three-dimensional format.
Indeed, when you look at the picture, you will have the impression that the car will go out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different moments in all its little things, so that it will then re-compose into a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical area of automotive communications with this advertisement.
Will he be able to raise the interest of future customers?
We know who the Italians are.
From Trivenet, they risk Daspo.
They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been watching Nazionale azzurra for years and which so far, in truth, has never made excessive problems.
He never met the opponent’s fans.
The group’s orientation is right.
The founders are from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padova, Tersta and Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact few) from Campania and Puglia joined them.
They have three-colored flags, on which the cities of origin of the participants appear: on Saturday evening they were removed so that they were not recognized.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they found real Nazi fans, Levsky.
Figc made available to Italian fans 144 tickets per match: all by name, thus easy to check.
And Viminale actually checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Dasla, no one to whom it would be prohibited to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans who had previous violations from the stadium were rejected and the match was banned.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports that will come from the Bulgarian police, then it will take action: In this case it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years to fans who were arrested or those who were identified during the outbreak.
The International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our chuligans, in short, no longer go to a single stadium.
to luck.
But now there is fear of emulation: that is, more than one hundred and fifty will be added.
“We have to immediately shut down this fire and not justify those who behave in this way,” Viminal said.
So, "really open eyes, especially because of the national match on Wednesday in Lechi."
It is in Puglia that there is a small core of supporters.
Tomorrow Osservatorio will meet, on Tuesday Casms, which can count even with one part of Aise, it is a secret service that takes care of the problems on the stadiums.
"The Corps of the Leader-Leader and the tight arms during the Mameli hymn? in Bulgaria it is not a crime...".
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in a really little happy way), who has been the director of the Viminal Observatory for a few weeks (having the place that was before Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously a questor in Terst, where the core of the Ultras Italia supporters, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate leaders, but of course that the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a shame.
“I’m not a sociologist – adds Osservatorská jednička – crimes are attributed to the country in which they have happened.
So far this group has remained within the boundaries, now we will look at what has happened and evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about swinging at Mameli’s hymn: it’s not a crime either, but if you allow it, it’s non-education.”
