The members of the Welsh Assembly are worried that they look like muffins.
A section of the Assembly was astonished by the suggestion that their title be changed to 'MPs'.
This proposal was prompted by plans to change the name of the Assembly to the 'Parliament of Wales'.
Members of the whole political spectrum are worried that this could become a laughingstock.
One Labour member said his group was concerned that the new title was rhyming with "Tup and Wudlb".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, this definitely has an offensive connotation.
According to one Plaid member, the whole group is not happy and has suggested alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party stated that his group was not biased towards the name change, but noted that the new name of the PMU (in English  MWP) had a certain phonetic resemblance to Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced similarly to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting the bill to change the name, made the following statement: It is understood that the final decision on all descriptive names by which members of the Assembly are referred to will belong to the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Assembly for Wales the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found widespread support for the Assembly to be called the 'Parliament of Wales'.
As regards the status of its members, the Commission prefers members of the Parliament of Wales, abbreviated MPU, but the MPU option has received the most support following a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly are proposing alternatives, but reaching a consensus will clearly be a headache for Speaker Ellen Jones, who is expected to submit a draft of the bill for change within weeks.
The reform bill will also include other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules on disqualifying its members, as well as the design of the committee system itself.
The members of the House will have the final say on what they are called when they come to debate the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on whether to change their country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was planned to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has an administrative region called "Macedonia".
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to Greek state territory, and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on changing the name of the country, has said he will not consider the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the country's name is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are ringing in the midst of the difficulties of the churches in Haarlem.
"If we look at it from a historical point of view, the old people I spoke to said there was a bar and a church on every corner", Mr Adams said.
Today, both are missing.
Adams says the demise of the bars is understandable.
'People today socialize in different ways,' he adds.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhood pubs where everyone meets regularly".
As for the churches, he expressed concern that the money from the sale of assets would not last as long as the leaders expected, and sooner or later they would be in the same situation.
The man adds that churches can be replaced by apartment blocks where people live who do not help the other sanctuaries of the neighborhood survive.
The vast majority of people buying homes in these buildings will be white, which will accelerate the process of closing these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most of the new settlers will attend them.
Both churches were built by white pastoralists before Harlem became a black neighborhood of the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the years after 1930.
After that, the building became the property of the black residents of the neighborhood.
St. Martin's was taken over by black Christians led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who had organized a boycott of the retailers on 125th Street, which is the main shopping street in Harlem, because they didn't want to hire black employees.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by fire, but Father Johnson's parishioners drew up a plan to restore it, and they commissioned the bells.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly calls them the poor bells.
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: "Cultural treasure" and "irreplaceable historical tool".
The corresponding expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bell system in the world to be used by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who switched to the larger system at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriwether mentioned that St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has been playing out at St. Martin's over the past few weeks has been a complex tale woven by architects and contractors, some brought in by the secular leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The vestry, which is the governing body of the parish consisting of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concerns that the diocese would be inclined to pass on the costs of the vestry, even though it had no role in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy was mauled by a shark while hunting lobster in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the fishing season, representative authorities said.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hummel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about a half-hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and he went in with a whole group to pull him out of the water.
Hamill first thought the child had caught a lobster and was excited, then he realized he was shouting "Hit me!"
He bit me!
Hamel said that when he reached the boy, he realized that the entire area of his clavicle had been torn.
"I called everybody out of the water because there's a shark!" added Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
It's not yet known what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
Rescue captain Larry Giles told a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the water a few weeks earlier, but was deemed to be of no danger.
Giles adds that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of his body.
Authorities have closed access to the coastline from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Soumi in Encinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons while the investigation is ongoing.
Gilles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not dangerous to humans.
Sainsbury's planning to take over the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is taking on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by opening beauty stalls at its sites, where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of a major offensive in the UK beauty market, which is estimated at £2.8 billion and continues to grow while fashion and home sales are down, the biggest beauty stalls to date will be located in 11 stores across the country, with more stalls set to open if the initiative is successful.
The investment turn in the beauty industry comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelf space that has been recently taken up by televisions, microwaves and other household appliances.
Sainsbury's said they're doubling the number of beauty products on offer to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space, similar to the offerings in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also re-launching its boutique makeup line, so that most products can be used by vegans  something that is increasingly sought after by younger consumers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will be piloting discount programmes at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London last week, while the second will be opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a shifting focus on buying smaller quantities of food daily at convenient times means that supermarkets have to make more efforts to attract shoppers.
Mike Cope, Sainsbury's chief executive, has said the stores will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to compete with the likes of discounters Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos locations in hundreds of stores, and also opened up Habitats locations since they bought both chains two years ago, which the company says has boosted grocery sales and made acquisitions even more profitable.
The chain's previous attempts to re-design its premises for cosmetics and pharmaceuticals failed.
Sainsbury's had a joint venture with Boots at the turn of the century, but the partnership ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company's supermarket sites.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmaceutical business to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Sources say Lloyds will play a role in the plan by providing a rich assortment of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury's, made the following statement: "We have transformed the look and character of our stalls to improve the overall experience for our customers.
We also invested in special training for our colleagues who will offer professional advice on the spot.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every taste and every need in a captivating setting with a convenient location, and this combination makes us an attractive beauty destination that challenges the very concept of the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby's rejection of an £11 million deal.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal with his lifestyle company to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly appliances and accessories.
The couple's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning has announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones in the lurch after pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was furious when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts worth up to £1.5 million meant she would no longer have time for his Truly brand of home goods and accessories.
The business is akin to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, and is rumoured to have doubled Willoughby's fortune, estimated to be worth £11 million.
When 37-year-old Wilby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK by plane to head for one of her holiday properties.
One of the sources shared the following: "Truly was definitely Holly's top priority.
It was supposed to be a long-term commitment that would secure her future for the next few decades.
Her decision to leave has left absolutely everyone completely unprepared.
Nobody thought it could happen on a Tuesday so close to the start.
There's a warehouse at Marlow headquarters that's full of products waiting to be sold.
Experts believe that the departure of the 'This Morning' presenter, who is one of Britain's most successful stars, could cost the company millions due to the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home products, and could also lead to a delay in the launch of the brand.
And last but not least, it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three children, along with her husband Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby herself co-founded Truly with Kapp in 2016, with Jones, 52, joining as the company's chairman in March.
The two families often go on vacations together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will also replace Anne McParlin as the host of I'm a Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones made the following statement last night: "We will not be commenting on his business dealings".
Tough negotiations leading to a "fusion of relations"
He joked about the criticism he would face from news outlets for making a comment that someone would consider "unsuitable for the president" and as too positive for the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump made so many concessions?
Trump responded in his own witty journalistic way.
I haven't given up anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second summit after the first was held in Singapore in June and was hailed by Trump as a "big step towards North Korea's denuclearisation".
But negotiations to eliminate these weapons are stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea "does not see reciprocal treatment" from the United States for its first steps on the path of disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the US continues with sanctions, which are designed to maintain tension.
Trump presented a much more optimistic view of the situation in his speech.
"Our relationship with North Korea is wonderful", he said.
We were on our way to war with that country.
Millions of people would die.
Instead, we now enjoy a wonderful relationship.
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results - halting missile tests, releasing hostages and returning the bodies of American servicemen home.
He also defended his unorthodox approach to negotiating with Kim.
"It's extremely easy to act like the president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded area, we'd have about 200 people right there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island and kill hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told they were no longer needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was forced to flee their homes, no national disaster was declared, a requirement for the initiation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, the unambiguous statement is made that international assistance is not wanted, which makes things a bit challenging", Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to go to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign staff will be allowed to operate on the country's territory.
National disaster agency spokesman Mr. Sutopo said Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether to allow international agencies to contribute to the recovery effort.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for this type of natural disaster.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on the rest of the coast.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu may have contributed to the loss of life, despite a warning being issued.
Even under the best of conditions, transportation between the many Indonesian islands presents a challenge.
Natural disasters make this logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship recently stationed in Lombok to care for earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will be at least three days before it can reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's backward infrastructure the centerpiece of his election campaign, investing large amounts of money in roads and railways.
But insufficient funds constantly plague his office, until Jocko again heads the ballot box the following year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands forced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with clubs, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Daniel Sturridge has brought home a late draw for Liverpool against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing the Premier League to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge receives a pass from Jordan Shakiri, about 27-28 yards from Chelsea's goal, as his team trails 1-0.
He put the ball on his left foot, then he made a precise shot at the far corner of the door.
The ball goes over the penalty area and heads to the top right corner of the net.
She has transferred the captive Kepa Arisabalaga and is caught in the net.
"I tried to get a good position to control the ball because players like Shaq always look for passes in front, so I just tried to buy as much time as possible for a good shot at the goal", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kant wondering, I pushed my ball and just shot without thinking much.
Chelsea took the lead 1-0 in the 25th minute after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward passed with a heel to Mateo Kovacic, then sprinted from the middle of the pitch to the half of Liverpool.
Kovacic exchanged a quick double-centre pass.
Then he fired a quick pass that led Azar to a clean spot in the penalty box.
Azar overtook the defenders and scored with his left foot in the far corner past Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 15:00 this Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be Videtone in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency reported early Sunday.
Many people are trapped amidst the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit the country on Friday and caused waves up to 20 feet high, reported at the press conference the agency's spokesman Suto Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, is littered with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The remains of a 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds on Grayson Mewes on John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking for the cooperation of anyone in the area who saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan made the following statement: "The investigation is still at an early stage, but I would urge anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask that anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something with their dash cams, contact us as they may have information vital to the investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found on private property.
This afternoon, a group of friends, who believe the woman to be a friend, have arrived at the scene and are asking where she was found this morning.
The investigation is continuing, with police saying they are now informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives on Grayson Mews tried to get back to his apartment, but was informed by police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
The man was speechless when he heard what had happened.
Residents have been told it will be hours before they are allowed to return home.
One of the officers reported to a man that the entire area is being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman showed up at the scene.
She keeps saying, "This is so horrible".
At 2 p.m., two police vans crossed the curb, while another van remained outside.
There are officers in the cordon, watching the block.
Anyone with information is kindly requested to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, code 247 on September 30th.
Cromwell's Parliamentary statue becomes the latest memorial hit by "rewriting history"
Its banning would be poetic justice for his almost Taliban destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said the following: "It was inevitable in the current statue removal debate that Oliver Cromwell's near Westminster Palace became a target.
The iconic fighting of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor committed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be victimized by the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th-century opinion and a piece of historiography for a figure many still consider to be worthy of respect.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, to be the protector of Parliament against outside pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognizable figure representing one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated.
Pig-killer fatally wounds Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his surname as Yuan, was found dead with a ruptured artery and covered in blood near a flea market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig herder was preparing to inject vaccines into pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It is believed he arrived with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also threw the door to the next hut wide open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig in the barn with a bloody udder.
Forensic evidence confirms that the 550-pound pig fatally attacked the farmer, the report said.
"My cousin's feet were bloodied and disfigured", Cousin Wu claimed, quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal killer did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up so it couldn't attack anyone else while the police gather evidence from the crime scene.
It is also reported that the family of Yuan and the market management are negotiating compensation for the death.
Although they are rare, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man critically injured.
Ten years before that, a 650-pound pig had pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to chase him away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
They're just playing.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... they have no intention of hurting anyone.
But one must also treat them with respect, the man concludes.
The fading Hurricane Rosa will bring frequent and torrential rains to the southwestern United States.
The weather forecast says that Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cool waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will cause flooding rains in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa is currently projected to have winds of 85 miles per hour, which is a Category 1 hurricane as of 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that by Sunday Rosa will move north.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, a syncline is beginning to form, moving eastward towards the west coast of the United States, and as Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture deep north into the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Over the next few days, the tropical humidity along with the approaching sync will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At a local level, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to rainfall of 2 to 3 inches an hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, we're expecting two to four inches of rain, especially over most of Arizona.
Flash floods are possible in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to travel hand in hand in the desert when the threat of tropical rains is imminent.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging rivers, and thunderstorms will cause dust to rise and gusty winds.
The approaching syncline will bring heavy rainfall to some parts of the southern California coast.
It's possible to reach precipitation of over half an inch, which will result in sloped small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain of the rainy season.
On late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before rain spreads over a larger area on late Monday and into Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
October could bring big temperature swings in the U.S. As the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this results in dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday is a prime example of the dramatic temperature changes in the central United States.
There's a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to rise and spread.
Most of the central and eastern United States are expected to have a warm start to October, with temperatures in the mid-80s expected to prevail from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
Temperatures in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-range weather forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial.
More than 20 million people tuned in Thursday on six television networks to watch the gripping spectacle of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault that occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political opposition continued as the networks cut their regular return programs in the last minutes of Friday: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI should conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh had drunkenly groped her and tried to take her clothes off during a high school party.
Cavanaugh, in his emotionless testimony, is absolutely adamant that nothing like this ever happened.
It's probably even higher than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen to have watched the testimonial on Friday.
The company has counted the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no immediate data available on the other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen has traditionally had a hard time measuring the number of people watching from their workplaces.
For comparison, we're talking about an audience the size of a championship football game or the Hollywood awards.
Fox News Channel, whose anchors strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million.
Interest has remained high since the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office went out with a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, cameras on CNN and CBS caught him on Friday being whistled around by protesters as he tried to take an elevator to a Judiciary Committee meeting.
During the entire harassment for several minutes, he never raised his eyes from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here, standing in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's representing the truth to the state?
"You have power, while many women are completely helpless", the attacks continued.
Flake replied that his office had already made a statement, and before the elevator doors closed, he announced that he would make a further statement during the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks provided a full live coverage several hours later when the Judiciary Committee had to decide whether to move Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if he was sure the FBI would review the charges against the nominee next week, which opposition Democrats insisted on.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few senators, Flake made a decision.
His election was certainly crucial, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political meddling" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "politically playing" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published earlier with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, stepped up his attack on her so-called "cheque-game plan" for Brexit, suggesting that collecting customs duties from Britain to the EU and vice versa is "completely absurd".
Police arrested suspect Dithien Simpson in connection with the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Deetian Simpson, 20, has been arrested and booked into jail on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department has announced.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, with police reporting that Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and also found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After Simpson's interrogation, police announced that he had confessed to the fatal shooting of Wade.
His bail was set at $350,000, Advocate reported.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police's fugitive tracking unit, the police crime lab, Southern University police, and the local community for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Aleva thanks local law enforcement for "modern justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot, 6-inch player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Waynes, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "in shock" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
Wade said that "it's something that worries a man all the time".
A volcano scatters ashes over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepet volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash ejections were recorded in the last 24 hours.
The center has observed multiple tremors and tremors.
Photos posted on social networks show a thin layer of dust covering the windshields of cars in some of Mexico City's neighborhoods, such as Huequimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity at the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with the gendarmerie as thousands joined opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing secession vote.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmerie, began to throw eggs and paint dust at the peacekeepers, creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
Later in the day, there were more clashes with the police, with the officers resorting to their batons to control the situation.
For hours, pro-independence groups shouted "We do not forget, we do not forgive", while those who declared themselves for the preservation of the country's integrity retorted with "Spain forever".
Local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical attention for minor injuries.
Tensions remain high in the pro-independence region even a year after an October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist-minded Catalans.
The overwhelming majority voted for independence, although turnout was low as most of the opponents of secession boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the holding of the vote in the region's polling stations in a series of violent clashes.
Independence groups spent Friday night on the streets to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
Nevertheless, the demonstration took place, but she was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who joined the separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer harbors hope for Catalonia's chances of independence.
Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now it seems we are in a stalemate, the man added.
Despite a significant victory, albeit by a small margin, in last December's regional elections, pro-independence Catalan political parties have been struggling this year, with many of their most prominent leaders either in self-imposed exile or detained pending trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Juan Piug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, claims that the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
His comment was that he's getting more and more tense.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders arrested pending trial last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
He claims that 'my candidacy for the European elections is the best way to counter the regression of democratic values and the repression that we are witnessing from the Spanish government'.
Londoners: Men arrested after car crashes into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30pm British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Bloomings has announced that there is damage to both the gate and the building itself.
It's also possible that the car was shot with a crossbow.
A goal from Menga to give Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured the win.
Rookie outfielder Livingston surprised Rangers and took just the second loss to Steven Gerrard in his first 18 games as manager of the Aybrooks.
Dolly Menga's goal proved decisive, and Gary Holt's team was tied on points with second-placed Hibernia.
Gerrard's team remains unbeaten on home soil in the Premier League this season, and next Sunday they face the leader Hearts, who are eight points behind in the standings.
But before that, the Rangers host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is already on a six-game losing streak in the league, and manager Holt has yet to taste defeat since taking over from Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a good opportunity against the homeless.
Holt's team had to lead on the score long before he scored, and his direct style of play was extremely difficult for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made a pass, but it went out of bounds, and then Alan Lithgow fired a shot past the goal post after Craig Halkett returned the ball with his head to him.
The hosts let the Rangers play the ball, knowing that they could seriously inconvenience the guests from static.
And that's how the winning goal was scored.
The Rangers committed a foul, and Livingston played well, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson combining to take out Menga, who led the ball and scored from the middle of the penalty area.
Up to this point, the Rangers had more control of the ball, but they were facing the home team's impenetrable defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly rarely had to interfere.
This style of play continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a save.
The Rangers goalie saved Scott Pitman's kick with his foot, and a head kick by Littlow went past the door after another static for Livingston.
Livingston's penalty area was full of centers, but they were easily cleared, and the referee twice dismissed the visitors' claim for the shot, first after a duel between Halkett and the Glen Middleton reserve, and then on suspicion of foul play.
The phenomenal by Livingston
Alessdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great result for Livingston.
The team is playing just superbly, continuing to exceed expectations and improve their performance.
The style of play and the line-up have hardly undergone any changes since the team's return to the Premier League, but Holt deserves much praise for the way he has transformed the team since his appointment.
He's got real heroes on the field.
Captain Halkett was incredible, organizing the defense in a superb way, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell under constant pressure.
Meanwhile, the Rangers have shown nothing inspiring.
Under Gerard's leadership, they've demonstrated some great things, but in this case, they were way below the standard.
They missed the final pass before the goal, only once managed to split the home defense - this loss should wake up the Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the standings.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), we witnessed smiles and blue skies as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship is cooling due to issues affecting human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU acceptance.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside of Turkey.
Police had prevented the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but there were still many supporters who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also raised their voices, denouncing both the policy of Erdogan himself and the German government's decision to allow him into the country.
The various protests reflect the fracture caused by a visitor who is considered a hero by some German Turks and yet despised as a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: A cyclist rests after colliding with a car
A cyclist has died after being hit by a car in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy thoroughfare in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped and medical help arrived, but the cyclist died on the spot.
The crash comes months after another cyclist was killed after being hit by an escaped driver on Childers Street, which is less than a mile from the site of Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police have announced that their officers are working on identifying the man, and then they will notify his relatives.
The road is closed and bus routes are diverted, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Larten Prison: Six guards were injured in a riot
Six prison guards were injured in a riot at the high-security men's prison, the Bureau of Prisons reports.
The riot broke out at Long Larten Prison in Worcester at around 9:30am UK time on Sunday and is still ongoing.
To contain it, special officers from the "Tordano" squad will have to deal with eight inmates, as the riot itself is confined to one wing of the prison.
The wounded guards suffered minor facial injuries and were treated at the scene.
A spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons issued the following statement: "Special trained officers have been called to deal with the Long Larthing incident.
Six guards received medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons and we are very clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police, with possible extension of sentences.
Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to be treated in hospital after an attack on a prisoner.
Also, last October, riot police were called to the prison to quell a violent riot in which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flash flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although dry areas may benefit)
It's rare for Arizona to be hit by a tropical storm, but there's a good chance it will be early next week, as the fading Hurricane Rosa drifts across the desert to the southwest, bringing with it the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already established flash flood advisories for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Phoenix on Tuesday, with a chance of rain late on Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted on Twitter that since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have sustained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rome, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of precipitation possible in some places.
For those who are not threatened by flash floods, the rain caused by Rosa can actually be a blessing, as the region is heavily affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some of the rain is likely to be beneficial, as the southwest is currently dry.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Commission, just over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least one extreme drought, the second-most severe category, according to weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa is leading to the landfall of the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which still boasts a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, is 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is meeting with cooler waters over the Pacific Ocean and is therefore weakening.
It is therefore expected to make landfall in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rain over parts of Mexico could be heavy and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of e to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible", reports weather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before hitting the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move across Arizona into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The primary risk from Rosa or its aftermath is extremely heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States", warns the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening flash floods and carrying various waste streams into the deserts as well as landslides in the mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The wounded boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 0400 British time on Saturday morning.
He's been admitted to a hospital where his condition remains "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested in the Radstock area overnight, Avon and Somerset police say.
The police are asking anyone who may have seen the footage to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered from the meanness and anger of the Democratic Party.
"Every vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the insidious and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump announced at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump announced that Kavanaugh had "suffered the indignity and wrath of the Democratic Party during his nomination".
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, flatly rejecting Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexual assault from decades ago when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the arraignment.
The president made a statement on Saturday that the American people today witnessed the intelligence, courage and qualities of Kavanaugh.
"Every vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a great reputation for public service", the president told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president was indirectly referring to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican votes in the general election.
We have five weeks left until one of the most important elections of our time.
"Although I'm not a candidate, I'm actually running", Trump continued.
That's why I go around and I fight for the good candidates.
Trump said that the Democrats have made it their mission to obstruct and hinder.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican aide told CNN.
Hundreds die in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, casualties are rising
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were swept off the coast by giant waves when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when at dusk the coast was swept by waves up to six meters (18 feet) high, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami hit after a 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, which is why many people were victims of the disaster", said Suopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency BNPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The water had washed away cars, trees, entire houses, and hit everything in its path", Negroho continued, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
"Some people climbed trees and managed to escape from the water", he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, collapsed and twisted bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The secondary tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Bureau for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) has issued a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the city's geographic location, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugraho described the damage as "enormous" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, the spokesman added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could be higher along the coast 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Dongola that is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
He also added that the communications were completely cut off and there was no information from Donggala.
The Red Cross, for its part, said that more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers were already on their way to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it can only get worse".
On Saturday, the agency was fiercely criticized for not reporting the tsunami that hit Palu, although officials explained that the waves arrived at the time of the announcement.
Amateur videos shared on social media show a man on the top floor of a building shouting panic warnings to people on the street about an approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a huge wall of water slams into the shore, sweeping away cars and buildings.
Reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the video in time.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe power outage, which cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but evacuees are still in desperate need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for rescue efforts only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palle on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has now risen to over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision staff from Donggala made it safely to Palu, where they found shelter in the canvas shelters that were spread out in the courtyard of their office, they passed through a series of devastating scenes, Mr. Doceba said.
"They told me they saw countless houses destroyed".
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the rescue and recovery teams that have begun work, some complain that foreign rescuers with extensive experience in such situations are prevented from reaching Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, personnel and supplies from abroad can only be started if the affected area is declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"The disaster is still regional", said Auliya Ariani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government has declared a national emergency, we can accept international aid, but they haven't declared a state of emergency yet".
As the second night of the Friday earthquake and tsunami falls over Palau, the friends and families of those still unaccounted for continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones have somehow survived the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Championships, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped at the Roa-Roa Hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
"As an elder in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden", he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours after news of the Roa-Roa hotel collapse reached the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the competitors in Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue markings, however, the only response to his messages was a single gray one.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered", he added.
Thieves withdrew $26,750 during a charge at an ATM in Newport on the Levy.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling an ATM in Newport on Levy, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM at the amusement park and was preparing to load it with cash, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
While the man was busy, another man came running up behind Brink's employee and stole a purse full of money.
Witnesses reported seeing multiple suspects fleeing the scene, the report continues, but police have not given a number for the robbery.
Anyone with information on the identities of the suspects should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to "Ye".
Along with announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: "The man formally known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been using the moniker Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to debut his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who quit "for emotional reasons", the show's creator tells us.
As well as being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously claimed the word has religious meaning to him.
"I believe 'you' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you' or 'you'", West said earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boi.
In this way I am you, I am us, it is us.
He passed from Kanye, which means just one person, to Yeo, which is a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
The rapper is one of many in his field who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and aliases, including Puff Daddy, Pee Diddie, or Diddie, but this year he has announced his preference for the aliases Lion and Brother Lion.
One of West's former associates, Jay Z, also came up with a variant with or without dashes and/or capital letters in his nickname.
The president of Mexico has vowed not to use the military against civilians.
Newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
On Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza, President Lopez Obrador promised "never to use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the Plaza on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people, as left-wing student movements slowly spread across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and opening more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education are drawing young people into criminal gangs.
The US needs to double its funding for AI development
As China becomes increasingly active on the front lines of AI development, the US should double its research budget in this area, says AI researcher and developer Kai-Fu Loi, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various branches of the US government made statements on the topic of AI, even though the US as a whole has no official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: the country aims to become the number one AI innovation country by 2030.
'Doubling the budget for AI development would be a good start, given that all other countries are way ahead of the US and have yet to make further breakthroughs in AI,' said Lee.
Doubling the funding could also double the chances of the next big AI breakthrough coming from the US, as Lee informed CNBC in an interview last week.
Li, whose book "The Superpowers of AI: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's largest AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie University, Melon Lee worked on an AI system that beat the most successful ice hockey player in America, then became CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee credits the federal government's previous technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics competition, with asking when the next one will be, which will help identify the new visionaries.
'Researchers in the US often have to work hard to win government funding,' Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking away academic leaders, it's corporations", the man claims.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired university luminaries to work on AI.
Lee also argues that changes in immigration policy could help the US bolster its AI program.
"I think that AI science doctors should be automatically offered green cards", the man claimed.
The US State Department announced its plan to develop next-generation AI in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people from academic institutions in a similar way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Center on Artificial Intelligence, which aims to bring together industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, they're currently investing over 100 million dollars a year in AI development.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Congress, which had wanted to create a National Security Council on artificial intelligence, hadn't seen any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
Macedonians voted in a referendum this week to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is a region called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim against its territorial integrity, and has therefore vetoed its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Georgy Ivanov has said that he himself will not vote in the referendum, while a campaign to boycott it casts doubt on whether the referendum will reach the minimum 50 percent required for its validity.
The question on the ballot papers is: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, which include Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to achieve the accession of the post-Yugoslav state of Macedonia to organizations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to give my vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", shared Olivera Georgievska, a 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum is not binding, enough members of Parliament have said they will respect the result of the referendum to the extent that the vote is now decisive.
To change the name of the country, two-thirds of the members of parliament must vote.
The State Election Commission reported that there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters attended the polls.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Gjoce Tanevski, a citizen of the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavadarkov, at the age of 54, was preparing a small stage and arranging chairs in front of the tents, which were obstructed by the boycotting the referendum.
'We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with our heads held high, not through the servant's door,' Kavadarkov said.
Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership will bring about the necessary investments for Macedonia, as the unemployment rate in the country is over 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as over 80 percent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his own vote.
The head of state also stated that the positive result would lead to "the affirmation of the future of our people".
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies published the results of a poll that showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll, by Macedonian TV station Telma, revealed that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will represent the first serious blow to the policies of the pro-Western government since it won power last May.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City goes through all the Brighton defence and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame Brighton's defence and brought home a 2-0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Agüero's goal in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine goalkeeper was found with a pass in the middle of the field.
He out-run three Brighton defenders before sprinting the ball into empty space forward.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He slipped past one of the defenders, then left the rest of the field behind him at the Brighton penalty area.
Then he passes a left to Sterling.
The English striker with one touch returned the ball back to Aguero, who with a right-footed stroke overtook Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his neck.
"Aguero is struggling with some injuries to his legs", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We planned for him to play about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky that you scored a goal right at that moment.
But it was Sterling who secured the Sky Blues' first lead in this Premier League match.
He signed off in the 29th minute.
In the naked situation, Aguero got a pass deep in Brighton's half.
He immediately sent a pass to the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sanne advanced with the ball, then found Sterling with a pass on the far post.
The Skyrocketers' attacker got a close-up shot just before the ball went out.
City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group stage match at 12:55 on Tuesday afternoon at the Rhein Neckar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the game of the future of the Rockies.
With the Nationals not making the playoffs, there's no point in another game of the starting pitcher.
And yet, the always ambitious Scherzer is hoping to be the starter Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, if the game matters to the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West standings.
The Rockies have secured at least a wild card game after a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but it's still not certain they'll win their first division title.
Even though we're not fighting for anything ourselves, we want to end the season with a good game in Denver, where the crowd and the other team will give their all to win what may be the most important game of the year for them.
Why would I want to miss a game like that?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starting pitcher for Sunday, but it's speculated that they'll allow Scherzer to participate if the game is decisive.
For Scherzer, this would be his 34th game as a starting pitcher this year, as he'd have practice on Thursday and would have his normal rest time until Sunday.
The right-handed pitcher from Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is recruiting supporters in West Virginia.
The president was coyly referring to the situation with his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of Republican votes in the general election.
In November, everything we've accomplished will be put at risk.
Five weeks left until one of the most important choices of our lives.
"This is one of the greatest moments in recent history, and I also state that while I'm not a candidate, I'm actually a participant, which is why I'm fighting so hard for the right candidates", Trump said.
And then he went on to say, "You all see this horrible, horrible, radical group of Democrats, you see it with your own eyes.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary, you have witnessed their ruthlessness, their malice.
They don't care when they can get hurt, who they have to overcome to get their grip on power and control, because they're only interested in power and control, but we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, according to the president, have set their goal to "obstruct and hinder".
"What we've all seen in the last four days", he went on, calling the Democrats "angry, nasty, mean and unfaithful".
The president reminded the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, which prompted a loud cheer from the crowd.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you distribute the document?
Please what?
No, no, I was waiting. That was a really bad gesture. Probably the worst gesture I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a broad-minded party.
The Party does not tolerate those who speak out.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I'm just the latest Labour MP to be told he's not welcome just for speaking out.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way for standing up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors criticized me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironically similar to those Jeremy disagreed with under previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as the local Labour MP, Friday's meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today, the tone of most meetings and the promises of a "lighter and more moderate" policy have long been forgotten, if they ever were on the agenda at all.
It was becoming increasingly clear that different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion was judged on the basis of how much it pleased the party leadership.
It started soon after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues I used to work for who I thought shared similar political views began to expect me to turn around and take positions I would never agree with, whether it was on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I make a public statement - no matter what I actually say - there's a whole insulting barrage on social media, where there's a call to recant, a rejection of moderate politics, a statement that I don't belong to Labour.
This kind of thing doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know I've even had more luck than some of my colleagues, since the comments about me are at least predominantly political in nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and the determination of these colleagues who face sexist or racist slurs every day without being afraid of them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how such insults have become the norm.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said Labour should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer broad-minded, and any sign of mistrust or change in the voting rules becomes narrower.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years to be quiet, not talk so much, and then everything will be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the Thatcher government, which by its neglect led to the literal collapse of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a councillor at the local level or as a minister.
I've never hidden my political views, including during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my political stance and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who voted for the motion on Friday, I would like to say that as the country moves towards Brexit, it will hurt households, businesses and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the Labour leader.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not, that it is my pride to serve you and I promise that no threat of recall or political ostracism will prevent me from acting in the way that I see as best in your best interests.

The undefeated Air are leading the pack.
The two late goals may have slightly changed the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting match of the Tennent Premier League.
The team is now leading the standings and the only one of the top 10 teams to go undefeated.
Better defense and better utilization of opportunities proved decisive in a game that Coach Peter Murchie and his team can be very pleased with.
"I'm happy because the other teams have tested us pretty hard in the past matches, and we're still unbeaten", Murchy said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Congratulations on Air, they really took advantage of their situation better than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, followed by a successful extra from Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead of the score, but a yellow card for Scotland international Rory Hughes, released to play in the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take the lead in the match after Jason Bagot made an extra, followed by an unsuccessful extra.
Climo extended Air's lead from a penalty just before halftime, scoring an essay after the solo, and then making the extra shot, making the score 17-5 for Air at halftime.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, followed by Bagot's successful extra-time, reduced the lead to just five points.
A long stoppage followed due to a serious injury to Ruid Nott, who was carried off on a stretcher, and after the resumption of the match Air increased their lead after an ace by Stafford McDowall and a successful extra-shot by Climo.
After that, Air's acting captain Blair McPherson received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of their numerical advantage, putting heavy pressure on and making an ace through Bruce Colvin, followed by an unsuccessful extra shot.
However, the hosts returned to the spirit of the game, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card after knocking down Klimo with no ball, McPherson's penalty kick was used to help the forward line of the Air.
Climo made the extra shot, and not long after did it again, after Kyle Rowe caught the ball kicked by David Armstrong and brought the wing Gregor Henry on the flank for the fifth set of the hosts.
The star of Still Game seems to be headed for a new career in the restaurant business.
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems to have moved on to a more direct and warm industry after it was revealed he had been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he also writes and co-stars with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the show's last, as it seems Kearnan is already planning his life after Craigslist.
According to official records, he's a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor has refrained from commenting, although a source in the Scottish Sun has hinted that Kiernan is planning to get involved in the "thriving restaurant business" in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia's landlocked country hopes the vessel will open the way to the Pacific again
The Marines are constantly patrolling the rigged outpost at La Paz.
The ocean blue flag is waved over public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
It's our duty to get him back.
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost outlet handed to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century is still alive  as is the call to sail the Pacific again.
In fact, that hope is now stronger than it has been in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the international court on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"The strength is in Bolivia, there is a feeling of cheerfulness and unity everywhere, and the country expects a positive result", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzada.
Many Bolivians will be watching the International Court of Justice ruling on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will uphold Bolivia's claim and that after decades of negotiations, Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is set to face a contentious reelection battle next year, also staked heavily on the court's judgement on Monday.
"We are very close to regaining access to the Pacific Ocean", promised Morales last August.
But some analysts believe that the likelihood of the court's ruling in favor of Bolivia is very low, and even if it did, it would not change the reality of the situation.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to take Chilean territory and has decided not to determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the international court's ruling is only six months after hearing the last arguments indicates that the case is 'not complicated', replies Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of helping the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may actually have hurt it.
"The problem of access to the ocean has been exacerbated by the current government of Bolivia", Zarate said.
Then he suggested that Morales' belligerent rhetoric had erased what little goodwill Chile had left.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult to have a normal dialogue after what happened.
The two countries have not maintained diplomatic missions to each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, dismissed the idea that the court's decision was being made unusually quickly.
He said that on Monday, Bolivia will have "an incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile, and a chance to end 139 years of disagreement by achieving mutual benefits".
Calzada also rejected the idea that Morales - who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - has used the issue of access to the ocean as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"Reflection is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome our past problems".
North Korea says it won't proceed with nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never go for nuclear disarmament first if it is unable to trust Washington.
Ri delivered his speech Saturday to the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to honour the promises it made during the meeting of the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of re-launching deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after his Singapore meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri called "empty hope" the idea that continued sanctions and U.S. objections to a declaration to end the Korean War would bring the North to its knees.
Washington is not willing to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first making a significant gesture towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump are calling for a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal that they see as the only way to ensure their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to set up the preparations for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion shows reveal the latest in the massive hats that will soon be in the fashion stores near you.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or block out the sun's rays altogether, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown have revealed a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection that have taken the catwalk at Paris Fashion Week.
Pretty impractical hats caused a ripple on Instagram this summer as designers sent their eye-catching creations to the fashion community to stun.
Valentino's signature proposal was an extravagant beige hat with a feather-like wide rim that literally devoured the models' heads.
Other overly-large accessories included jewelled hoods, a witch's hat and even a pineapple - but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also unveiled a selection of strange masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had lipsticks and were not so much high fashion as Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs looked like a scuba gear complete with snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you're into this kind of fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion experts predict that the giant hats will soon be sold in the fashion stores near you.
The giant hats come on shortly after the "La Bomba" the two-foot-wide peripheral straw hat that has been seen on everyone's heads from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult of the highly impractical hat that has taken over social media has led to the emergence of another huge design on the fashion catwalk: a straw beach bag, almost as big as the wearer wearing a swimsuit model.
The orange-burnt raffia bag, with raffia lashes and a white leather handle, was the all-seeing item in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer". "After a designer makes such a big impression, it's going to be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, which continues in 2018 with another outstanding performance in examination results, only reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, the arts, music and other social sciences.
With up to 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best possible level to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education, their career choices and their place in a global world.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalised curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said this: "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, what you say will reach them.
But if you speak to him in his own language, you touch his heart.
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust with the people of other countries.
And from this year's test results, we see that languages are at the top of the list with the highest achievement for independent schools.
A total of 68% of pupils who had studied a foreign language achieved a high grade of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of pupils achieved A in Chinese, 72% in German, 69% in French and 63% in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland see foreign languages as a vital skill that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
At present, languages as a subject of free choice by pupils receive the same treatment as natural-mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in and outside the curricula of independent schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills showed that 17% of employers cited insufficient language skills as a reason for finding employees.
Therefore, increasingly, foreign language skills are becoming mandatory to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require the knowledge of a foreign language, making these skills essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career path chosen, if one masters a foreign language, one will have a real advantage in the future, having mastered such a skill, which remains for a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the multilingual person one step ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to conduct a language test, with French being the only language to reach double-digit proficiency at 15%.
And that's why investing in language learning today is important for kids now.
Speaking several languages, especially in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding good jobs.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the languages taught.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be more important for the UK in the future to 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are experts in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed in life, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role in the future of any country, which requires that this be taken into account in the education system.
And indeed, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellence, to young people in Scotland.
I must do it well.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Association.
Lebron will make his Lakers debut this Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who are eager to see LeBron James' first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will be playing in the team's first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not yet clear how many minutes he'll play in the duel.
"He'll be on the court between one and 48 minutes", joked Walton via the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James will likely play relatively few minutes in the game.
After a practice earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six preseason games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare for the new season", he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned Trump rallies, which include stops at familiar locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By postponing the confirmation vote on his choice to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is aiming to support the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress in the November ballot.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's visit to Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 p.m., Eastern time, this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to Wheeling, West Virginia, below by streaming live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to look at this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have been strained by allegations of sexual misconduct that have held up a Senate confirmation vote for a week while an FBI investigation is underway.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans gain momentum for the November election.
So the campaign for President Donald Trump has announced that these five rallies next week are all about activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so essential to his agenda that the president will visit as many states as possible and we are entering a campaign season filled with commitments", a spokesman for the Trump campaign told Reuters, declining to be identified.
Tonight's rally, scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw media attention from Pittsburgh, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, a Republican who is falling behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has come to give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Heather, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
The U.S. team will fight to the last, keeping their hopes alive before Sunday's singles.
After three consecutive sessions of no-huddle four-sides, Sunday afternoon matches may have brought what Ryder Cup needed.
The shifting of the advantage in sport is a very subjective concept, but one that the players believe in unreservedly, especially in a race like this.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
"They were six points ahead and now they're only four, so I guess we've got a little bit of momentum", Jordan Speight said at the end of today's race day.
Of course, Europe has a four-point lead with only 12 points to go.
But as Speight says, the Americans have a lot to show for themselves, and their fans should not lose hope, if we are to judge by the sportsmanship of Speight and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them took three out of four possible points.
Speight is in great shape from start to finish on every hole and is the true leader of his team.
The cheers of the fans grew louder as he advanced into the round, where a precise shot he made evened the score in the fourth, after he and Thomas were two strokes back after the first two holes.
His shot, which won the match on the 15th hole, was met with a strong ovation that makes us believe that all is not lost for the American team.
"The important thing is to think about nothing else and focus on your own game", says Speight.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to remember.
The only players to score more points than Speed and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup heroes so far.
The strange but delightful couple from Europe have won four out of four and seem to be getting by.
The Moliouds were the only couple who didn't have Sunday afternoon worship, but they also didn't have Saturday morning worship, or Friday afternoon or morning worship.
These successive successes, and the way the energy seemed to flow between them and the enthusiastic fans, solidified the view that they were the players who would win on Sunday and there would be no better pair than Fleetwood and Molinari, who would bring the potential win to Europe as the sun sets on Le National Golf.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
But the tales of European glory proved to be a little premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly took on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's football matches, as he teamed up with Alex Noren.
"Bogie" and two "Gold"s on the first nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swede in a situation they couldn't handle.
But in Sunday's games, there's no way anyone else can solve your problems.
Football and soccer matches are extremely interesting to watch up close because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they exchange, and the way that a strategy can change at any moment.
The Europeans played better as a team and therefore gained a considerable lead before the final day, but this session of four-legged matches showed that the American team was also ready to fight to the last, something that many people, especially in the United States, had strong doubts about.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a solid lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup, having led the USA by 10-6 after playing both the football and the football matches on Saturday.
The inspiring duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari started off with two wins against the unconvincing Tiger Woods, taking their Le Golf National assets up four points.
In an attempt to recapture the trophy they had lost at Hazeline two years earlier, Thomas Bjorn's European team dominated the morning's fourball matches over the Americans, who made mistake after mistake, and eventually Europe won the series with a 3-1 victory.
The U.S. was more resistant in the foursome matches, where they won two victories, but failed to close the gap.
Jim Furik's team needs eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first rookie from Europe to win four in a row, and he and the "Mollywood" Molinari, after this sensational weekend, became only the second pair to win four of their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After unsealing the lead against Woods and Patrick Reid in the Super Bowl, they were highly motivated to defeat the broken Woods and American rookie Bryson DeCambu with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who barely made it through his two matches on Saturday, has only occasionally shown flashes of brilliance, but so far has lost 19 of 29 matches in the Super Bowl and the Super Bowl, as well as a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who has been given a break for this morning's football matches, has partnered with Henrik Stenson in the two-and-one victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world number one and number three respectively.
But the team of Europe failed to enjoy a perfectly pleasant, cool, clear day southwest of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Speight and Justin Thomas have restored hope to the American people by scoring two points on Saturday.
They achieved a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Spaniards John Ram and Ian Poulter in the four-ball matches, and later came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the four-ball meetings, although they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team been four points behind in the singles, and according to the rules, Furyk's team will retain the trophy even in a tie.
But since they've been overtaken on two consecutive days, it seems their chances of a reversal on Sunday are not very good.
North Korea says there's no way to disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the continued sanctions deepened mistrust of the United States and there was no way the country could give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
At the annual general assembly of the world body, Ri Yong-ho said that "significant goodwill measures" have been taken in the past year, such as a halt to nuclear and missile tests, the destruction of the nuclear test site, and pledges to not proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"We are not seeing a response from the US, however", he said.
Without trust in the United States, we will not have faith in our own national security and there is no way under any circumstances that we will be the first to disarm unilaterally.
While Ri expressed North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking step-by-step steps, his statement seemed significant as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and Trump gave assurances on North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US is insisting that we first eliminate nuclear weapons" and increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and even objecting to the "declaration of ending the war", Ri said.
The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a meaningless dream of those who do not know us.
The problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust".
Ri did not mention whether a second meeting between Kim and Trump was planned, which the US leader highlighted through the UN earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister focused on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the nuclear disarmament side was South Korea, not the US, the Korean Peninsula's nuclear disarmament would not have come to such a standstill.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from the previous year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the targeting of North Korean missiles on the US mainland was inevitable, after the late President Trump called Kim "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
At the UN this year, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with "total destruction", praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearises.
On Wednesday, Trump stressed that there is no deadline for this, saying, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia are arguing that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must necessarily continue until complete, final and verified nuclear disarmament is achieved".
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying he had made progress, but only hours later North Korea accused him of making "gangster demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to destroy a missile site and a nuclear complex if the U.S. took "appropriate action".
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted to achieve normalization with Washington.
Harvard students on a course on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is making all students sleep more in an attempt to combat the growing culture of all-night caffeinated learning.
A professor has found that students at the world's number one university often do not even consider the very basics of how to care for themselves.
Charles Keisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed what he believes is the first course of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after speaking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
And then this girl came up to me and said, "Why are they telling me this now, in my senior year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being offered for the first time this year, is teaching students the most important things about how good sleep habits help with academic and athletic performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there's a picture of a dorm room where students are clicking on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of bedtime routines.
Another part of the study tells participants how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that this won't immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of your choice to smoke", added Prof. Keisler.
The culture of pride in studying all night still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Getting enough and quality sleep should be the students' "secret weapon" in fighting stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he says, even to avoid obesity, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into a starvation mode that makes them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Keisler design the course by taking one of his classes during his first year at Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread it around the campus.
It is hoped that the next step is to require all graduate students to complete a similar degree programme before joining a competing institution.
Professor Kessler recommends that students consider setting a bedtime and wake-up alarm and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause trouble falling asleep.
Menga's goal defeated Gerrard's team.
The Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's shot broke Steven Gerrard's scoreless run and brought a 1-0 win to Livingston.
Ibrox were looking to record their first away win since their 4-1 triumph in February over St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side suffered only Gerard's second defeat in his 18 games as manager, leaving his side eight points short of the detached Hearts, the Ladbrokes Premier League leaders.
Menga scored seven minutes into the break, and the Rangers' lack of constructive thinking never seemed to come close to equalising.
After the match, Rangers have dropped to sixth place, and Livingston is now third, trailing second-placed Hibernian by only a goal.
The Rangers may have additional problems, as the sideline referee, Callum Spence, has suffered a head injury after being hit by an object that was apparently thrown by the visitors' fans.
Gerard made eight changes in the team that beat Ayr in the Scottish League Cup semi-final.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same Livingston XI that took a point off of Hearts last week, and he should be pleased with the way his aggressive team has parried all the opponent's actions.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball possession, but the Livingstons did better on the more rare occasions when they did.
They should have scored in the second minute when Menga put Scott Pittman out with a touchdown against goalkeeper Alan McGregor, but the midfielder missed a good opportunity.
Later, Keegan Jacobs' foul-footing found captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow deflected the ball away from the back fence.
The Rangers took control of the game, but failed to create anything of substance in the final third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought there should be a penalty in the 15th minute when he collided with Steven Lawless, but the referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only had two hits in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily got away with a head shot from Lasana Kulibaly and a weak shot from Oviya Ejarea.
Although Livi's 34th-minute goal was surprising given his possession of the ball, it was entirely deserved.
The Rangers again failed to take Jacobs' deep center.
Scott Arfield was unresponsive when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who passed it in cold blood to Minga, who was easy to realize.
Gerard responded to the break by swapping Culibali for Ryan Kent and this swap almost immediately led to a result when the wing passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the shot.
Livingston, however, continued to force the visitors to play in a comfortable home-court style of play, with Lithgow and Halkett continually returning long balls sent forward.
Holt's team could have extended their lead in the final minutes, but McGregor managed to get past Jacobs' shot, and at the next corner, Lithgow shot headfirst through the beam.
The backup, Glen Middleton of the Rangers, called for a late-round punch after a duel with Jacobs, but once again, Thompson saw nothing wrong with the situation.
Yearbook: The inventor of the Geiger counter
A page from our Sunday Morning yearbook: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and a day... the day the future physicist Johann Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
A cornerstone of science ever since, the Geiger counter became a cornerstone of pop culture when in 1950 the movie "The Bells of Coronado" was released, starring the seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
What, for God's sake, is this?
It's a geiger counter and it's used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms being released by the radioactivity in the minerals.
It's definitely raining right now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine could train the immune system to recognize foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to recognize foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and modifying them in a laboratory
They can then look for a protein that is common to many types of cancer and inject it back into the patient
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells saw her ovarian cancer go away for more than 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and modifying them in a laboratory so that they can make a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then injecting them back into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 stimulates the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and 'training' them to target cancer cells has been used in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat that said "Let's Make America Great Again" on his SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after he gave a meaningless performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night, Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat that said "Let's Make America Great Again", he spoke out against the Democrats and declared his support for Trump.
I often talk to white people and they ask me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago, he said.
SNL began the show with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault complaints made by Christine Blaise Ford.
Although it was not aired, footage of West's performance was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear why Rock would try to mock West with his publication.
West also complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
I was being held backstage.
They said, "Don't go out in that hat".
They tortured me!
And then they claim I'm on a sinking ship, he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West goes on to say, "Do you want to see the sinking ship?" saying he's going to put on a Superman costume because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love.
The comments prompted at least two rounds of boos from the audience, and SNL crew members appeared embarrassed, Variety reported, with one saying, "The whole studio went silent".
West was invited at the last minute to fill in for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many by performing "I Love It" dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was backed by the head of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR TRYING TO HELP THE HUMBLE".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just beating himself up and that was great.
But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free to go.
"We are like that", she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, now known officially as Kenny West.
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pee Didi.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lion, and music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol.
Charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man in a restaurant in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed to death in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened at Ballyhackamore, police say.
The defendant is expected to appear in Magistrates' Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor's office.
The Game of Thrones star, Kit Harington, is against toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is best known for his role as the sword-wielding John Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, who is 31, has come out against the macho stereotype, saying that showing such roles on screen often leads young people to think they have to be "tough" to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed something was wrong and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, also 31, admits that he feels "too convinced" that this problem needs to be solved.
"At this point, I'm personally firmly convinced, what did we do wrong in terms of manhood?" he said.
What are we teaching the young men about the problem we see now?
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is it that is taught on television and in the streets that makes boys feel they have to become this particular type of man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change it?
Because clearly something is wrong with young men.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be participating in a prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the series ended the following summer, claiming that he was "finished with the battlefields and the horses".
Starting in November, Keith will be starring in a remake of Sam Shepard's "True West", a story about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor said that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened to him on Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on that show, so that's how he gave me my future family and defined my life going forward", he said.
Rose plays Ygrith, the girl that Kit Jon Snow's character falls in love with, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The two were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14 percent jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and spina bifida.
According to the National Health Service, more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, around 40 000 new cases were reported.
The majority of new cases are caused by sexual contact, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in LGBT communities is widespread.
Studies have shown that because of conservative values, 70 to 90% of men who have had sex with men end up marrying women.
Many cases of disease transmission are due to improper protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government pledged to provide universal access to HIV medication as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that there was a data leak of senators from the Republican Party, denouncing "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters condemned allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three Republican state senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were made by experts and ultra-right-wing websites.
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of state senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person from the Capitol during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak was made after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office, and they posted information about a member of her team, according to Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
 A member of my team  whose identity, personal information and safety were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims  is in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and is an absolute lie.
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
"There is a core to this denial", wrote Fleisher.
It suggests she doesn't have the temperament appropriate for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
He shouldn't be acting defiantly.
I must not question the prosecutor's motives.
He needs to be calm and balanced.
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of also appearing angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate for Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Essentially, if it's true", he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had referred the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent allegations.
"I will make sure that the perpetrators are found", she continued, "and that they are held legally accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team".
Review of Johnny English blows up again, a weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson.
It's now traditional to look for references to Brexit in any new British film, and it seems that this is also true of the revival of the action-comedy spy franchise for Johnny English  that launched in 2003 with Johnny English  and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will self-deprecation and mimicry that tells us how obviously stupid we are become a new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the glassy eyes and the "humble face" is allowed to re-enact things a second time - his name is of the utmost importance when it comes to a big comic creation for non-English-speaking cinema fans.
He is, of course, a silly secret agent who, despite his strange pretensions to flattering glamour, possesses a little of Clouseau, a little of Mr Bean, and a great deal of the man who contributed a note to the musical theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
It was also originally based on the chaotic traveller and international man that Atkinson played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
There's a good moment or two in the last Johnny English movie.
I loved it when Johnny English approached the helicopter, wearing medieval armor, and for a moment, the fins were clicking in his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy is obvious, but the humor is rather weak and oddly superfluous, especially when "serious" film franchises like "007" and "Mission Impossible" include a dose of comedy.
The humor seems to be aimed more at children than adults, and Johnny English's wacky misadventures are not, in my opinion, innovative or focused, as Acton's lack of play is reminiscent of Mr. Bean.
The ever-present premise is that Britain is facing serious problems.
A cyber-hacker hacked into the British super-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all operatives to the horror of the agent on duty - unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and pompous figure and is already suffering from a complete breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best for this quasi-Theresa May role, but there's nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisors informed her that she should call a retired agent, since all active agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who currently works as a teacher at a chic center, but who also illegally teaches lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here are some good shots of English recreating a spy rock academy.
English is called to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and is reunited with his former longtime sidekick Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a family man, married to a submarine commander, a fun role that's a little bit of a waste of Vicky Pepperdine's talent.
And so, Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the great problems of Her Majesty's secret services and face the fatal beauty Ofelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacy.
English and Bo begin their odyssey of farce: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos when they sneak onto Volta's luxury yacht; and English causes anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality headset to get to know the interior of Volta's house.
All the laughs are definitely from the previous movie, but because they're so cute and wild, there's a lot more content here for kids.
It's a pretty mediocre piece of work.
As with the other Johnny English films, I keep thinking, can't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies that they are developing a plan to get the British to work four days a week, but get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan to have the British work four weeks and get paid for five.
The party claims that it wants company bosses to pass on the savings made by revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them another day off.
She wants the workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but get the same pay.
Sources say the idea would "support the economic program and the party's plans to shake up the country in favor of workers".
The move to a four-day work week was endorsed by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A review of the policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won't happen immediately, but the four-day work week is a drive that fits into the approach of rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to have such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during their 2017 general election campaign.
But at the moment, this is not something that the whole of the Labour Party is in favour of.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not in the party's policy nor is it being considered".
Shadow chancellor John Macdonell used last week's Labour conference to unveil his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from the "impersonal directors" and "speculators" in the utility companies.
The Chancellor's shadow plans also mean that current shareholders in the water companies may not get their full share, as the Labour government could impose cuts on the basis of the violations found.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and to set up privatisation funds to transfer 10 percent of the net capital to private companies of employees, who can accumulate annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy speak to 60 Minutes about whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the bureau's findings could cause some of the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more forthright than his South Carolina counterpart.
I mean, of course, Kennedy said.
When I went to the hearing, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, after this allegation came out, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, decisive and unambiguous.
Graham's voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion about Brett Kavanaugh, and to change it, it takes a shaky indictment", he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has denied it outright, Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And no one she mentioned but could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it help reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday, New York City will be hosting the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive cast of performers and an equally impressive mission: to end poverty around the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring tens of thousands of people to the Great Central Park Meadow to not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to learn about the event's true goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), attendees had to complete a series of tasks or 'actions' such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or otherwise connecting to help raise awareness of their poverty eradication goal.
But how successful is Global Citizen 12 years before it reaches its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a brilliant way to get them to demand action or is it just another case of what's called "cliquism" -- people thinking they're doing something meaningful when they sign an online petition or tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million actions by its supporters, advocating for a multitude of different causes.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and communications arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds have already directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the 'Power of Nutrition' UK-based investor-developer partnership, the 'Helping Children to Reach Their Full Potential' commitment, which promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4700 tweets from 'global citizens'.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition just a historical note", Power of Food Ambassador Tracy Ulman told an audience at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government has announced funding for a project, 'The Power of Nutrition', which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the WFP's on its website, asking "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: It will be a long and difficult journey. We will fail sometimes and we will fail again.
But just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just a few of the performers at this year's New York event, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use naval forces to block and hinder energy exports  Interior Minister
Washington can, if necessary, use its navy to prevent Russian energy products from entering markets including the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zink has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zink argues that Russia's involvement in Syria  specifically, where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government  is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just like they did in Eastern and Southern Europe", he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can, through our Navy, ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block them to make sure that energy products don't reach the market", he said.
Zink addressed attendees at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that bills itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He aimed to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were the same.
"The economic option for Iraq and Russia is, more or less, to stimulate and replace the fuel", he said, while also calling Russia "the number one Japanese" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with boosting LNG exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says makes Berlin a "hostage".
Moscow has stressed several times that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's vehement opposition to the project is driven by purely economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organization, the Federation of German Industry (DBDI), has called on the US not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she'd "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to come into Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I'm going to seriously consider running for president.
Warren expressed his judgment about President Donald Trump during the city council, saying that he's leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm squeezing myself to the bottom of my soul like Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we can vote".
But a poll taken on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters don't think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported this nomination.
The poll showed more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Other senior Democratic Party figures discussed in terms of potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin pointed out PTSD to Track Palin at a rally for Donald Trump
Truck Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident Monday night.
"What my own son is going through after he's returned is familiar to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers come home with", she told an audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that they come back a little changed, hardened, they come back and wonder if they'll get the respect that they and their brothers in arms gave to the country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman included in a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have backed a court challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the District filed a plea of good faith in Washington in support of asylum seekers and challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August, has not been released.
She claims her partner and the sons of the violent gang members abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She's being held in Texas.
The state attorneys who help Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have a large number of asylum seekers coming to the U.S., as nations facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 Immigration Appeals Board decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be dealt with according to the specific facts and circumstances and such a ban violates this principle", the goodwill report says.
In addition, the lawyers argue in the report that the policy of denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labor".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
"Asylum is granted to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political belief", Sessions said in his July 11 policy message.
The shelter was never meant to alleviate all the problems - not even all the serious ones - that people face every day, all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as deaths doubled during the search for survivors
The situation for the survivors is becoming more and more difficult.
"I feel very tense", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her sick son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes to try to salvage some of their flooded belongings.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake are overcrowded.
Some of the victims, including Dwee Harris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, were taken outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients are being treated outdoors for ongoing aftershocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he recalls the terrible earthquake in the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
"I think I was pushed into the wall", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he had come to town with his family to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then she went silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
One week after an official newspaper in China ran a four-page ad in an American daily about the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump cited the paid publication of China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere with the U.S. congressional elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it's common for foreign governments to run commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war, in which they're equalizing tariffs on imports between countries.
According to experts from the US and China, at the beginning of the trade war, China's tariffs were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in a comment in the weekly Des Moines Register, "is now doubling down on this harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's venerable tradition of freedom of speech and the press by running paid ads in the Des Moines Register", Branstad writes.
"In contrast, at a newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited speech and you will not see a true reflection of the differing opinions that the Chinese people may have regarding China's troubling economic trajectory, given that the media is under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party", he writes.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish his article, though he did not specify which one.
With the Cavanaugh coup, Republicans are pushing back against women voters in the midterm elections, analysts warn.
As many of the top Republicans stand behind and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on multiple sexual assault charges, analysts have warned there will be a backlash, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around the table are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already indicated they want to continue with the vote.
These things can't be undone", Grant Raher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Raehr said he doubts whether Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation will be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November", said Carine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, on Friday, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be turned off", said Stu Rottenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, in a news release.
People say the problem is already serious; it is true.
But it could become even more serious, especially among suburban female voters and younger voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don't vote because they don't like the president.
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed for confirmation of the nomination.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh gets the seat, it's about how Republicans deal with it and how they deal with it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
Americans, however, seem to be somewhat divided on who to believe in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, leaning slightly more towards the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably trust Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say they definitely or probably trust Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same of Ford.
At Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's claims, as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her while she was drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while they were at a party during her time at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, is starting a venture that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds the open-source platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We must do it now", he said of the undertaking.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own 'online repository of personal data' or POD.
It contains lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are accessible through any browser, and at the same time it's all of them at once.
The unique thing about online personal data storage is that the user determines who has access to what information.
The company calls it "personal data empowerment".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is that the company invests resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought from IBM, several developers contracted to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change when all their business models are completely updated overnight.
We don't ask for their permission.
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide energy for commerce and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful influence in the net neutrality debate.
Although he started Inrupt, Berners-Lee would remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the Internet", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: in memory of the Victorian Cross-winning chaplain of the First World War
It marks 100 years in the hometown of the only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross for his part in action during the First World War.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, unaware that he had been awarded Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandsons, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's work was awarded the medal.
According to the London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in very thick fog and under heavy artillery and machine gun fire".
Later he attacked the line of fire and with "incredible courage" led the line forward before he attacked an artillery cannon with one hand and killed three of the squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never do, but it makes me humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Wang placed a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Wang said he was "honored to be part of the parade" and added "the virtue of a true hero is demonstrated through the support that will be provided to many people".
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine waiting all night to watch a full edition of Bellator 206 and finally not being able to witness the main event.
The San Jose broadcast featured 13 fights, including six from the main card, and was to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock, just as Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face off against each other, the UK audience was stunned when the broadcast was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after staying up late, especially because of the duel.
Fan described the tweeting of the children's cartoon as "some sick joke".
"The government decided that at 6pm this content was not appropriate, so the programme was replaced with a children's programme", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, in response to a question about the broadcast.
Peppa pig, yeah.
Bellator president Scott Cocker said they're working on scheduling the meetings to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when it comes to repetition, we can solve the problem", said Cocker.
But it's six o'clock on a Sunday morning, and there's no way we can schedule things so that the event is held here on a Sunday and there on a Monday.
We're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we received a lot of messages, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a government one.
I can promise you that next time it won't happen.
We're going to stick to five fights instead of the usual six, and we tried to give the fans more, but we overdid it.
This is an unpleasant situation.
Tom Daley felt "lower" because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete says it wasn't until he started high school that he realized that "not everyone is like me".
In an interview for the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he spoke about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he became less interested in winning the Olympics.
The longtime host of the show, Kirstie Young, is on sick leave for a few months.
When he first appeared on Laverne Daly's show, he said he felt "less than everyone else" growing up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said, "To this day, the feeling of inferiority and being different from others are actually the things that give me energy and strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "something", he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when he eventually learned of his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he did it because he was happy to live in the open, without consequences, and he wanted to inspire hope in others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, it was a surprise.
Daly married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he claims the age difference was never an issue.
"When you've gone through so much while you're so young", he said, "he was in his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later", he said, "it's hard to find anyone your age who's had such ups and downs".
The two became parents in June and have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daly himself says that his whole worldview has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would have told you that I'm only interested in winning a gold medal", he said.
You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daly said that his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked about was if they had tickets for the London 2012 Olympics, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be by my side, Dad, or in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and at that moment, when I realized he was dead, I finally admitted he wasn't invulnerable", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that all my life I dreamed of doing this in front of the home crowd at the Olympics, and it was the greatest feeling ever", he said.
It also inspired the choice of his first song "Proud" by Heather Small, which accompanied him during his Olympic preparations and still makes him tense.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 British Summer Time.
The lost form of Mickelson remains on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to get back to his old form if he doesn't want his record to be a failure.
Mickelson, who is participating in the two-year-old event for a record 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furrick for the foursomes and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being a key figure in the U.S. team again, the five-time major champion spent his day as a fan and practicing his long-range strikes in the hopes of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old, who was never a top right-hander even at the peak of his career, is not in optimal shape for the difficult course of Le Golf National, where the long, uneven terrain usually punishes any wrong shot.
And if the course itself isn't disturbing enough, in the ninth match on Sunday, Mickelson will face the precision British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who is teaming up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and looking to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are down by four points before the 12th game of the singles, make a strong start, it could turn out that Mickelson's match is absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his teammate, though he could hardly have said anything more.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said that he would be ready tomorrow", Furik said.
He's confident in himself.
He's a member of the Hall of Fame and he's given so much both in the past and this week.
I guess I just didn't see him playing in two games.
I expected him to play more, but it just happened, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play like everyone else.
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This could put an end to his career in the Ryder Cup, which has never come close to matching his impressive individual achievements.
Mikkelsen has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his presence brings other benefits to the team that can't be measured in numbers.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with people and is a great guy for any team", he explained.
I think the younger players were having fun with him, especially this week.
He gives a lot more than just playing.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the Europa, is aware that the great lead may soon be melted
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows from personal experience that the big lead he has built up before the singles matches of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily be erased.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama when captain Seve Ballesteros's team was five points ahead of the Americans, but it was in the final straights that he was almost caught and barely held on to win by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and we won at Valderrama, but very hard", said Bjorn, after the 2018 European team won by 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, leading by 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history needs to show me and everyone on this team that it's not all over.
Be ready for the attack tomorrow.
You go out there and do what you got to do.
Nothing is over until you see the final score on the board.
We have a goal and that goal is to try and win this trophy and that's what we have to stay focused on.
All this time I've been saying that I'm only thinking about the 12 players on our team, but we're also aware of our rivals, who are some of the greatest players in the world.
Satisfied with the players' performance on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: 'I would never rush the celebrations.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will be the highlight, and this is different.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything's going well, but when you're out on your own, that's when you put your whole golfing capacity to the test.
That's the message that we need to get to the players: tomorrow you have to give your best.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, as he too must give himself to the end.
Unlike Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furik will be looking for his players to perform better individually than as partners, with the only exceptions being Jordan Speight and Justin Thomas, who took three of four possible points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of these big reversals in the last day - he was part of the triumph of the Brookline, and then he was on the losing side when the Europeans performed the Miracle of Medinah.
"I remember every damn word", he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
We've got 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd better make the same good start you saw at Brookline and at Medinah.
When the lead shifts from one side to the other, these mid-range games are played under tremendous pressure.
So we've put together our lineup and we've distributed our guys the way we want to try and do the impossible tomorrow.
Thomas is tasked with leading our counterattack and facing off against Rory McIlroy in the all-important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will face off against the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
"I chose these players in this order because I think it gives us the greatest chance of success", Bjorn said of his choice of singles.
Germany is delaying the launch of a new warship again.
The German Navy's newest frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but that won't happen until at least next year because of broken systems and skyrocketing costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes an army spokesman.
The vessel was due to join the navy in 2014, but problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
Understandably, they will have a powerful weaponry, a suite of air and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods. The newest frigates must be able to be used for up to two years before returning to their home ports.
But the continuing delays mean that the cutting-edge warships - which are said to allow Germany to show strength overseas - will be old when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy formally refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after a delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have cited a number of significant "software and hardware defects" that make the warship unusable if sent on a combat mission.
The software shortcomings are particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be manned by a crew of around 120 seamen  only half the crew of the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, the ship was found to be significantly overloaded, which reduced its efficiency and limited the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to be twice the weight of ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
Aside from the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project - including training for the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is estimated to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from the original €2.2 billion.
The problems with the newest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was actually "running out of ships capable of carrying out missions".
The official said the problem has grown over time, as the old ships have been decommissioned but no new ones have been delivered.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could be brought into the fleet.
The National Trust is tracking the secret lives of bats
A new study conducted at a mansion in the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats use the landscape when they hunt.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common bats as well as the brown arrowheads water nightshades at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key points on the estate to track the activities of the bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also be conducting mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequencies of the bats' calls, as well as which species are making them.
A habitat map and report will then be drawn to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Duar, conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management work, e.g. the creation of meadows, and the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and Britain in general have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their shelters and lead to habitat loss.
Population risks may be posed by wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks by domestic cats.
Actually, bats are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of national importance and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The Trust has trained experts who conduct regular surveys, inspections of the shelters and, on occasion, rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only special bat reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
The manor's manager, David Thompson, says it's the perfect location for them.
"Here in Threave, we have a great terrain for bats", he noted.
We have old buildings, very old trees and a finished habitat.
But there's still a lot about bats that isn't known, so the work we're doing here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.
He emphasises the importance of checking for bats before undertaking property maintenance activities, as it is possible for the inadvertent destruction of a single sanctuary to kill up to 400 females and young bats, as well as to wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their habitats.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer with the Bat Trust, urged the public to help.
She said, "I still have a lot to learn about our bats and about many of our animal species, because we just don't know what's happening with their populations".
Ronaldo denies the rape allegations and his lawyers are suing a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "fake news", saying people want to become famous using his name.
His lawyers are suing the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published these claims.
The Portugal and Juventus forward was accused of raping American Catherine Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly then paid her $375,000 to keep the incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In an Instagram video, addressing his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were published, 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the post as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no. I was just...
What they said about me today is fake news, said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner on camera.
They want to make themselves famous by using my name.
It's only natural.
They want to make a buck behind my back, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine, smiled the footballer.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they call "unacceptable publication of suspicions in the area of private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer will seek compensation for "moral damage in an amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
It is alleged that the incident in question occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorca went to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the accident, Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her that he was a good guy in the 99 percent, but in this case he just succumbed to the one percent.
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but it was with her consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "horrified of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she wishes to cancel the agreement as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident in question.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juventus for the sum of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret the loss of its car manufacturers
Britain will "retreat forever" if it loses its status as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production at their plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", he said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of the delayed border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's director in Bournemouth.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, says they'll close their Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a 'just-in-time' basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and the EU for the cars it builds to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be problems at the border, which industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to wait more than a day to replenish its inventory at the Darbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's "chessboard" plan for the future relationship with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the success we have now, but to be able to seize this opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"From the statements of not only Toyota, but other manufacturers, we are absolutely convinced that we must be able to continue to provide successful supply chains".
Toyota cannot say how long the shutdown will last, but in the longer term, it warns that the extra costs will reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsvalaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite union at the plant, said that its members were increasingly worried: "From my experience, if these jobs go, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: 'We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be delayed again, White House says
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be postponed for another week as Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's fight continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thereby threatening Mueller's independence, has fueled rumors about Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies that claim.
But last Monday, he went to the White House after reports that he was resigning.
Instead, while Trump was at the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting with him was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which was testified to by both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazy Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday on Fox News.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "There's no date set yet, it could be this week, but seeing all the other stuff that's going on in the Supreme Court, I think it could be next week".
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed.
Some reporters would dispute this assertion: Sanders has not held a press conference from the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders replied that the rare press conferences were not out of dislike for "the demonstrative behavior" of television journalists, although he shared: "I can't say I disagree with the fact that they have demonstrative behavior".
She then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president has more Q&A sessions than any president before him", she said, adding, without citing evidence, "We've checked those statistics".
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that's far better than talking to me.
We try to do it a lot, and you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks, and it will replace the press conferences when you have a chance to talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are a rarity.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and at times bizarre behavior in front of the assembled press.
Health Minister addresses EU workers at Scotland's National Health Service on Brexit fears
The Minister for Health wrote to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wish for them to remain in place after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter to those who have less than six months left before Britain's exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to the costs of the established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in the decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: 'During the summer, the UK and EU negotiations on leaving continued, with decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government is also making progress in preparing for a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain time for all of you.
So I want to remind you how much I value the contributions of every employee, no matter what their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond contribute valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would love for you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's game, when his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27, Tennessee's Mike Organ reports.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He went to the sideline and somehow just collapsed there", Reid said.
Coaches and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie at the sideline before he was put on a stretcher and taken to the locker room for further examination.
A Tennessee State official confirmed to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had just come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the nature/severity of the injury", and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore on a college scholarship, is in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday, he made a total of five blocks before leaving the game, which makes a total of 18 blocks for him this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher coat of arms tax on the purchase of real estate in the UK
Under new plans by the Conservatives, foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty on purchases of UK property, with the extra money to help the homeless.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will affect those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The State Treasury is expecting a surplus of over 120 million British pounds a year, which will help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today the decision to make foreign buyers pay higher coat of arms tax on UK property purchases, with the extra revenue going to help the homeless.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters by promising more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The stamp duty increase will affect individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional revenue helping the government's efforts to limit the number of people who sleep on the street.
The surcharge  which is in addition to the current coat of arms tax, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for second homes and properties purchased for the purpose of giving  may amount to up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects revenues to rise by up to 120 million pounds a year.
Some 13% of new buildings in London are bought by non-UK nationals, which has led to higher prices and made it difficult for first-time buyers to enter the property market.
Many of the rich areas - especially in the capital - have become 'ghost towns' due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp duty to help more young people own their first homes.
He accused the big building companies of keeping property prices high by looting land but not using it, and asked Mrs May to abandon the affordable housing quotas to fix the UK's housing scandal.
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reform, including rent controls and an end to "no-fault" evictions.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I said I wanted to devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always have an open door to those who wish to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not right for non-British residents, or for foreign companies, to buy homes as easily as hard-working Britons.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has been pushed too far back in time, and the stigma of sleeping on the street remains too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish team".
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has said that his "biggest career ambition" is to be the senior coach of the Scotland national team.
The 42-year-old Scot has taken on the challenge of rebuilding a club from the north-east of England, who are currently in third place in the Premier League, three points from first place.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded one game for the B team and that was it", Ross told BBC Sportsound in Scotland.
But I grew up watching the Hampden Scottish games as a kid with my dad, so the national team always had a pull on me.
But that opportunity would only open up if I was successful at the club level.
Among Ross's predecessors as Sunderland managers are names such as Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Alderdice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic said he had no qualms about being the heir to such an established name at such a famous club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success right now will be measured by a positive answer to the question, "Can I get this club back in the Premier League?"
Because in structure, in base and in terms, he's definitely at the level of the Major League, he said.
It's not going to be easy to get back to the top of the game, but I'll only be successful here if I can get the team back there.
Ross has only been manager for three years, after spending some time as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months on the coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alois avoid relegation to the Third Division and turn St Mirren from a relegated team to a winner in the Championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
I was really at a crossroads, he remembers, when he took Aloe.
I really believed that being a manager was the best career for me, including being an active player.
It sounds weird, because I was doing well, making good money and had some significant success.
But being a player is hard sometimes.
There's a lot of stuff you have to deal with every week.
I still face the same levels of stress and tension at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I'm actually doing it, I've never been more comfortable in my own skin in my entire conscious life.
You can hear the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30th, on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 1:00 British Summer Time.
The ideal time for a beer is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, a study reveals
The summer heat has boosted the revenues of Britain's struggling pubs, but it's added more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenue declined 4.8%, according to the statistics.
Peter Martin of business consultancy CGA, which compiled the statistics, said: "Due to the prolonged sunshine and longer than expected England's participation in the World Cup, July follows a similar pattern to June, when pubs saw a 2.8% increase, but restaurants took an even bigger hit.
The 1.8 percent drop in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
Pubs and liquor bars had the best results in terms of growth, compared to the downward movement of restaurants.
The food pubs were also affected by the sunny weather, but not as much as the restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales jumped 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales declined 3 percent.
Paul Newman, of RSM's leisure and entertainment analysts, shared: "These results continue the trend we saw at the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home services sector.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups continue to suffer, although a 4.8% drop in sales on an annual basis can be particularly painful in addition to constant costs.
The long hot summer couldn't come at a worse time for food hall managers and only time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will bring the much-desired vacation.
The overall growth in pub and restaurant sales, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand rollout.

One in five children hides a secret social networking account from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - has a secret social networking profile that he or she hides from parents and teachers, a study reveals
A survey of 20,000 high school students shows a rise in fake Instagram accounts
The news has raised fears that material with sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of the students said they have a "basic profile" that they show their parents
One in five kids -- some one in 11 -- creates a social media profile that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students shows an increase in fake Insta accounts  link to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a clean "basic" profile that they show to their parents, and they also have secret profiles.
A mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenage boy encouraging others to rape him.
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Conference of Independent Schools (HMC), found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 have two accounts, with half of them admitting to keeping their accounts secret.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them".
Ailid Doyle will be the athlete's voice on the Scottish Athletics Board.
Ailid Doyle has been elected to join the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most accomplished track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie has described this move as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her wealth of experience at international level over the last decade.
"Ailid enjoys great respect in the athletics communities of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are convinced that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from its attraction", Beatty said.
Doyle said: 'I want to be the voice of athletes and I really hope I can contribute and help to promote sport in Scotland.'
The American, who won the 200 and 400-meter finals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, adding to his four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular commentator on the BBC, lost the ability to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if and to what extent he would recover.
It was exhausting work, but I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I am doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!
A breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows divides opinion online
A company that makes breast-feeding pumps has divided opinion online with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers to cows who are being milked.
To mark the launch of the anticipated "world's first wearable, silent breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie released a hilarious music-video ad to demonstrate the freedom the new pump gives breastfeeding mothers to express themselves.
Four real moms dance in a hay-filled cowshed, to a song with lyrics that include, "Yes, I'm getting wet, but you can't see any tail", and "If you haven't noticed, this isn't a belly, these are my breasts".
The chorus goes, "Pump, pump, pump, I'm feeding the babies with them, pump, pump, I'm feeding my girlfriends with them".
However, the ad posted on the company's Facebook page caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it downplayed the horrors of the dairy industry.
It's a very stupid decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take a few days after birth", someone wrote.
The Elvie breast pump is discreetly assembled in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "It's understandable that it's traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yeah, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?
Another added: "Such inappropriate advertising".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "extremely funny".
I think it's a great idea.
I would buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
The milk-making made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little bit of a cliché, but I'll take it as it comes.
This product is genius, someone wrote.
Another comment: "This is a funny ad targeted at mothers who masturbate (often at their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like 'cows'".
This is not an advertisement praising or condemning the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they danced with the discreet pumps placed in their bras.
The campaign concept is based on the view that many women who breastfeed feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires or pipes, and fits discreetly into a baby-breast bra, which gives women the freedom to move around, hold their babies, and even go outside while they're being weaned.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Executive Creative Director at Mother, commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative release.
By drawing a parallel between lactating and lactating cows, we wanted to bring attention to the milk-sweeping and all the challenges that go with it, while also showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski, using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children detained has jumped sharply, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because of the harsh rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration that have made it difficult to accommodate children with guardians.
Usually, most guardians are undocumented immigrants who fear they're risking their stay in the country if they want to adopt a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adults in the family would be required to provide fingerprints, which would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albenes, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Service, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have sought to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
About 80 per cent of persons who are either guardians or family members of guardians are in the country illegally, with a large proportion of them being criminal aliens.
So we'll continue to pursue these individuals", Albens said.
In an effort to expedite the registration of these children, the authorities have imposed new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than 60 days, as was the previous norm, according to shelter officials.
Many are appearing in a video conference call, rather than in person, to present their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those found unfit for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to become depressed or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter officials and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers shared that this concern is growing in large facilities, such as the one in Tornillo, where signs that a child is in trouble are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the place.
They added that moving children to the palace city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could exacerbate the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria demands that the US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualim also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the civil war is now in its eighth year.
Muallem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign troops were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "they will be dealt with".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" was almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been forcibly displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this holy battle until all Syrian lands are cleared" of both terrorist organizations and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The U.S. has about 2,000 military personnel in Syria, who are primarily training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrians opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the refugees, Moualem said conditions were tolerable and they could return, accusing "some Western countries of fanning unfounded fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help with these returns", he said.
 They are turning into a political issue what is a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no help will be given to rebuild Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to stop the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib provides an opportunity for progress in political dialogue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear timelines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaida-linked "Al Nusra Front", who would be "destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of government and opposition members soon to draft Syria's post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the members of the current constitution" and cautioning that there should be no interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By this logic, Trump will win re-election in the 2020 election, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, his presidency is prematurely terminated by impeachment and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!
At this point, there's no sign of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, prime time ratings have doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers during prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" tops the cable ratings, with up to 3.5 million viewers on prime time nights.
"It's a fire that draws people in because it's something we don't understand", says Neil Baer, executive producer of the ABC drama "The Last Candidate", which tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, who is a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
She remembers riding a Boston cab before the 2016 election.
The cab driver told her that he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
She said, "Why?"
Mrs. Swallow told me that he replied, "Because it makes me laugh".
There's fun in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, the desire to be an informed citizen is not the same as watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward, who used "deep historical information" as a source for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-skin pilot's jacket (a dress with a "Washington Post" infusion of arrogance), and Stormy Daniels's shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does to make you feel like you're part of a reality show is give you a little bit every night", said Brent Montgomery, executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", in regards to the changing cast and the daily twists (fucking the National Football League, praising Kim Jong Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you'll be left behind.
When I contacted Mr. Flies this week, he was on the north shore of Kaua'i in the 80s, but he was locked in his house watching MSNBC, while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't separate himself from the TV, especially when Brett Kavanaugh had to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court depended on it.
"I remember when we used to do all those crazy shows and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,' " Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Investments are pouring into the most contentious race in the early congressional elections.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is getting a cash flow thanks to the redistricting of congressional districts and hence two incumbents for the same seat.
The newly redistricted district in suburban Pittsburgh points to conservative Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat from another district in a by-election last spring.
Lamb faces another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which is significantly overlapping the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally rigged in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has sparked a financial dispute between the major party funding institutions, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name for himself in Pennsylvania after his hard-fought victory in the widely-discussed March by-election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts believe the Democrats have a slight advantage.
The U.S. considered imposing sanctions on El Salvador for its support of China, then backed off.
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June of 2017, and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the management team from the Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to recall the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
But sanctions were only on El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in U.S. aid for drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, including cutting financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be agonizing for the Central American country with its unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, which served as a continuation of a similar gathering last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to stem the tide of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, the top governing bodies had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice President Mike Pence has announced that he will attend the conference scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the importance the administration places on the gathering, diplomats say.
All three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the meeting, as described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who requested anonymity and agreed to participate in internal discussions.
Their accounts were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration who also wished to remain anonymous.
The history of the study
The next move could be the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, as the report is currently substantial evidence in the public record.
It's been claimed that Mr. Mueller is also focusing his investigation on whether Mr. Trump colluded with Russia during his campaign in their attack on our election.
If the leadership of Congress is changed, it will be Mr. Trump who will have to report to this body just as he prepares to face the voters, and perhaps a jury of his peers.
There are many unknowns here, and I'm not suggesting that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable, nor that of his kind in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make these choices that will affect how long the fight goes on.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if the West had stood up to him and backed the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the chance to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history depends on such pivotal moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or slowed.
Right now, the American people are facing a few of these kinds of moments.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported last year that he offered to secretly tape the president and speculated that he was not fit for the job.
Mr. Rosenstein has declared that the story in the Times is inaccurate.
How would we react if the new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh requested by the FBI is not complete or fair or if it is approved for the Supreme Court despite the allegations of sexual harassment and perjury?
And most importantly, would we vote in the Congressional elections if it would force Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have a long winter ahead of it.
But I believe we will not fail because I have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me to light the Shabbat candles on that table, wearing a swastika.
With a legacy like that, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic about the clash with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers are home to Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to continue their progress from Group D of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from playing his first match of the season ahead of the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that for Rangers this result could become a springboard to greater achievements.
"We've won an important point because Villarreal are a good opponent", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game hoping we could win something and we went out with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the match, but overall, the tie seems like a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we were better in the second.
We've got our eyes on Thursday, another big night of European football.
I hope we can fight for the three points, it will be a difficult match because they have achieved a good result in the last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience we can give our best and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely a tough one after everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but now things seem to be going in the right direction.
The team is good and the boys are having a real good time, the training is productive.
I hope we can put all our efforts into forgetting the past season and achieve the desired success.
Women are worried about their retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of what care they wanted to receive, few people discussed this with family members.
About half of the respondents to a Nationwide survey said they had discussed long-term care costs with their spouse.
Only 10 percent had spoken to their children about the subject.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they haven't taken the steps to have that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you without first expressing your wishes.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how you would like to receive care, as these decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Involve your financial adviser: Your adviser can also help you with an idea of how to pay these costs.
Your choices when choosing a financial institution for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with cash value to help you cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own funds if you have the cash.
Prepare your legal papers: Deal with legal battles early on.
Appoint a health care proxy so that you have a designated trustee to oversee the medical care you receive and to ensure that professionals respect your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the idea of a financial planner.
You can choose a trustee to make financial decisions on your behalf and guarantee that your bills will be paid if you are incapacitated.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer the questions about medications and allergies?
Put those details in writing so that you can be prepared.
'It's not just about the financial aspect, but also about who the doctors will be,' asks Martin.
What are the medications?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make a plan.

His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are trying to draw in witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to the disrupted communications, aid organizations are unable to receive information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongola, which are found on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow beach strip on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a regency that stretches for more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, which is an administrative region smaller than a province, has an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the economy of central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal area of Dongola.
Nickel mining is also important to the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morlilla, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Recovery Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongola.
A tsunami hit the western part of Dongola in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic "Pacific Ring of Fire" and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunami waves in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on December 26 off the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that slams into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake rocks one of the Mentawai Islands and activates a 10-meter wave tsunami that destroys dozens of villages and kills about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidi Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation from the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Truck Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence notice and resisting arrest, according to an Alaska State Police report released Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su Preventive Detention Facility and on an unsecured $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "not guilty, certainly" when asked to plead, media reports said.
Palin is facing three Class A felony charges, which means he could be facing up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been accused of criminal wrongdoing.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently being heard by the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence crime report and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claims he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 when she linked her son's aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed by an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications grid have been cut off, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
Social media is running videos showing the moment of the encounter.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami wave hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in the New York City terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City bombing that killed eight people - a rare punishment that hasn't been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
It is alleged that Saipov, 30, used a truck rented from Home Depot to carry out the October attacks on a bike lane near the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, running over pedestrians and cyclists in his path.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused grievous bodily harm, according to the notice of intent in connection with the death penalty petition filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, both charges could result in the death penalty.
Weeks after the bombing, an expanded federal grand jury indicted Saipoff on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder, related to racketeering, a tactic commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destroying a vehicle.
The attack required "serious planning and deliberation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's method of action as "horrible, cruel and depraved".
"Saifullo Habibulyavich Saipov has caused injury, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolás Cleves, Ann-Lauri Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Earley, Hernán Feluchi and Alejandro Damian Panuko", the notice said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last sought the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was subsequently sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in New York on a federal charge was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of conspiring and spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an ethnic Uzbek, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attacks, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt better about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, the indictment said.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"In our view, the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a conviction and life imprisonment without the possibility of parole will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events on all those affected", Patten said.
The defense team of Saipov had previously requested that the prosecution not seek the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest at the Conservative conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians should feel the pressure as one of Theresa May's own party members suggested he lead the EU negotiations.
Peter Bonn, a Conservative MP, said in Birmingham in March that Britain would have left by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs May faces to reconcile her deeply divided party ranks was highlighted by pro-Remain Conservatives who joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep his "Chequers" compromise plan despite attacks from Brexit supporters, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insist she will make progress in trying to reach a deal with Brussels despite the hostile reactions and urge Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr. Bon told the protesters, with the slogan "Leaving means leaving" in Solihull, that he wanted to throw Chequers.
He argued that Mr Farage should have been involved on an equal footing with the others and that he should have been given the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have left by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I support Brexit, but we have to throw out the Chequers plan'.
In stating his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bonn rejected claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The perception that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false".
Conservative leader Andrea Jenkins also attended the rally, telling reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers" is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists who actually went out on the streets and actually helped us get elected.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening.
In an open message to Mrs May, she added: 'Prime Ministers maintain their position when they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians must feel the pressure if they want to change the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us, the people, and our political class", he said.
"They're trying to change Brexit, and we're here today to say, 'We're not going to let you get away with this.'"
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want to make our political class, which is on the verge of a Brexit change, feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country, who helped us win Brexit, and we will never stop until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the pro-Remain rally marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists had raised flags with the words "Conservatives against Brexit" after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Tories for the security issues of the party's app when he opened up at the conference.
"These are the people who are telling us that they can deploy the IT systems and all the technology of Canada and more and more, for unimpeded border crossing, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren has said he will seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has announced that she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democratic representative spoke about her future at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a longtime critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican U.S. Rep. Jeff Deal, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She's at the center of speculation that she could take over from Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren said it was high time women went to Washington and fixed our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
An arrest has been made in the death of LSU's Simms.
LAPD in Baton Rouge, LA, announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting on Friday that killed LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20, during a press conference at 11:00 a.m. eastern time.
They posted video footage of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
Wade Simms was shot in the head, ultimately leading to his death, Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade stepped in to protect his friend and got himself shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the crime scene, carrying a gun and shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and is being held in the custody of the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6'6" Baton Rouge native, Sims started 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Lewis Hamilton is one step closer to the world title after his team's guidance helped him beat Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the Mercedes team's instructions would play a major role in the race.
Bottas made a good start from first position and seriously upset Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two corners, allowing Fettel to attack his team-mate.
Fettel made the first pit stop and left Hamilton to deal with the traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be the deciding factor for the outcome of the race.
Mercedes also made a pit stop on the next lap and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to overtake him after a bold manoeuvre and a "rubber to rubber" drive, which forced the Ferrari driver to reluctantly release the inside of the track to avoid a penalty with overtime, having already blocked his opponent's way with a dangerous double-defense manoeuvre on the third corner.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh after the end of the first lap.
After that, he was even leading for a long period of the race, because he had decided to change his tyres later than the others, which would have allowed him to be faster at the end of the race and eventually overtake Kimi Räikkönen in the battle for fourth position.
He finally made a pit stop on lap 44, but failed to make enough of a stop in the next eight laps and ultimately finished fourth.
It was a tough day, as Valtteri did a great job all weekend and showed himself to be a real gentleman when he let me overtake him.
"The team did an outstanding job to win the top two spots on the podium", Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her claim that she had not circulated the letter from Christine Blaise Ford accusing Supreme Court contender Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented on how what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "bad and disgusting and insincere".
"What can happen and the good thing that's happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry people and evil, and disgusting, and insincere", he said.
When you look at the editions and the distribution, and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it".
I didn't do it. I was wrong.
You know what?
Diane Feinstein, did you spread it?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document?
Oh, no, not that.
I didn't spread it.
Well, wait a minute.
"Did we spread... no, we didn't spread", he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent the letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was circulated earlier in September, but Feinstein denies that it was circulated from her office.
"I didn't cover up Ford's claims, I didn't spread her story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she had requested.
But her denial was not well received by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday night: "I'll tell you that was very bad body language.
She may not have done it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend the nominee for the Supreme Court accused of sexual misconduct against three women, the president pointed out that the Democrats are using the allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
"Look at the shamelessness, the shamelessness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample to regain power and control", the president said, according to Mediaite.
Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants in the Elite League
Patrick Dwyer scores two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars have recovered from Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants, winning the Dundee rematch 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead early in the game with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beaulieu.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney tied for the home team lead before Dwyer reestablished the Giants' lead.
François Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals sealed their victory.
It's the third victory in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's boys, who have come from behind to beat Dundee in Belfast 2-1 on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting between the two teams this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening shot came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with an assist from Kendall McFaul, and then David Rutherford doubled the lead, assisting Boerville four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan bringing the hosts back into the game at 1 1 0 before Matt Marquart helped level the game with a Kaunny at 1 5 1 6.
Dwyer put the Giants in the lead before the first break, scoring the second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard once again evened the odds with a powerful punch to the door at 27:37.
Kaune and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee a first-half lead for the first time this match at the end of the second half, as he gave it his all and sealed the team's victory with a fifth goal in the middle of the last half.
The Giants, who have lost their last four of their last five games, will meet host Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
A flight controller was killed to ensure that hundreds of people aboard a plane could escape an earthquake.
A flight controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board could take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many more are unaccounted for in a powerful earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Severe aftershocks continue to hit the area and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily shaken control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Joufri Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would be able to take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Traffic Control spokesman Johannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We have arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palau.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about this", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency announced that access to the cities of Dongola, Sigi and Butong was restricted.
"We expect the death toll to rise as many bodies are still under the rubble and many people cannot be reached", said SUTOPO agency spokesman Purwo Nugroho.
Waves as high as 20 feet [6 m] devastated Palu, where a mass funeral was held on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are bringing in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance is bringing more bodies.
There's a shortage of clean water.
There are robberies everywhere in the mini-markets.
Jan Gelfand, chairman of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is fighting to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is a tragedy, but it could be much worse.
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palau on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?
Earlier this year, Indonesia was rocked by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that one man is missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that flew a plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean is now reporting that one person has been reported missing, after earlier saying that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a press release, Air Niugini stated that since Saturday afternoon they have been unable to contact a male passenger.
The airline added that they are working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their efforts to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Boats from local people helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, authorities announced that seven people had been admitted to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had overtaken the runway.
American Bill Jaynes, a passenger on the plane, claims the plane went too low.
"This is very good", says Janes.
Janes says he and the others managed to walk through the deep, crust-like water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy says that sailors repairing a nearby pier also helped with the rescue effort, using an inflatable boat to get the people ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that in the past two decades, 111 people have died in flights with PNG registered airlines, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of the cases.
Analyzer sets the chronology for the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution wrapped up its case this Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett of the U.S. Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tallis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she was killed.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cell phones indicating that Telis was with Chambers the night of her death, contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the records showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the cops went to question Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Telles was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that was a lie because my truck was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy is that Telis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records indicate they've known each other for barely a week.
Rowlett pointed out that shortly after Chambers' death, Telis deleted her text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He's erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be before a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscientious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative perceptions of the genre by infusing their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claim that hip-hop has deviated from its origins of political statements and engagement with social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and promote the conscious hip-hop again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common are being revived in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
A nanny in New York sued a couple after they were fired for a racist message.
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrongly-sent message from the mother who complains that she's "the next black person".
The couple denies being racists, calling it a "blackmail" claim.
Lindsey Plasko-Flaxman, a mother of two, was stunned to learn that her new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"I'm not a black woman", Mrs. Plasko-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After realizing her mistake, a "shameful" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Morris, citing that the previous nanny, who was African-American, had not done her job well and that she was expecting a Filipino, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Morris received a day's pay and was then sent home in a taxi.
Now Morris is suing the couple for severance pay, asking for the $350 a day for the six-month arrangement she was originally hired for, even though she didn't have a contract.
'I want to show them, look, you shouldn't do that,' she told the Post on Friday, adding, 'I'm sure it's discrimination.'
In response to the lawsuit, the couple claimed that they were not racist, adding that terminating Morris' employment was a reasonable course of action, as they feared that they would not be able to trust her after they had offended her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists, husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've hurt, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it.
Calling it extortion, Plasco claims that his wife gave birth just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
You're gonna attack someone in this condition?
That's not very nice, added the investment banker.
While the case is still being heard, public opinion has been swift to condemn the couple on social media, chastising them for their behaviour and logic.
The editors of Paddington were worried that readers would not feel a connection to a talking bear, a new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter, Karen Yankel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the public, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it's published.
Now it's a lot of fun, knowing Paddington's huge success.
She shared that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a little teddy bear, would feel optimistic about the book's possible rejection, adding that he was celebrating the 60th anniversary of the publication of "Mixed Feelings" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she described as "an important member of our family", she added that her father was secretly proud of the final success.
"He was a very modest man and was not a boastful man", she said.
But because Paddington felt so real, it's like having a child who's accomplished something: you're proud of him, even though it's not your doing.
I think he kind of took Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the product of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Nad kept calling to say that the situation was really bad, that he did not expect to survive", Mrs. Eden-Laperouse said.
Then Nad called me to say she was going to die in two minutes and that I should say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said to her, "Tashi, darling, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medication that doctors gave her to support her heart slowly wears off and leaves her system.
She left a while before that, and that's how it ended.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really should have straightened up.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapperuse, who is still mourning the loss of her daughter, is boarding the plane with the other passengers, who have no idea of the ordeal she is going through.
"Nobody understood", she shared.
I was bowed my head and the whole time, tears were flowing.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt this overwhelming sense of empathy for Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her.
Grieving women post cards to prevent suicides from a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide, trying to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting up on a bridge in Wales postcards with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she says.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, says that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile lit up every room.
But he quit his job before he left, and he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
"I'm constantly worried that this will have some consequences", Ms. Davis said.
Mrs. Davis created the cards to let people know that there's someone to go to and someone to talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't keep silent  you have to speak.
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her life partner of 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
"He didn't share that he felt depressed or depressed or anything", she said.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas when the children opened their presents, he didn't look at them or anything.
She said that this was a terrible trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: It opens a gap in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to keep going and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in question as the FBI begins an investigation
"I was wondering if we could really achieve what he wants - an investigation of limited duration and limited scope - maybe we could pool our efforts", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was falling apart despite the entrenched bipartisan blockade.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is for the moment.
The primary is only five weeks away, on November 6th. If, as expected, Republicans do not do well, their efforts to elect their representative to the state's highest court will be severely compromised.
George W. Bush calls senators to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works for Mr. Bush in the White House and, with his help, met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes their report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where the membership currently stands at 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to declare parity and confirm his nomination for the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors is decreasing under Kim.
A South Korean lawmaker claims that the number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byung-sook, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 fugitives last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
According to Mr. Park, tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher sums demanded by human smugglers, are key factors.
There's been no official comment from Pyongyang.
Most of the North's refugees eventually become South Korean citizens.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ) that separates the two Koreas.
China treats fugitives as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the impasse in nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This came after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed in principle to work towards a Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the US, we will not have confidence in our national security and under these circumstances there is no way to unilaterally disarm", Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was too unstable to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had reacted in this way, they would have called her 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his commencement address, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost screaming and getting emotional when he discussed his family and his years as a student.
He also strongly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "a co-ordinated and co-ordinated attack on his character" by liberals who are unhappy that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi argued that in her opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because it was clear that he was prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these allegations and the way he's going after the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi denied that when asked if she would try to discredit Kavanaugh if he were appointed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll put it this way, if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's unfit not only to sit on the Supreme Court, but to sit on the court that he's on", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential rulings regarding the Affordable Care Act or the "Row v. Wade" case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced man to walk into court and expect us to say, 'Isn't it wonderful?'", Pelosi concluded.
And women have to learn to control themselves.
It's a well-founded criticism after months and years of raging rage, and she can't take it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's unusual, do you?
She went on, "I had a tremendous help from a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she cries when she's angry, but she's developed a technique where when she's angry and she cries, she says to her interlocutor, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you.
And then it just goes on.
I thought it was genius.
Tears are allowed in anger, partly because they're misunderstood in the first place.
One of my clearest memories of my previous job, in an office mostly staffed by men, is how once, as I was sobbing with unspoken rage, an older woman grabbed me by the neck - a chilling supervisor I've always been a little afraid of - and she dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to do it to you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a yacht called the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided there was no reason why she should not consider running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she told me 30 years later, laughing.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they wanted to happen was for another one to show up.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
As a late entrant, she was behind in her fundraising efforts and decided that she would not stay in the race if she could not raise $2 million.
The battle is doomed to fail.
She understands that some of her supporters who give $1,000 to men would only give $250 to her.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During her speech, in which she announced that she would not be campaigning officially, she was overwhelmed by so many feelings - gratitude to the people who supported her, resentment against the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to be able to appeal to voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism that she felt.
"One might think I was having a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schroeder recalls the media reaction.
One might think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my tombstone?
She cried?
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first shots in the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and while the battle is only gaining momentum, a rift between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, has fired the first warning shot this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest escalation of tensions came this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) in output, effectively taxing half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Each time, Beijing retaliated with new tariffs of five to 10 percent on US goods worth 60 billion US dollars.
China has vowed to respond to any U.S. strike, and it's not likely that the world's second-largest economy will soon ignore that.
To make Washington give up is to yield to demands, but to bow in public to Washington would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure from the trade war with the US could help China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in both Washington and Beijing could create the conditions for an economic crisis in either country is actually more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged", said Abigail Grace, a senior fellow on Asia at the Center for a New American Security think tank.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria has announced that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouallem noted that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas devastated by the terrorists to return them to normal.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian aid.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any help in rebuilding the devastated state.
But he stressed that no conditional aid or assistance would be accepted from countries that have funded the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
So the United States has six straight losses on European soil and hasn't won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the championship crown after the team, led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, reached the required 14.5 points, which guaranteed victory over the United States.
The USA star Phil Mickelson, who had been a weak performer for most of the tournament, made his first shot at the 16th hole (with a par 3) in the water, which resulted in his loss to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all rounds, becoming one of only four players in tournament history to reach a 5-0-0 record since the competition was held in its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Speight lost 5 and 4 to the lowest ranked player in Europe, Torbjorn Olsen of Denmark.
World leader Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, for whom this is probably the last Ryder Cup.
Spain's Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cup appearances, became the highest-scoring European player of all time, taking his tally to 25.5 points this year.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can lift the trophy again.
"The team is what matters most and I'm happy I was able to help", said the excited Garcia after the European victory.
He hands the baton to his compatriot John Ramm, who beat American legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in the singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching him play", said the 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and his Ryder Cup total is now 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA has been struggling all weekend, except for Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have been playing top-class golf all day of the tournament.
Team USA captain Jim Furyk shared after the team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
At one point this morning, we were pressing the Europe team.
There was a fight.
I'm putting my hat on Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players performed very well.
We'll regroup, discuss important issues with the Professional Golfers Association of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll just look ahead.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You can't help but take your hat off to your opponent.
We were just over the edge.
