Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried about being humiliated
There was a stir among some members of the Welsh Assembly to change its name to MWP (Welsh Parliamentary Assembly).
This issue came about after a plan to change the name of the assembly to the Assembly of the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Welsh Assembly across the political spectrum are worried about being humiliated.
One member of the Labour Party said that MWP is a bit of a confusion with the English words Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside of Wales: "twp" is Welsh for "to be" and "pwp" is Welsh for "to be".
A member of the Scottish Assembly, wearing the national dress, said that the group was completely dissatisfied and suggested other names.
The Welsh Conservative said that his group was in favor of changing the name, but that the abbreviation sounded like "to agree".
In this context, the Welsh "w" is pronounced similarly to the "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to change the name, said, "The final decision of the regulators is, of course, in the hands of the members of the Assembly as to what the members of the Assembly are to be called".
The Welsh Government has given the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name under the Wales Assembly Act 2017.
In June, the Commission published a summary of the recommendations of a public consultation, which found that it supported the name of the assembly as the Parliament of Wales.
The Commission preferred the designation of Members of the Assembly, Members of the Welsh Parliament or "WMP", but the "MWP" proposal received a lot of support in public consultation.
The Assembly members are likely to propose alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus may be a headache for the chair, Elaine Jones, who is ready to introduce a bill on the amendments within a week.
Legislation for the reforms included changes to how the Assembly should function, including rules for the disqualification of Assembly members and the creation of a commission system.
The members of the Assembly make the final decision on the name of the bill after the bill is discussed.
Macedonians vote on a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The famous election was created to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece because they have a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of its northern neighbor is a threat to its territorial integrity and has repeatedly opposed its membership in the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Georg Ivanov, told the opposition to the referendum to ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the name change was a price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The Harlem church has been silent since the St. Martin Falls bell was struck
"Old people I talk to usually tell me that there are churches on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
"There is none today".
You can understand why the Xabar are gone".
Today, people speak in a different way.
The people were no longer in the city, nor were there any places to rest.
In the case of the churches, the leaders fear that the proceeds from the sale of property will not last as long as they had hoped, and that "they will eventually be back where they started".
Instead of churches, he says, there are apartment buildings filled with people who don't help the shelters that are left.
Most people who buy condos in these buildings are white", he said. "So people who move into these condos are unlikely to be members of these churches, so the closing of churches is accelerating".
Both churches were built before Harlem became the black metropolis of the Metropolitan Society in 1870, 10 years later St. Martin.
The first white Methodist church moved in in 1930.
The building was occupied by a black religious organization that had a nearby congregation.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black religious organization led by St. John Howard Johnson, who had opposed the merchants on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
In 1939, a fire severely damaged the building, but members of the church community who visited Father Johnson planned to rebuild it and set up bells.
St. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and a follower of St. Martin, was proud to call the carillon "the bell of the poor".
In July, an expert on the carillon called it a cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
Tiffany N., an expert from the University of Michigan, has identified this as the world's first carillon played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved into a larger carillon in a Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had no replacement.
In recent months, St. Martin's has had a complex history of architects and builders, some brought in by the clergy and others by the bishop's diocese.
The Ryznica was a governing body of the local leaders, who were the people who came to the church. Although Ryznica did not begin to hire architects and performers sent by the diocese, they wrote to the diocese in July asking for the payment of the expenses to be transferred to the Ryznica.
Some churchgoers have complained about the lack of clarity in the bishop's approach.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old lobster hunter in California
Officials say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was diving to catch lobsters in California on Saturday, the opening of lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. in Encinitas, near Beacon Beach.
Chad Hammell told KSWB-TV in San Diego that while he was in the water for about a half hour with his friends on a Saturday morning, he heard a boy scream for help and drove his team to the water to get him out.
Hummel says that at first he thought the boy was screaming for joy because he had been bitten by a lobster, but he soon realized that he was screaming, "I've been bitten!"
"I was bitten!"
"By the time she reaches the age of five, her entire brain is completely disconnected", says Hammel.
"I shouted out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water,'" said Hummel.
The child was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is now in critical condition.
It is not known what kind of shark attacked.
Rescue captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen a few weeks ago, but that it was considered a harmless species.
Gilles added that the victim had a severe wound to his chest.
Officials closed the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Yesinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered threatened.
Sainsbury is planning to enter the UK beauty market.
Sainsbury's is making a push with its department store-style beauty line of professional assistants, which is now headed to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams.
As part of a major entry into the UK's growing £2.8 billion beauty market, while fashion and three products are selling less, larger lines of beauty products are being tested in 11 stores across the country, with more expected next year if successful.
And when supermarkets started putting up shelves free of TVs, microwaves, and other household items, beauty products started to come into play.
Sainsbury's says it will double its beauty offerings to over 3,000 products, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and for the first time ever, the Dr.PawPaw brand.
The existing L&39;Oreal, Maybelline, Burt&amp; apos;s Bees range will also be given more space in the same branded areas as Boots.
The supermarket is also reopening its vegetarian coloring section for boutiques that are in high demand among younger customers.
In addition, two Sainsbury's stores are competing for the Fragrance Shop, one opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the other is opening later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Because of the increasing demand for online shopping and the need to shop in small quantities in local stores, supermarkets are having to work harder to attract customers.
According to Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coop, Sainsbury's's network is making outlets like department stores, while supermarkets are offering more services and food to compete with discount stores like Aldi and Liddle.
Since Sainsbury's bought both chains two years ago, they've put Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and introduced a number of Habitat chains, which has kept the food supply and increased the revenue from the addition.
The supermarket's previous efforts to improve the beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's had a partnership with Boots in the 2000s, but they broke up because they couldn't share the profits from their pharmacy in their supermarket.
Sainsbury's's new strategy came after it sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celestia, owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
He said that Lloyds would play a key role in the plan by adding a wide range of high-end facial care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief commercial officer of Sainsbury's, said, "We've completely changed the look and feel of our beauty departments for our customers.
We also invested in a trained staff who were willing to give advice.
Our brands are designed to meet the needs of everyone, and our appealing environments and location mean we're a comfortable beautification against the old-fashioned sales pitch.
Peter Jones was furious that Holly Willoughby had signed a $11 million contract.
When host Holly Willoughby signed a $11 million deal, she was furious that she was seeking a new deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV, besides the clothing line.
Willowby doesn't have time to focus on her clothing brand Truly and accessories.
Their business was similar to Gwyneth Peltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby, who co-owned the lucrative lifestyle brand with Peter Jones of Dragons Den, left at the last minute to focus on her new amazing contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, the gold medalist was furious when Jones admitted at a meeting at her headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that her new £1.5 million contract was no longer for the Truly clothing and accessories brand.
This business was likened to Gwyneth Peltrow's Goop brand, doubling Willoughby's fortune by £11 million.
37-year-old Willoughby, announcing on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, flew from Britain to one of Jones' vacation homes.
The source said: "Truly has been a priority for Holly.
He had his long-term future tied to it, and he would work for at least another 20 years.
When he left, he opened his mouth and amazed everyone.
No one could believe what had happened on Tuesday, and it was about to begin.
The Marlowe headquarters has a stockpile of products ready to go on sale.
Experts believe that the departure of one of Britain's most profitable stars, This Morning, will cost the company several million dollars, due to the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and lamps to clothing, and the opening may be further delayed.
And long-standing friendships also end.
Willoughby and Dan Baldwin Jones, a mother of three, had been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for about ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Kapp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
Friends go on vacations together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby was to become a brand ambassador for M&S and would play Ant McPartlin in ITV's I'm Famous.
A source close to Jones said that evening, "We do not comment on his business".
We had a long talk and then fell in love.
He joked about the media criticism he received for some people making what he thought were "unpresidential" remarks and being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump obey so much?
Trump said with a whispering voice:
I was not obedient to anything.
Trump praised the first summit in Singapore in June as a major step toward denuclearization, and Kim said he was open to a second meeting.
But the denuclearization talks have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea's ambassador Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not received any response from the United States regarding disarmament measures.
Instead, the United States maintained its pressure-sensitive sanctions.
Trump's speech was a lot more optimistic.
He said, "We're the best with North Korea".
We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions would die.
We're in the best relationship we've ever had.
Efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results, ending missile tests, free hostage rescue, and the return of American service members home.
He justified his special relationship with Kim.
It's easy to be president, but we'd rather have 200 people in this room than 10,000 people who can't get in this square out there, Trump said, pointing to the crowd at that moment.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia devastated the island, killing hundreds.
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were no longer needed.
Although over 10 percent of the population of Lombok was displaced, it was not declared a national disaster, a condition of international assistance.
In many cases, unfortunately, it was very clear that they were not going to ask for international help, so it was a little complicated", Ms. Sumbaung said.
The Sakta organization is recruiting children to travel to Palu, but it is not clear if foreign workers can work there.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said that Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu and whether international aid could be provided.
The earthquakes in Indonesia are so frequent that the country is unprepared for natural disasters.
A tsunami shelter was built in Ashe, a city that was not found anywhere else on the coast.
In Palo, the lack of a tsunami warning system on the day of the tsunami caused many deaths.
Although the weather is excellent, traveling between many of Indonesia's islands is extremely difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship from Lombok was on its way to Palu to help the victims, but it took at least three days to reach the new site.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's damaged infrastructure a priority of his campaign and has invested heavily in improving roads and railways.
But funding shortfalls are a nuisance to Mr. Joko's administration as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also under longstanding pressure from religious leaders in Indonesia, a country with a Muslim majority that is more conservative.
In a street fight between Christian and Muslim gangs, more than 1,000 people were killed and over 10,000 were displaced.
See this: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool is tied with Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London, in the last 89 minutes.
Sturridge caught a pass from Dhan Shaqiri, 30 yards (27 m) from Chelsea's goal, and made the score 1-0.
He took the ball to the left as he rode to the far goal.
The ball flew high and landed on the right side of the net.
He jumped the ball and flew over the Arrizabalaga to the top.
"It was a situation where we had to try to get the ball, and players like Shaq gave their best, so I gave my best", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and immediately jumped at the opportunity".
Chelsea led 1-0 in the 25th minute with the help of Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The ball passed through the middle of the field and reached half of the Liverpool line before Blue gave a pass to attacking back Matteo Kovacic.
The quarterback quickly took the pass from the middle of the plate and passed it back.
Then he passed the ball in a stealthy manner, and Hazard hit it out of the bag.
Hazard passed the defender and then with his left foot he passed Liverpool's Alison Becker to the goal.
Liverpool and Napoli will play in the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 pm at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea and Videoton will play in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 pm in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said Sunday.
Many people were trapped outside destroyed buildings in the 7.5-magnitude quake that hit the area on Friday, causing waves up to 20 feet high, said agency secretary Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a conference.
The city of Palo, with its 380,000 inhabitants, was left in ruins.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murdering a woman.
An investigation was launched when a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found with knife wounds at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police asked people in the area to come and report if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is still in its early stages, but I would urge anyone who has been in John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have had their vehicle's security camera capture information that may be very important to our investigation, to contact us.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman's body was found in Birkenhead and that she was found inside the property.
Friends of the woman who was found this morning came in this afternoon to ask where she was found.
The police are preparing to speak to the relatives of the victims.
Grayson tried to break into the cab driver's apartment in Meuse, but the police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was amazed at what had happened.
Residents were told that they would be allowed to return to their homes within a few hours.
I heard a police officer say that the whole area is now being treated as a crime zone.
A woman came to the crime scene crying.
And she kept saying, "This is weird".
At two o'clock in the afternoon, two police vans were inside the cordon, and another outside.
A few police officers were inside the cordon, guarding the high-rise building.
Anyone with information is asked to contact DM @MerPolCC, call 101, or call the Stop Undercover Crime number 0800 555 111 with a log in date of September 30th 247.
The Cromwell monument in Parliament is the latest hit in the "rewrite history" campaign.
It would be fair to remove it because its puritan fans had destroyed many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, just like the Taliban.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "crazy" and "a distortion of history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said, "The current debate about the removal of statues is clearly about removing the statue of Oliver Cromwell from outside the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell neither ordered nor directed the destruction of holy places during the English Civil War.
Perhaps another Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William H. Thornecroft's brilliant portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th-century view and is part of the historical record of a man many today feel deserves to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph, "Many people, perhaps more people, in the late 19th century knew Cromwell as a defender of the monarchy, of course, against outside pressure from Parliament.
Whether or not this is actually a reflection is a subject of ongoing historical debate.
In any case, the conflict in the mid-17th century set off a new wave of social development, and Cromwell was a prominent figure on one side of a divided society.
His achievements as Lord Protector are worthy of celebration and remembrance.
A pig bites a Chinese shepherd and kills him.
According to local media, a pig attacked a cattle farmer in a market in southwestern China and killed him.
The man, identified only by his father's name, "Yuan", was found with his body cut off and covered in blood in a market pigsty in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, reports the South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer in Qinghai Province, China, was preparing to vaccinate pigs on May 30, 2005.
On Wednesday, she and her household sold 15 pigs at a market in the neighboring province of Yunnan.
The next morning, the others found the pigsty open.
There was a large male pig in the pigsty with a blood-stained mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig had been bitten to death.
"The room had a leg that was bruised and bruised", says a resident named Wu, as reported by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
Her body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed Yuan did not belong to him or to any of them.
The market manager told the Night Beasts that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking other people, while the police were collecting evidence.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this is rare, pig attacks on humans have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a husband and wife on a farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring a man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig hit a Welsh farmer's tractor, and his wife threatened to drive him away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but they can't stop when they taste blood.
"They're just a game.
They're like children, very curious ... they don't want to hurt.
You just have to treat them with a little respect".
The remnants of Hurricane Rose are bringing heavy rains to the southwest of the United States.
Forecasts suggest that the storm will gradually fade as it moves into the cool waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the storm is expected to bring torrential rain and flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
The storm hit at 85 miles per hour at 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, a Category 1 storm, about 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move northward on Sunday.
At the same time, it began to form over the Pacific Ocean and move toward the west coast of the United States. As Rose approached the Baja Peninsula in California as a tropical storm on Monday, the tropical storm began to move northward toward the southwestern United States.
The Rose will bring up to 10 inches (27 cm) of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in the coming days, tropical moisture combined with the approaching pressure will produce torrential rains that will sweep across the southwest.
Between one and four inches of rain can cause dangerous floods, floods, and landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona, can result in heavy rainfall of up to 10 to 15 inches per hour.
In some parts of the southwest, especially much of Arizona, rainfall is expected to be between two and four inches.
The rapid spread of the tropical rain can cause sudden floods.
With such a threat of tropical rain, going out into the wilderness alone is the worst option.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging rivers, and lightning strikes can bring down a hurricane.
The approaching cyclone will bring heavy rains to some parts of the southern coast of California.
When the rain reaches a depth of about two inches, the current brings with it fine debris and makes the roads slippery.
This will be the first rains of the wet season in the region.
Some scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, with heavy rainfall on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
As the Arctic cools in October, the weather in the United States fluctuates, but the tropics remain very warm.
Sometimes this causes a sudden change in temperature for a short time.
A good example is the sudden temperature change in the central United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Moyne, Iowa is about 20 degrees.
In the next few days, the summer heat will begin to recover and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States will see temperatures reaching as high as 80 degrees Celsius in October, extending from the southern hemisphere to the northeastern part.
On Tuesday, New York City will warm to 80 degrees, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our forecast is that temperatures will be much higher than normal in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people watched the Supreme Court trial of Brett Kavanaugh on Thursday on six television networks, who was accused of sexually assaulting Christine Blasey Ford in 1980.
Meanwhile, as the political conflict continues, reporters are interrupting a live broadcast of Friday's program, which calls for a week's investigation by the FBI based on a proposal with Senator Jeff Flake.
Kavanaugh was drunk and ripped off his clothes at a high school party, and Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% confident.
Kavanaugh said with 100% confidence that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen, over 20.4 million people watched the broadcast on Friday.
The company had an average of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other channels listed, including PBS, C-SPAN, Fox Business Network, are not immediately available.
Nielsen also has no idea how many people she sees in the offices.
And with that in mind, it was the same audience as the football game or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, which had strong media support for Kavanaugh's appointment, was watched by an average of 5.69 million viewers during its daytime prime time.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
After the trial, the interest rate was still high.
Flake was the central character in the Sunday drama.
After the Republican caucus filed a petition to nominate Kavanaugh, he tried to get on the elevator on his way to the Judiciary Committee hearing, but was caught on camera by the screams of the protesters on CNN and CBS.
He was standing there for a few minutes watching a fight on CNN.
"I am here before you", said the woman.
Do you think he is telling the country the truth?
Jesus said to him, "Women are weak, but you are strong".
Before the elevator door closed, Flake's office filed a complaint and said it would have more to say at the committee hearing.
When Kavanaugh's nomination was put to a vote in the Senate, the Judiciary Committee had to vote, and cable and live networks were broadcasting it live hours later.
But Flake said that some Democrats would vote for him only after the FBI completed a week-long investigation.
Flake came to this conclusion after a discussion with his Democratic friend, Senator Chris Kuhn.
After consulting with Coons and a number of senators, he made this decision.
Flake's influence was strong, for Kavanaugh did not have enough Republican votes to win the election.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "playing politics" by using Brexit.
Prime Minister May accused Brexit planners and critics of "playing politics" by undermining Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party convention in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In an interview on the front page of the same newspaper, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson sharply criticized his Chequers plan for Brexit and called his proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs an attack on "the fraud".
Wade Sims shooting: Police arrest Dayton Simpson as a suspect in the death of a LSU football player.
Police arrested a suspect in the death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reports that 20-year-old Dayton Simpson has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder.
The official showed a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson, in which the police said that Sims lost his glasses.
The police found the glasses at the scene of the fight and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, CBS affiliate.
After Simpson was questioned, the police said that he confessed to shooting Wade.
His lawyer said that the bail was $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday that the cause of death was a second gunshot wound to the neck.
The department was particularly impressed by the help of the Louisiana State Police task force, the State Crime Lab, the Southern University Police, and local citizens who helped and accelerated the investigation.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their "activeness and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6'2" kid grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points per game last season and improved that to 2.6 points per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was devastated and shocked by Wade's death.
"This is always a concern", Wade said.
A volcano in Mexico City erupted.
The eruption of the Popocatepetl volcano reached southern Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday, with 183 ash and gas eruptions reported in the past 24 hours.
There were several throbbing sounds and tremors in the center.
Social media images show cars in slums like Ho Chi Minh City outside Mexico City covered in a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers southeast of Mexico City since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake in September 2017.
Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists just before the independence vote.
On Saturday, pro-independence protesters clashed with police in Barcelona, six people were arrested, and thousands marched to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan independence vote.
Masked separatists attacked police with eggs and gunpowder, which spewed black smoke and dust through crowded tourist streets.
The police used batons to stop the protesters, and a fight broke out.
For hours, groups chanting "We will not forget, we will not forgive" clashed with demonstrators chanting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were slightly injured and were treated, local media reported.
A year ago, on October 1, Catalans voted for independence, and since then the region has been in turmoil, with Madrid rejecting the referendum as illegal, but Catalan separatists celebrating the protest.
Most voters chose to be independent, but there was little turnout because of the boycott.
According to Catalan authorities, police clashed with voters at polling stations in the region when they tried to stop voting, injuring nearly 1,000 people.
Support groups for the violence organized a camp on Friday night to help prevent violence in support of national law enforcement.
The demonstration continued, but they had to take a different route.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician, said he and his wife were at the rally and that they were not sure Catalonia would be independent.
"Last year was a great year.
"I saw my parents cheer and cheer that they could vote for independence, but now we're stuck".
This is a small but important victory in the elections of December last year, and the original leaders of the Catalan independence parties are being persecuted or arrested and tried for organizing the referendum, but they are trying to keep the momentum going this year.
The 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, recorded a phone call in support of the police about the conflict, saying that the politicians on both sides were behind it.
He said, "It's getting worse".
On Saturday, Oriol Jankeras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been on trial since last year, announced his candidacy for the European Parliament next year.
Running for European elections is the best way to protest against the Spanish government's repression and degradation of democratic values.
London: Several people were arrested after they drove into a house.
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after driving through a Londonersry home several times.
The incident occurred at around 7:30 p.m. on Thursday in the Belligard Crescent.
The gate and the building itself were damaged, said Deputy Inspector Bob Blemmins.
The gunman was not in the vehicle.
The Menganes beat the Rangers 1-0 against the Livingstons.
Dolly Mangala's first goal brought a win for Livingston.
Livingston surprised the Rangers, their second loss in 18 games since Steven Gerrard took over as manager of the Ibrox.
Dolly Mangala's shot was different, because Gary Holt took the team to the next level with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side have been out of the Premier League this season and they face Hart on Sunday, they are eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers will beat Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, who is also the head coach of Holt, has extended his winless streak to six games, and has been enjoying the win since he replaced Kenny Miller a month ago.
Livingston is far from a rude audience.
Holt's team had a long way to go before they scored a goal, but the Rangers had a problem.
Scott Robinson came out and stopped the ball, and then Alan Lisgow went over the edge and slid into Craig Halt's head.
The Rangers felt satisfied just playing in front of the home crowd, because they could distract the crowd.
And that's the main goal.
The Rangers allowed a penalty, and Livingston scored, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson joining to claim Mangan, and he scored.
The Rangers were dominant at the time, but goalkeeper Liam Kelly, who knew the defense was unstoppable, was rarely in trouble.
This pattern continued in the second half of the game, and Alfredo Morelos actually saved Kelly.
Scott Pittman was the Rangers' goalie, and Allan McGregor was a foot-wrencher, and Lithgow was another Livingston.
The Crosses were getting closer and closer to Livingston's quarter and they were getting closer and closer to the defense, and they needed two penalties - one for Halkett when he came in to replace Glenn Middleton, and one for the catch.
The phenomenal analysis of Livingston.
Alasdair Lamont, a BBC Scotland correspondent, is in the Tony Makaron Arena.
It was a great game and a great result for Livingston.
The hardest part for humans was extending the trajectory of a longing.
Their style and personnel have not changed since they entered the senior team, and the biggest contribution is Holt, who has sharpened the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was unbeatable, and he was the best defensive player I've ever had, and he took over Connor Goldson and Joe Warrall.
The Ranger lacked enthusiasm and motivation.
They were the best in the world at the time, but they didn't live up to that standard.
They didn't get the ball, and the only time they were on the other side of the field, that was a warning bell for the Rangers.
The reception was mixed in the Erdoğan Lake.
The Turkish and German leaders met for a breakfast in Berlin, which was a Saturday with a smile and a blue sky.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany, which aims to restore relations with NATO and its allies.
They were fighting for human rights, freedom of speech and Turkey's accession to Europe.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city became home to the largest Turkish population in the world.
Police were busy with security as 25,000 people gathered outside the mosque, while many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of people opposed to Erdogan, including Kurds, spoke out, criticizing Erdogan's policies and protesting the German government's use of him.
This duel is a story of people who see him as a hero, some Germans who see him as an autocrat.
Deppford Accident: A cyclist is killed when he is hit by a car.
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at the corner of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, immediately off Deptford Road, at about 10:15 a.m. southeast of the city.
The driver stopped, and the paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
A similar accident occurred a few months ago, a mile away on Childers Street, when a car hit another cyclist and drove off, killing him.
The Metropolitan Police were working to identify the man and notify his family.
The roads were blocked, buses were diverted, and drivers were asked to go around the road.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in the riot.
Six prison guards were injured in the riot at the maximum security prison, the prison office said.
The riot started at around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday at the Worcestershire HM Hospital Long Lartin and is still ongoing.
Tornado officials were called to quell the panic caused by eight prisoners in one wing of the building.
The workers are being treated for minor facial injuries.
A prison press secretary said that a trained prison staff had come to the Long Lartin Correctional Facility to investigate this case.
Six workers were treated for their injuries.
We don't tolerate this kind of violence in prisons, and the people responsible for it are handed over to the police and spend a long time in prison.
The Long Lartin Detention Center holds more than 500 people, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, a prisoner reported to the warden that he had been hospitalized after being injured in an attack.
In October last year, Omon officials were called to the prison to address the issue, when the staff was attacked by pool gangs.
The storm is threatening to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (which may benefit drylands).
Tropical depression rarely hits Arizona, but this time early next week, the energy trail left over from Storm Rosa could sweep through the southwest of the desert, bringing severe flooding.
The National Weather Service issued forecasts of flash flooding on Monday and Tuesday, affecting southern and eastern Nevada from western Arizona, southeastern California and Utah, as well as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
On Tuesday, Rose continues her journey through Phoenix, arriving with rain on Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that 10 tropical cyclones are maintaining tropical storm status, or cyclone status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the border with AZ.
The latest National Storm Models predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, Mogollon Rome up to 6 inches in Arizona.
In other southwestern regions of the desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is only 1 to 2 inches, but can reach up to 4 inches in isolated areas.
Rose rains may be best in areas that are prone to flooding because of drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, it is also beneficial in some areas, such as the southwest, which is currently experiencing severe drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing severe drought, the second highest category".
First, the storm Rosa is causing a landslide in the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, the storm rose to 85 mph winds, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and 12 miles north.
The storm is being weakened by the icy waters of the Pacific Ocean.
So on Monday afternoon or evening, a tropical storm will sweep through Mexico.
In many parts of Mexico, heavy rains cause flooding.
"A total of three to six inches of rainfall is expected from Baja California northwest of Sonora, rising by 10 inches", reports weather.com.
Rose then moved northward from Mexico as a tropical storm, becoming a tropical cyclone early Tuesday morning before reaching the Arizona border, and then moving across Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday evening.
"The main threat from Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States", says the National Hurricane Center.
The rainfall is expected to cause life-threatening floods and landslides in the mountains.
Four suspects arrested in connection with attempted murder in Midsomer Norton
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested after a 16-year-old was found dead from an attempted murder in Somerset.
The teenager was found with multiple gunshot wounds on the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton at 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
The injured man was taken to the hospital, where he remains in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old and a 20-year-old suspect were arrested in Redstock, Avon and Somerset overnight, the Home Office said.
Police officers are encouraging people to come forward and cooperate if they have recorded information or events on their mobile devices.
Trump says Kavanaugh was suffering from "the tension and anger of the Democratic Party".
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party's brutal, ruthless tactics", Trump said during his campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said during his inauguration that Kavanaugh was "under the spell of the Democratic Party".
Kavanagh addressed members of Congress on Thursday, emotionally denying the guilt of Christine Blasey Ford, who she claims raped her as a teenager 10 years ago.
Ford himself testified under oath at his own arraignment.
The president said on Saturday, "All Americans saw the courage and character of Kavanaugh that day".
"The vote to nominate Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to nominate the most distinguished legislator of our time. A lawyer who has worked tirelessly for the community", he told his supporters in West Virginia.
He also spoke about the significance of the Republican Party's victory in the midterm elections and the appointment of President Kavanaugh.
We are only five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
I am not racing in a race, but I am running in a race that is not in the race".
That's why I'm fighting everywhere for the best candidates.
Trump says the goal of the Democrats is to "stop the opposition".
The first Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be counted no later than Friday, the secretary of the Republican Party's leadership office told CNN.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia kill hundreds, and the death toll is rising
At least 384 people were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said Saturday, many of them swept ashore by powerful waves.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palo, where waves of up to six meters (18 feet) in height swept over the city in the early morning, killing and destroying many people.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5, was followed by a tsunami.
"The tsunami killed people who were still working on the coast", Indonesian disaster management agency secretary Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come by itself, it swept away cars, trees, houses, and hit everything on the coast", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami hit the coast at 800 km/s on the high seas.
Some people escaped by climbing into a tree.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial images released by the disaster agency showed buildings and shops destroyed, bridges collapsed, and mosques flooded.
On Saturday, the coastal city was hit again.
Several aftershocks were felt in the area of 2.4 million people.
In a statement, the Indonesian Agency for Technology Application and Measurement reported that the energy produced by Friday's earthquake was 200 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city along a long, narrow coastline may have contributed to the tsunami's severity.
Nugroho described the devastation as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shops, and hotels were destroyed.
The report said that the number of dead was found under the collapsed buildings, and that there were 540 injured and 29 missing.
The disaster was likely to be more severe in the coastal area of Donggala, 300 kilometers from Palu, near the epicenter.
"The road has been completely cut off", said Nugroho.
The Red Cross said that more than 300,000 people live in the affected areas, and that staff and volunteers are being dispatched to the affected areas.
"It's already a big problem, but it could be worse".
Although the agency was criticized by the community for not reporting the tsunami in Palu on Saturday, officials said the waves came at the right time.
A video recorded by a witness shows a man on the top floor of a building shouting a warning to people on the street.
The wall of water reached the shore in a matter of minutes, sweeping away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters was not able to immediately identify the video's owner.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a complete power outage, cutting off communication with Palu, and making rescue efforts even more difficult.
The military has begun sending supplies via pilots from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but people still need food and basic necessities.
The city's airport reopened for emergency services and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to arrive at the evacuation center in Palo on Sunday.
The tsunami in Indonesia claimed over 800 lives.
This is terrible.
Although World Vision workers made it to Palo, they saw the devastation along the way, said Mr. Doseba.
They told me they saw many cattle being destroyed.
This is terrible.
Although relief workers have begun mitigating the effects of the disaster, some have reported that foreign aid workers have been hindered in reaching Palu.
Indonesian law allows foreign aid, personnel, or funds to arrive only if a disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
We have not yet.
"It was declared a local disaster", said Auliya Aryani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
The government said, "OK, if it's a national emergency, we'll be open to international help, but we're not there yet".
On the second night after the devastating earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of the missing in Palo have not given up hope that they will be found, a rare miracle.
On Saturday, a young boy was rescued from a water pipe.
On Saturday, rescuers pulled out a woman and her mother who had been dead for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national sailing team, was training missing sailing pilots for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were Mr. Mandagi himself and his students.
"As someone who has worked a lot in parachuting, this is a particularly challenging challenge for me", she said.
Mr. Hendon told me that before the Roa Roa Hotel collapsed, he was sending WhatsApp messages to other sailors at the Palo Beach Festival.
But instead of the two blue signs that said "Received", there was only one gray sign.
"There is no information", he said.
Livi was robbed of $26,750 while filling an ATM in Newport Street.
Livi was filling a Brink's ATM on Friday in Newport Street when thieves stole $26,750, according to a news release from Newport Police.
The driver was preparing to withdraw more cash from the ATM at the casino, detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was filling the box, another Brink's employee ran after him and stole the money from the distribution box.
Witnesses reportedly identified several suspects, but police did not say how many people were involved.
Anyone with information about the murders can contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper who changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
She announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday, saying: Formerly known as Kanye West.
West, 41, also known as Ye, used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change is expected before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to announce her new album titled Yandy.
She will replace singer Ariana Grande, who will not be appearing on the show due to "sensitivity issues", according to the show's host.
West said that his new name, which was also an abbreviation of his professional name, had religious significance for him.
"Yeah", a word often used in the Bible, meaning "you", West said about the album earlier this year in an interview with his radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am us, we are all us.
It's derived from the first Kan'i, and it means one, so the name Ye is a combination of the good, the bad, the confused, the whole of us.
The album is a reflection of who we are.
He is one of a number of rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, also known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or just Diddy, announced this year that he prefers to be called Love and Love Brothers.
West's colleague, Jay-Z, also changed his name to capitalize it.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has promised that he will not use the military against civilians.
As the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression of students, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use the military against civilians.
Lopez Obrador made a pledge on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would not use the military against civilians.
On October 2, 1968, the military shot and killed about 300 people at a peaceful rally in the plaza, one of the first demonstrations to be seen as a leftist student movement in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to help young Mexicans by offering more free colleges that would pay students for their time in college.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are factors that lead young people to join criminal organizations.
The U.S. needs to double its investment in artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding, says Kai-Fu Li, a developer who has invested in artificial intelligence and has worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
There's been a lot of criticism of AI from all over the U.S. government, including some that say the U.S. has no AI strategy at all.
And yet, China announced last year its plan: to be number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the funding for R&amp;D research would be a good start, given that other countries are a long way from the U.S. in this regard, and we look forward to the next step forward in R&amp;D", Lee said.
Doubling the funding would double the chances of the next big breakthrough in GDP being in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee's book, The Special Powers of AI: China, Silicon Valley, and Building a New World, was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, who is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, and has invested in China's most prominent Face++ company.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on AI systems that would eventually outperform the American Othello, and more recently he was a research executive at Microsoft and president of Google in China.
Lee talked about technology competitions in the past in the U.S. government, like the Defense Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and he asked when the next one would be to determine the next audience.
Researchers in the United States, Lee said, have to work hard to win government grants.
"It's not China that gets the academic leadership, it's the corporations", said Li.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies are hiring university graduates to work in AI.
Changes in immigration policy, Lee said, could also affect U.S. foreign policy efforts.
"I think everyone with a PhD in GIS should get a green card", he said.
The Chinese government announced the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation and other government agencies provide funding to U.S. researchers, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people at academic institutions, but the quality of their academic work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the Department of Defense launched the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which will bring together entrepreneurs and researchers in this field, and the White House announced that it would create a Task Force on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced that it's going to invest two billion dollars in a project called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation has so far funded more than $100 million in AI research.
And yet, the US legislation to create a National Security Committee on Artificial Intelligence has not been implemented for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonian citizens will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia, ending a decade-long dispute with Greece that does not include Macedonia's membership in the European Union or NATO.
Greece, a region called Macedonia, vetoed the possibility of NATO and EU membership, claiming that its northern neighbor was claiming its territory.
The two governments were stuck in a deal on a new name proposed in June, but nationalists say the name change would negatively impact Macedonia's Slavic ethnic identity.
President Georgi Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum, and it is estimated that a boycott of the referendum would be less than the 50% required to make it legal.
The referendum question on the ballot paper was: "Do you agree to NATO and EU membership with Greece's consent?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say Macedonia, one of the newly formed states after the fall of Yugoslavia, opposes joining the EU and NATO because of the name change.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for our new generations in Macedonia, for their opportunities to live in the European Union, because that means a safe life for all of us", said Olivera Georgievskaya, a 79-year-old resident of Skopje.
It's not legally binding, but a lot of members of the parliament voted to approve it and say we're going to make it legal.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in the parliament.
The state election commission reported no illegal activity as of 1 p.m.
Yet, turnout is still only 16 percent -- compared to 34 percent at the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters turned out.
"I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe", said 62-year-old Gyose Tanievski, a voter in the center of Skopje.
In Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko took part in a referendum to change the name of the country to Macedonia, which is expected to pave the way for Macedonia's membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small picket scene to boycott the referendum.
We are not against NATO and the EU, but let's join with our heads up, not through the back door,  said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, then let's join others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership is expected to bring Macedonia the funding it needs, and the unemployment rate is over 20%.
"I think most people will support this proposal because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO", Zaev said after the vote.
He said the "yes" vote would strengthen our future.
A poll conducted last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research found that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would vote in the referendum -- less than the required number.
According to another report by the Macedonian Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents planned to go to the referendum on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote yes.
A successful referendum requires a majority of 50 percent and one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious policy mistake by a pro-Western government that has been in power since May.
Watch: Manchester City Sergio Aguero passes through the defence of Brighton and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defended Brighton to strengthen their 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero scored in the 65th minute, and it seemed too easy.
The Argentine striker started the line in the half and passed.
Three Brighton defenders passed before they fired into the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four players in green shirts.
He passed a defender and ran faster than the others on the edge of the Brighton box.
He then passed to the left and Sterling took over.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to pass it back to Aguero, who beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and hit the ball with his right foot to the right of the goal.
"Aguero has some pain in his leg", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about playing for 55, 60 minutes.
We did.
And that's when the goal was scored.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the number one spot in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep in Brighton.
LeRoy on the left delivers a miraculous shot to Seine.
Shane, who was leading the ball with a small play, passed the pole in the distance.
The Sky Blues scored just before the forward was eliminated.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Thursday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a spoiler game against the Rockies.
There was little reason to worry about being eliminated from the national playoffs and starting over again.
But Scherzer, who is always up for a challenge, is expected to take the lead against the Colorado Rockies on Saturday, but only if it means playoffs for the Rockies, who are one step ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West game.
The Rockies won the National Games 5-2 on Friday and were named the hardest hitters, but they are still fighting for the division title.
We won't change much, but at least we can play well knowing what the supportive atmosphere will be like here in Denver and knowing that the other team will play at the highest level I've ever seen.
Why wouldn't I?
The National League is scheduled to announce a start on Thursday, but Scherzer is rumored to be given a shot at this event.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, will play a bullpen session on Thursday and play normally on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump ' s campaign in West Virginia
The president, in his six months of speaking about how important it was for the Republican Party to win the election, also mentioned the case of Brett Kavanaugh's election to the Supreme Court.
Everything we do is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
It's important, broad -- I'm not running a campaign, but I'm running, so I'm fighting for good candidates everywhere".
"You're looking at a bad, bad bunch of Democrats, and you're looking at what's happening", Trump continued.
They are determined to use whatever means necessary to take back power, corruption, evil.
They don't care who they hurt, they don't care who they crush to gain power and control, and we don't give them what they want, power and control.
Democrats, he said, are about "not giving in, resisting".
"And you see, in the last four days", he said, "he's been calling the Democrats demons, filthy, disgusting, liars".
When he spoke about the Senate Judiciary Committee, he spoke for Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, and the audience was overwhelmingly grateful.
Do you remember the answer?
Did you give the document illegally?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, wait, that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labor Party is no longer the people's church.
He Resists Those Who Have His Own Opinion
It was no surprise when momentum activists in my local party suppressed my speech.
After all, a number of Labour Party members - we all spoke up - made us look bad for the party.
My colleague in the parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she was a strong opponent of anti-Semitism.
In my story, I was criticized by the censorship movement for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe -- topics that Jeremy himself disagreed with his predecessors.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that the meetings were inclusive and fruitful.
When I was a local Labor Party representative for about eight years, this is exactly how the Friday meetings were held.
But today, that's not the nature of many of these gatherings, and the kind, gentle politics that once were, are long forgotten.
It's clear that there is no room for dissent in the Labour Party, and every opinion is being criticized for not being accepted by the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy took over, whether it was national security or the EU's common trade policy, colleagues who had previously shared my views were now expecting me to agree to things I would never agree to.
When I speak to the public, I get a lot of complaints on social media that I'm not fit to be a member of the Labour Party, that I'm not fit to be expelled from the party, that I'm not fit to be a member of the Labour Party.
And that's not my only experience.
And to be honest, I have a better story than some of my colleagues, because my opinions are purely political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who are subjected to racial and sexual abuse every day, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of politics in this era is that it's become normal to speak badly.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party needed to promote a culture of tolerance.
The fact is, we're not a very broad church anymore, and even though every anti-democratic movement or party has changed the rules of election, the party is shrinking.
I've heard a lot of people over the last couple of years tell me to keep your head down, to say nothing, and everything will be okay.
But that is not what I came into politics for.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, and I was so unhappy with the Thatcher government and the classroom at my school that it was completely in decline, I became involved in the cause of improving public services for the disadvantaged, whether as a local government representative or a minister.
I have never kept my politics secret, not even during the last election.
In Nottingham East, no one could say that my political views and disagreements with current leadership were unclear.
And I'm going to say to the people who support this on Friday that I don't see why I should waste my energy and time not trusting the leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading for Brexit and it's affecting families, businesses and public services.
But I will say this with all my heart, not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, to everyone, whether you're a member of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of re-election or political attack will ever distract me from my job.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East.
Air 38  17 Melrose: The defeat of Air above
The last two attempts may have changed the outcome a little bit, but Air certainly deserved a win at tonight's great Tennant Premiere.
Now they're at the top, just the unbeatable side of 10.
Right, they had a good defense, but they took all the chances to help the home side, and Peter Murchie had every right to be grateful.
"We were tested in our games, we are still unbeaten, so I have to be grateful", he said.
Melrose's Robin Christie said, "Hands in the air, they used their chances better than we did".
In the 14th minute, Grant Anderson's shot by Frazier Climo gave Ayr the lead, but Scottish captain Rory Hughes was given a yellow card and dismissed by the Warriors, allowing Melrose to increase the score and Jason Baggott fought the unturned shot.
Climo broke Air's lead with a penalty, and before that, in the halftime, a solo effort that was reversed gave Air a 17-5 lead in the standings.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's shot, driven by Baggott, reduced the score to five points.
Then Ruarid opened up a long wait for a serious injury to Knott, slightly collapsing, and at the start Air was back in front, passing Klimo's Stafford McDowall.
Air Force Captain Blair McPherson got a yellow card, and then again, Melrose scored another no-hitter by Bruce Colvin, almost under pressure.
The home side was back, yes, but Strouin took a yellow card for hanging Hutchison Klimmo without a ball, and McPherson finished with a touchdown in the penalty area behind the leading Air.
Turning the air conditioner around and starting it almost from scratch, Kyle Rowe faced a bounce by David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry home in his fifth attempt.
The Steel Game star seems to have a new career in the restaurant industry.
Word spread that SteelGame star Ford Kieran would continue his hotel career after he was named CEO of the restaurant company.
At the age of 56, Jack Jarvis stars in a popular BBC show, writing the script himself and providing the voice along with his longtime collaborator Greg Hemphill.
The duo recently announced that the upcoming ninth season will be their last, and it's clear that Kieran Craiglan has other plans for her life.
According to his official records, he is the head of a company called Eadriftmorne Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the incident, but a source with the Scottish Press reported that Kiernan was planning to take part in a Glasgow restaurant sale.
The sea is ours: Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes the court will open a path to the Pacific Ocean
The naval headquarters at La Paz is guarded by divers.
The blue flag is flying over public buildings.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are marked with the slogan: "We own the sea".
It is our responsibility to take it back.
Bolivia, surrounded by land, is still reeling from the 19th century war with Chile over a coastline, and so we're still reeling from the desire to go to the Pacific.
The hopes are probably the highest in the past years, because Bolivia is waiting for the verdict of the International Court of Justice, which will finally deliver its verdict on October 1st after five years of regular postponements.
"We believe that Bolivia has a will, with unity and determination, and of course we expect the right result", said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians watched the nationwide television broadcast of the decision of the International Court of Justice, which, after years of negotiations, Chile must grant Bolivia an independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia  is expected to be re-elected next year  Monday will be a crucial day for that too.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised in August.
But some analysts say that the court is not going to side with Bolivia, and even if it does, it will change little.
The United Nations headquarters in the Netherlands said that Chile's territory was not their decision-making power, and that it did not determine the outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice has decided to delay the decision for six months proves that the case is not complicated, said Paz Zarate, a Chilean international law expert.
And then Bolivia didn't get far from its goal, but it probably pushed it back in the last four years.
"The issue of access to the sea is being used by the current Bolivian government", Zarate said.
He suggested that Morales' military promises had destroyed all goodwill left in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile are continuing to negotiate, but it's going to be very difficult.
The two countries have not sent ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected suggestions that the court's decision was faster than usual.
On Monday, he said Bolivia would "open a new era of relations with Chile" and "bring benefits to both countries by ending 139 years of hostility".
Calzadilla da Morales still disagrees with the idea that the most famous president of Latin America is using the sea question as a political game.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The court decision a chance to see what we can learn from the past.
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not happen until they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that if the nation does not trust Washington, it will never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
The leaders of the two rival countries urged the United States to honor the promises made in Singapore.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the remarks as he was about to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy after a meeting between North Korea and Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri called the US's continued sanctions and refusal to end the Korean War a "dream that did not bring the North to its knees".
Washington is reluctant to sign the declaration until Pyongyang takes serious disarmament steps.
Kim and US President Donald Trump are about to hold their second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang really wants to give up its weapons, and it seems to see its arsenal as its only security.
Pompeo is coming to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Show has unveiled the latest line of headwear that will soon be coming to your street
If you want to add new hats to your collection or hide from the sun completely, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne announced a large, diverse line of headwear for their summer 2019 collections in a stylish fashion show at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, these seamless headscarves filled Instagram, and these designers sent out their stunning creations to showcase.
The most striking outfit Valentino ever made was a large, gray, bird-like hat that was placed on the front of the models.
Other great accessories included jewel-encrusted necklaces, a bow hat, and even pineapples, but these didn't keep you warm.
Thom Browne also published a list of weird Halloween masks.
Most of the masks were in different colors, with a lid, and the fire was more like Hannibal Lecter than a fashion couture.
One helmet was a scuba diver with a pair of glasses and a breathing tube, and the other was a frozen ice cream cone.
If you want to be a fashion star, you can.
Fashion experts expect that soon, hats will be on the streets near you.
The two-pound straw hat, La Bomba, was worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski, and it was followed by the larger-sized hats.
Following this trend in social media, a new product has been launched: a large straw beach bag that models can wear to the size of a straw.
A bright purple bag with a white belt on the handle was the highlight of the Jacques La Rivière SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, "I expect big hats and beach bags to hit the streets next summer.  The designer influence is so strong that it's hard not to notice the demand for big accessories".
John Edward: Language is vital for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland are performing academically well, and they're continuing to do so in 2018. Another outstanding test of schools is further encouraged by their individual and community success in sports, industry and community activities.
With some 30,000 students in Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the highest quality of services to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, for the careers of their choice, and for their place as citizens of the universe.
As an education sector that has a designated school curriculum, we see that learning languages today is still a required subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language they understand, you stay in their head.
If you talk to a person in their language, it will stay in their heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot communicate with people from other countries using English alone.
And the most recent test this year showed that the students who took language classes in independent schools scored the highest.
68 percent of students who studied a foreign language got an A.
Data collected from 74 schools in the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students in Chinese, 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish received A's.
This data shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages, which will be very important for children and young people in the future.
Languages are still as important as STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) in private schools or anywhere else.
In a 2014 survey by the Employment Services Board in England, 17 percent of people were asked what their reason for not getting a job was, "I don't speak the language".
Thus, the need to learn a language is growing as a means of preparing young people for future careers.
In a globalized world, learning another language can open up more employment opportunities.
Whatever career they choose, they will have a lifelong advantage over others if they learn a foreign language.
A person who knows many languages can quickly gain a competitive advantage by being able to communicate directly with foreign visitors.
A YouGov survey of 4,000 people in England found that 75 percent did not speak a foreign language to communicate, and the only top 15 percent spoke French.
So it is vital that children have resources for language learning.
Knowing more than one language, especially in developed lands, can help children to find better employment.
In Scotland, schools differ in the language they teach.
While some schools may choose to teach classical modern languages, others may teach languages that are expected to be important in England in 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Because independent schools can choose from a variety of languages, whatever your child is interested in, and their teachers are experts in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing students with the highest quality education to prepare them for diverse futures and to succeed.
And in this time, of course, in this globalized business environment, languages will continue to be important to the future of a country, and education needs to reflect that.
In fact, knowing modern languages is an art of international communication.
Independent schools will continue to offer these conditions, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It is good to do.
John Edward  Chairman of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron makes his first appearance with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego .
Fans were eager to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton James announced that he will play the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But how long it will last has yet to be decided.
"It's more than one, but it's less than 48 minutes", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers secretary Mike Trudell tweeted that James appears to have a limited playing time.
After this week's practice, James was asked about his Lakers' plans for six preseason games.
"I don't need pre-season games to be ready at my current career level", he said.
Trump's West Virginia Campaign, the YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin his campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight.
This is the first of five Trump's campaign listings scheduled for next week, including stops in the favored states of Tennessee and Mississippi.
The vote on the Supreme Court nomination was postponed, as Trump hopes to build support for the November midterm elections, as the Republicans may lose their majority in Congress.
What time is Trump's West Virginia campaign today and how can you watch it online?
Trump's campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is set for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia campaign live on YouTube now.
Trump may also be talking about a Supreme Court hearing this week on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, which was postponed for a week pending an FBI investigation into the rape allegations.
But the primary goal of these campaigns is to help give the Republican Party a little bit of leverage in the November election.
The Trump campaign is giving a boost to volunteers and supporters who plan to run five campaigns next week, while the Republican Party is trying to expand its majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, reports Reuters.
"The majority of Congress is a very important thing for the president, so he's going to travel as many states as possible, and we're in for a very tough season", said Trump's campaign secretary, who declined to be identified to Reuters.
Today's campaign at the Wesleyan Arena in Wheeling could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the attention of the news in Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday marked Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the past month, a state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percent of the vote.
Trump is trying to help his Republican candidate for the Senate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, who is a little behind.
"The president's visit to help is not a good sign for Morrissey", said Simon Heather, a scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA prepares for Sunday and says they will fight hard
After a three-way session, a two-two golf game on Saturday might be just what the Ryder Cup needs.
The power that players move between themselves is a fantasy in sports, but it is real and even more so in these matches.
Who has the power now?
"They were six points ahead, but now we're four points ahead, so we're a little bit strong", Jordan Speight said at the start of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course, with 12 games left, and they're four points ahead.
Americans, says Speight, think they have a small knife, for many reasons, like Speight and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, scored three-quarters each.
Spieth was a great example of playing hard to get.
When it was his turn, the ceremonial procession continued, with the tribe of the goat reaching the four corners, and he and Thomas falling two by two.
The 15th-inning game ended in a big applause, and he said the Americans still had a chance.
"If it works, you have to dig deep and think about your match", said Spieth.
All of these players have just quit.
There are 18 holes to score.
The players with the most points than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup champions.
Europe's interesting but popular players are four out of four, and they can't make mistakes.
They were the only place in Hollywood that didn't shoot any shots on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided shooting one shot on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning.
That run and the energy that flowed back and forth from them all made it clear that they were going to be tough on Sunday, and it was clear that either Fleetwood or Molinari were the only big players with a chance to win at sunset over Le Golf National.
Both are in the same hole at the same time.
It's too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson played the short roles of Sergio Garcia and Alec Noren in the morning four.
The Spaniard and the Swede were in the top nine in singles and doubles, and they never got out of the hole.
On Sundays, no one helps you out of the hole.
Four balls and two by two is great to watch golf because people in the same team can change their play and their tips and strategies in an instant.
Europe as a team has been better, and they made a significant improvement on the last day, but those doubters that the U.S. could play well in this two-two game have been dismissed, especially the Stateside doubters.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup 10-6 on the final day
On the final day of the European Ryder Cup, the United States had a 10-6 lead in the four-team and two-team field on Saturday.
The powerful duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari beat the struggling Tiger Woods by two points to take the lead, their best result at La Golf Nacional by four points.
Thomas Bjorn, on the European side, had a chance to win back the prey he had lost two years earlier at Hazeltine, and he beat the American side hard in the opening four rounds, ending the game 3-1.
In the two-on-two golf, the U.S. offered to play more, won two games, but couldn't lose.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from 12 singles games on Sunday to keep them from being a target.
Fleetwood became the first European to win four straight games, and the Molinari-led "Mollywoods" became the second couple in Ryder Cup history to win four in their first four games.
Woods and Patrick Reed were defeated in four sets, with Woods and American player Bryson Deschambe losing 5-4.
Woods, who barely played two games on Saturday, was a good player at times, but he's now lost seven of his 29 consecutive games by four goals to two in golf.
Justin Rose, with a break in the morning four, returned to the lead of Henrik Stenson and defeated world number one and third Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2-1
Europe didn't win the war as they wanted, but it was a cool, pleasant day south of Paris.
The three-time major winners, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, set a tough example for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They beat John Ram and Jan Polter of Spain 2-1 and beat younger Paulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 to come back, but lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team lost a single game by four points, even though Fury's side had to make a small effort to win.
But after two days of being the second best, Sunday's counterattack is expected to be more difficult.
North Korea says it will not disarm "completely" a country that lacks confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions were deepening mistrust in the United States and that the country would never hand over nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken significant steps last year, such as suspending nuclear and military tests, closing the nuclear test site, and pledging not to develop nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we have not received a decent response from the United States", he said.
Without trust in the United States, there can never be trust in national security, and disarmament is not possible for us in this environment.
While Ri reiterated his earlier arguments that Washington opposed North Korea's gradual denuclearization, his words proved important because Pyongyang did not refuse to unilaterally denuclearize as it had done in the past.
Ri Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump echoed a joint statement at their first summit as presidents, and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, Kim said he would aim for disarmament on the Korean Peninsula, and Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea was officially seeking a deadline to end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also been slow to lift tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US is demanding a forced disarmament first to achieve its goal and increasing pressure with sanctions and refusing to declare an end to the war", Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can affect us is a pipe dream of nations that know nothing about us.
The problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust.
Ri didn't talk about his plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which Trump did at the United Nations a week ago.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, and added: "If South Korea and the United States had not been the solution to this disarmament issue, disarmament on the Korean Peninsula would not have fallen into this unresolved abyss".
But Ri's speech was very different from what he said at the UN last year, "Mr. Bad President" and "Trump called Kim a Killer Missile Man" and North Korea was supposed to be destroyed by the General Assembly for trying to launch a missile at the United States.
At the United Nations this year, Trump threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his progress toward disarmament, but said there was still much work to be done, and that sanctions should remain in place until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have time for this, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months".
China and Russia have discussed the UN and the Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "Ensuring compliance with the Security Council's sanctions must continue vigorously and uninterruptedly until we achieve complete, final and verifiable disarmament".
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea beginning in 2006 in an effort to stop Pyongyang's funding of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly and finally informed him that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a good one.
He left Pyongyang in July with a success story for North Korea alone, within an hour of testing his gangster claims".
North Korea promised to dismantle the missile facility and the nuclear complex if the United States took the necessary measures".
He said Kim was looking for the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the willingness to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on getting enough rest
This year, a new course has forced all Harvard high school seniors to sleep a lot as a way to combat the culture of caffeinated, overnight self-loathing.
The number one university in the academic world discovered that students are not educated about how to provide basic care for themselves.
Charles Chase, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a fellow at the Women's and Bryan Hospitals, believes that he has developed the best independent course in the United States.
After giving a talk on the effects of sleep deprivation on reading, she was inspired to start the course.
'Finally, one girl came to me and said, 'Why did I learn about this only now, in my last year of high school?
He said that no one had ever told me about the importance of sleep - I was surprised".
This year's first course, a sleep routine, taught students how good sleep habits can help them study and exercise and improve their overall mood.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, told me that he decided to take the course after learning that students had been up all week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive assignments.
One section shows a picture of a dorm where students are asked to choose coffee mugs, curtains, trainers, books, and how sports affect sleep deprivation and how sleep is important.
In another study, participants were told that prolonged lack of sleep may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The interactive signs and a map of the campus make participants think about their daily lives.
'We know that students' behavior does not change overnight.
But we believe that they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the harmful effects of smoking", adds Professor Chase.
"There is still a culture that prides itself on working all night", he adds, "and it's a sign of growing sleep deprivation because of the ever-increasing technology and pressure on students".
He said that adequate and quality sleep should be the secret tool for students to deal with stress, weight loss, anxiety -- and to keep from gaining weight, because sleep deprivation sets your brain into starvation mode, and you're hungry all night.
Raymond Seo, a 19-year-old chemistry and physiology student in California, helped Professor Chase develop the course last year by recruiting one of his classmates during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this course was an eye opener for him and inspired the entire campus to teach this course.
The next step, he hopes, will be to invite all graduates to complete a similar program before joining a competing institution.
Professor Chase suggested that students set an alarm clock to measure bedtime and waketime, taking into account the harmful effects of blue light from LED displays and electronic screens, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm by causing poor sleep.
I got a shot at Gerrard 's man .
On the road, the Rangers suffered another knockout, with Dolly Mangi's shot going to the crazy Stephen Gerrard, and they lost to Livingston 1-0.
The Ibrox side were hoping to win their first game since their 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team Ladbrokes Hearts scored a second goal for Gerrardo as manager in Game 18 to give the Premier League leaders in the streak 8 points to their side.
I couldn't believe that the Rangers were tied with seven minutes to go.
At the time, Rangers were sixth, and Livingston were only one goal behind Hibernian, and were relegated to third.
The Rangers had another problem, when an object from a distance touched Abritter Callum Spence's head, and he had to be treated for his head.
Gerrard made eight substitutions for Ayr, who were coming up short in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was a Livi 11 who scored points last week for the same Hearts, and he was excited that his well-trained team was outsmarting his opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated the field, but Livingston dominated as much as he could.
They were about to score two minutes into Menga's first play-off, and they were sent to Scott Pittman through McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the convenient moment.
A strong penalty by Keegan Jacobs found team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only kicked him into the back of the net.
The Rangers took two strikes, one tie, but in the final third, they were more hopeful than confident.
Alfredo Morelos and Steven Lawless clashed, but when referee Stephen Thomson dropped the Colombian's appeal, he felt that Morelos should have had a penalty in the quarter.
The Rangers scored just two runs in the first half, with former Ibrox keeper Liam Kelly's Lassan Kulibally's head and Ovie's shot off the ball.
Levi's goal in the 34th minute could have been the game changer, because they were bribed.
Once again, the Rangers failed to match Jacobs' set.
Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was trying to catch Manga for a simple finish, but Scott Arfield did not react to the attempts.
Replacing the curling ball with Ryan Kent, Gerrard tried to hit the ball, and the replacement made an immediate impact, as the forward collided with Morelos, but Kelly, who was blocking his line, was surprised and ran.
But Livingston, Lithgow, and Hallett cleared the ball and brought the visitors to their favorite game.
In the final stages, Holt's side could have taken the lead, but McGregor held a good position to block Jacobs before Lithgow hit the ball with his head from a wide angle.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton demanded another late penalty, and he fought Jacobs, but Thompson still turned around.
The Almanac Collection: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday morning almanac: 136 years ago today, September 30, 1982... today in Germany, the future physicist Johann Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which led to the invention of the Geiger counter, which became known as the final result.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become a staple of pop culture, as have the unlikely science cowboy Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the 1950s film The Bell Jar:
Man: Where did this come from?
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter, which is used to measure radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear an earpiece, you can hear the effects of atoms in the radioactive material".
Evans: "He's about to shoot, just tell me!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can induce the immune system to " envy " foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine triggers the immune system to detect and kill foreign cells
As part of the treatment, the vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells
This method involves removing immune cells from a patient, re-engineering them in the lab.
They can see a protein that looks like many types of cancer.
The vaccine then undergoes a re-test, which gives patients the long-awaited results of a treatment for a number of cancers.
A woman who received a vaccine that trains her immune system to recognize foreign cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear in just over 18 months.
The technique involves removing the patient's immune cells, identifying a protein called HER2 that is similar to many types of cancer, modifying it in the laboratory, and then putting the cells back into the patient.
Jay Berzowski, a professor at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results confirm that we have the most promising vaccine".
"HER2 is involved in the regulation of many cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, and bowel cancer", explains Professor Berzowski.
This approach, like taking immune cells from patients and then training them, has been shown to target cancer cells and to work in treating some types of leukemia.
Kanye West, after his speech on SNL on Friday night, wore a MAGA hat to defend his outrageous speech against Trump.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West, during a live broadcast on Saturday Night Live, heard only unrelated whispers of disapproval for his speech praising the United States, when President Donald Trump announced that he would run for president again in 2020.
Kanye West wore a hat that said "Make America Great" and sang his third song, "Ghost Town", challenging the Democrats and voicing his support for Trump.
"I've had many conversations with white people, and they keep asking me, 'What do you like about Trump?
If racism was something that bothered me, I would have left America".
The channel started the SNL show with a parody of Matt Damon, who mocked the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the sexual abuse of Hollywood star Matt Damon by Kristen Blaze Ford.
Whether or not this is an audio, a video of Kanye West speaking was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Chris Rock's posting of the video was intended as a joke.
West also complained to the audience that he had heard bad language because he was wearing a hat on the outside of the screen.
"They beat me and did not give me peace.
They told me never to go on stage in this hat".
They laughed at me!
"I was told that I was going to die", says a reporter from the United States.
West went on: "Do you want to see where it's going to sink?" "I'm going to wear my Superman mask, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Then try it".
His remarks were followed by at least two outbursts of public outcry. The staff of Saturday Night Live were at a loss for words.
West was invited to replace Ariana Grande, who was unable to attend because of Grande's ex-boyfriend Mac Miller's death a few days earlier.
West surprised many by wearing a Perrier bottle on the song "I Like It".
West got a hand from conservative TPUSA member Candice Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest: Thank you for standing up to the mob".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that "West just happened to be who he was, and it's amazing!"
"However, I decided not to reward anyone who supported an ideology that was harmful to my community (by buying their music, or their clothes, or their art).
He is a free man.
He was a free man, just like the rest of us.
At the beginning of the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name from "Kanye West" to "Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his nickname, and also performs under the aliases Puff Daddy, Puffy, P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, changed his stage name to Snoop Lion, and the legendary music legend Prince changed his stage name to a symbol, and then back to the artist known as Prince.
Accused of assaulting a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man pleaded guilty to stabbing a man in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The police were notified that the incident had taken place in Ballyhacamore.
He is expected to appear in court Monday in Belfast.
The prosecution will decide on the charges.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington is a man of many talents
Keith Harrington is best known for his role as swordsman John Snow in the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor says that the stereotypes about macho men often make younger children see such roles on screen and believe that they must be tough to be respected.
Keith spoke to The Sunday Times Culture about how he believes something went wrong and how to address the overblown problem of masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his co-star, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he felt strong enough to handle this extreme issue of heroism.
He said that now, personally, I feel pretty sharp about where we've misplaced courage.
In view of the issue at hand, what is the point of not raising children?
Keith believes that television may also be responsible for the rise of overly masculine characters and overly aggressive heroes.
He goes on: "What is natural here, and what is taken from outside?
What do television and the streets teach children to see themselves as a certain type of man?
I think the single most important problem we have right now is how do we fix this problem?
Because there's something really, really wrong with young children.
In an interview, she also announced that she would no longer be working on a prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the series ended in the summer. She announced that she had stopped fighting and horses.
From November, Keith will star in Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a film producer and his thief brother.
He said that meeting his wife Rose at a game of cards was the best part of his time on the show.
"I met my wife on the show, and my future family and life were born on it".
In the Emmy-winning science fiction series, Rose Keith played the role of John Snow's lover, Igrit.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% of new cases.
China reported a 14% increase in the number of people diagnosed with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials estimate that more than 820,000 people in the country have these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, there were about 40,000 new cases.
Most of them are sexually transmitted, which shows a change in statistics from last year.
In some parts of China, HIV has spread rapidly through transfusions of infected blood.
Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan that this has reduced the number of new HIV infections to almost zero.
Yet, the number of new HIV and AIDS cases in China has increased by 100,000 each year.
Sexually transmitted AIDS is a major problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but there is still reported discrimination against LGBT people.
Because of the country's outdated values, studies show that 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many sexually transmitted diseases are the result of misconceptions about sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to make HIV drugs available to everyone as part of its efforts to address these problems.
Maxine Waters denied the "conspiracy theories" and "dangerous false information" leaks by Republican senators.
On Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters accused a staff member of posting the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia.
A Democrat from Los Angeles said the complaints were made by a radical opposition official and website.
"Lies, lies, and even more hateful lies", Waters tweeted.
The leaked data lists the phone numbers and home addresses of three U.S. Senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
An anonymous source posted a story on Capitol Hill on Thursday during a sexual assault hearing against Senate Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
It was only after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh that the leak occurred.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have published the information of a Waters employee that links the IP address to the source of the messages, reports The Hill.
"This unverified statement is completely false and utterly false", Waters continued.
"My staff members whose identity, privacy, and security are compromised by fraud and false credentials cannot be held responsible for leaks of information that could damage their reputation.
This unverified account is completely false and utterly false".
Waters's statement was quickly criticized online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is angry cancellation", wrote Fleischer.
"It's a sign that he doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When judging someone for something he did not do, he should not be easily angered.
They should not be rude.
They should not allow the accusers to become suspicious of their motives.
They need to be calm and peaceful".
Fleischer seems to have compared Waters's reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who appeared to be very angry during the hearing on Thursday.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who was also voting for his party's nomination in the midterm elections, tweeted his thoughts.
"Great, if this is true", he tweeted.
In her complaint, Waters' office warned law enforcement agencies and authorities about the fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the culprits are exposed", he continued, "and that they are held accountable for their actions, which are dangerous and reprehensible to all members of my staff".
Johnny Enlightening Strikes Again - Not So Strong is a spy novel by Rowan Atkinson
Now we're going to see the new British film that wants to understand Brexit, and that's a re-release of the Johnny Ennis action-comedy franchise, which started in 2003 and then came back to theaters in 2011 with the re-imagining of Johnny Ennis.
Could self-deprecating satire be a new export opportunity for the country?
At any given moment, Johnny Ennis will return for a second time with his big, rubber-eyed face, and the name of the actor who plays Johnny Ennis means that this will signal the best comedy and the most entertaining film in the territory of a non-English speaking audience.
He's a dumb undercover agent, of course, but despite his ridiculous demands for glamorous smoothies, he took a little Clouseau, took on the character of Mr. Bean, and brought a single note to the thirty-third London Opera in 2012.
He also starred in the now-forgotten TV show Barlycard, which was based on the international mystery writer and traveller Atkinson, who left a mess in his wake.
There were one or two good moments on the last Johnny Ennis tour.
I loved the way Johnny Enlightenment wore a medieval coat and whistled from the helicopter's fender to his head as he approached the helicopter.
Atkinson's gift is often portrayed as a physical comedy, but humor is often seen as lacking and excessive, especially in the major film brands like 007 and Mission: Impossible, which now credibly promote comedy as an ingredient.
I think the humor is more for young children than adults, and Johnny Ennis's bad stories are not as good as Atkinson's Bob the Deaf.
The United Kingdom is in a real crisis right now.
By exposing the identities of all the British agents in the area, the hacker had gained access to a highly classified British network and struck a nerve with the agent on duty, an unfortunate minor role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for a haughty, controversial figure who has lost her political profile and suffered a complete defeat: this quasi-Theresa May, Emma Thompson, who does everything possible, but nothing special in the script.
His intelligence advisers knew that every active spy was a bad name, so he had to send someone to resign.
And Johnny Enlish says that he's a high school teacher at some really cool institution, but he's teaching informal classes on how to be a secret agent: a good joke, like Enlish's rock-oriented proposal of a spy academy.
Ennis returns to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and is joined by her former patient husband, Ben Miller, who reprises his role as Boff.
Boff, who was married to the captain of a submarine called the "Jolly-Hockey-Hump", played Vicky Pepperdine, who was a bit of a failure.
After a major mistake in the Secret Service, Batman and Robin get back together, until they meet the powerful Olga Kurylenko  Ofelia Bulatova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is under the dangerous influence of a charismatic British billionaire who can solve computer puzzles.
Ennis and Boff begin their odyssey with a series of heartless jokes: dressed as waitresses, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos aboard Volta's luxurious yacht; and Ennis tries to use a virtual headset to explore the interior of Volta's home, creating pure anarchy.
All the effort was made, of course, for the final episode, but as exciting and loud as it is, there is enough children's TV in all of them.
Enough stopping staff.
And as with all of Johnny Ennis' other films, I couldn't help but wonder: Why couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that was right for his talent?
Labour has denied that they are working on a plan to pay five days a week for the British.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party should come up with a radical plan where the British work four days a week and get paid for five.
It turns out that the party wants the CEOs of companies to give the employees the deposit they've made from the AI revolution, with an extra day off.
It is as if the workers enjoyed three days of rest but went home with the same wage.
Sources say the idea is on the party's economic agenda and the plan is to shift the country in favor of the workers.
The shift to a four-day workweek was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the benefits of a changing economy.
The leading Labour Party newspaper The Sunday Times reported: 'A policy review is expected before the end of the year.
It won't be in an hour, but a four-day workweek  it's a commitment to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the worker, embodied in the party's approach to it and the party's overall industrial strategy".
The Labor Party was not the first to support this idea, and the Green Party announced a four-day workweek during its 2017 election campaign.
But today, the Labour Party as a whole is not in favour of this.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day workweek is not the policy of the party and was not intended by the party".
Chancellor of the Exchequer John MacDonnell used a Labour conference last week to articulate his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the unusual directors and speculators in utilities.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer's plans also explain why current shareholders of these companies may not be able to recover all their shares, because the Labour government may be forced to dissolve on the basis of suspected irregularities.
He also approved plans to include workers in company boards of directors and to create inclusive private equity funds to give employees 10% of private company shares that could receive dividends of up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham, John F. Kennedy, and 60 Minutes talk about whether the FBI investigation will change Kavanaugh's mind.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) investigation into the indictment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh is over, and the Supreme Court vote on her nomination has been postponed for at least a week, raising questions about whether the FBI's findings will influence Republican senators to support them.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley of 60 Minutes asked Republicans John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI had found something that would have forced them to change their minds.
Kennedy, from South Carolina, was much more open than his counterpart.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
"I told them I was going to the trial, and I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
And I called him after it happened and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, decisive".
Graham's voice sounds like it's carved into stone.
"I've made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and it's a dynamite charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett was a resounding denial", Graham added, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
"At least those who know it can't say it is.
He is 36 years old.
I saw nothing new".
What is the Global Citizens' Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York is the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive lineup of stars and also has an impressive mission: to end world poverty.
This seventh annual Global Citizens Festival brought about 10,000 people to Central Park, not just to party with the big names like Janet Jackson and Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but to hear about the real purpose of the festival - to end world poverty by 2030.
The 2012 Global Citizen Festival is a continuation of the Global Citizen Festival to Fight Poverty, which was launched by an international advocacy group to help end poverty by increasing the number of active citizens.
To get a free ticket (if you're not willing to buy a VIP ticket), the concertgoers must complete a series of tasks that show their awareness of ending poverty, or volunteer, email a world leader, make a phone call, or any other important method.
But 12 years before the goal, how successful is the Global Citizens' Festival?
Is giving out free concert tickets a call to action to fight real poverty, or is it just another example of click activism - do people really feel like they're making a difference by just posting a petition online or tweeting?
Since 2011, the Global Citizens' Festival has inspired more than 19 million supporters to take action.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to promote more than $37 billion worth of commitments and policies that should affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group cited at least $10 billion already paid or withdrawn, including 390 liabilities and claims arising from its activities.
The health care system has now directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key initiatives include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and executives who support the full growth of Jennernani by pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition after more than 4,700 tweets from around the world.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens, we can turn social injustice into a first-ever success story", said Tracy Ullman, Power of Nutrition ambassador, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 initiatives to improve maternal and child nutrition in the UK, the government announced funding for the Food Power initiative, which will involve nearly 5 million women and children through nutrition initiatives.
He answers one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
 global citizen responded, "It's going to be a long and difficult road.
But just as strong as the great civil rights movements before us, we can succeed because we are strong together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are all going to be the keynote speakers at this year's event in New York City hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
"The US Navy could use Russian exports of energy carriers to export", the interior minister said.
Washington may rely on the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including the Middle East, according to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, reports the Washington Examiner.
Zinké argues that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially where it is working at the behest of its legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"The reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to trade energy in Eastern Europe, like they do in Southern Europe", he said.
And the official said that there are ways and methods to solve this problem.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to keep the sea lanes open and blockade them to ensure that energy doesn't go to the market if necessary".
Zinke addressed the audience at an event organized by the Consumers Energy Alliance, which describes itself as the voice of the energy consumer in the United States.
He said that Washington's approach to Russia and Iran is equally effective.
He said, "The economic choice for Iran and Russia is to use and replace more and more of that fuel", and he said that Russia is a country whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels and has no other resources.
The announcement comes as the Trump administration is working to export liquefied natural gas to Europe and provide cheaper energy to European consumers instead of Russia.
To achieve this, officials in the Trump administration, as well as US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says is holding Berlin prisoner by Moscow.
Several times in Moscow, the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline has been described as a purely economic project, increasing the pipeline's current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters.
The Kremlin says that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is economic and an example of unfair competition.
"We believe that energy should not be a tool of pressure and that consumers should have the freedom to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
Germany, which had expressed support for the project, reacted negatively to the U.S. position.
The leading German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), urged the United States to stay out of the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
After the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Dieter Kempf, head of the German Confederation of Industry (BDI), said, "I am very concerned about the interference of a third country in our energy supply".
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts says she's going to run for president in 2020 and will be very prepared to fight.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said that she would be very keen to run for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren said that he would consider running.
"It's time for women, including this woman, to go to Washington and fix our broken government", she said, quoted by The Hill.
"After November 6, I will be actively preparing to run for office".
During a regional summit, Warren said that President Donald Trump was "leading the region in the wrong direction".
"I am genuinely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted that "the FBI must verify this before they can vote".
But a poll released Thursday showed that Warren's voters believe he should not run in 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Center for Policy Research/Boston Global Voting, "possible" Massachusetts voters say the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported his participation.
The poll showed that voters favored former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 percent voted for him, 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democrats were also mentioned in the 2020 election debate, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
According to the Associated Press, Biden will officially announce his decision in January.
At a rally for Donald Trump, Sarah Palin spoke about her PTSD.
26-year-old Trek Palin joined the army in September and spent a year in Iraq.
She was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"I can tell you what my son has not been through, the hardships he has had since he came back, the post-traumatic stress of other families who have suffered from trauma and the soldiers who have come back injured", she told a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, against Donald Trump.
Palin described his son's imprisonment as a major problem and shared her thoughts about her son and other veterans, who "come back a little different, they come back stronger, and they wonder if fellow soldiers, pilots and every member of the military will be appreciated for what they do for their country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic assault, based on a report by Dan Bennett, a police spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, that he was a drunk and used a firearm in domestic violence.
18 states and the District of Columbia have endorsed the call for new asylum policies.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have backed a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that prohibits granting asylum to victims of domestic violence and refugees.
According to NBC News, on Friday, in Washington, D.C., representatives from 18 states and counties wrote a letter in support of asylum seekers as "counsel to the court".
The plaintiff, whose full name is Grace W. Sessions, is suing the American Civil Liberties Union for unsealed federal policy complaint filed in August.
She was abused by her boyfriend and "her violent gangster children", but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers for Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which had the highest number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries with high rates of gang violence and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy overturned a 2014 Immigration Appeals Board decision that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum to escape domestic violence.
Attorney General Carl R. R. Sippe of the District of Columbia said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of federal, state and international legislation".
"Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be made on the basis of clear facts or circumstances, and this prohibition violates that principle",  stated the statement, "as counsel for the court".
Lawyers say that immigration bans are hurting the U.S. economy because immigrants often run businesses or "provide the labor force they need".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued an order to immigration courts that they no longer provide shelter to victims of domestic violence or gang violence.
"A country can offer asylum to people who have been discriminated against on the basis of race, religion, national identity, or persecution because of their membership in a social group or political opinion", Sessions said in a policy announcement on July 11.
Shelters are not designed to solve all problems, or even all the big problems that people around the world face in their daily lives.
In the rescue effort in Palu , the number of deaths during the search for survivors doubled
The situation became increasingly dangerous for the survivors.
"It's a terrible situation", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her crumbling child in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, the ambulance was bringing bodies.
Clean water is scarce".
Residents returned to their destroyed homes, searching for their submerged belongings and trying to save at least some of them.
Hundreds were injured, and hospitals were completely overwhelmed by the devastating 7.5-magnitude quake.
Some of the wounded, including Dwyane Harris, who had a broken back and shoulder, were in the Pallu Army Hospital, where patients were overcrowded, many lying in the open air.
When he remembered that the earthquake had struck in his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was staying with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I'm trapped between walls that have fallen", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that her family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry out for help, and then she calmed down.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they are safe".
US official accuses China of "propaganda"
After the official Chinese newspaper in the US published a four-page weekly ad about the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in Beijing accused China of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Following accusations that the United States is interfering in the November 6 congressional elections (which China denies), President Donald Trump last week cited a paid supplement by the China Daily Register in De Moine, Iowa, the largest newspaper company in the state.
The accusation of Beijing interfering in the US election, as US officials told Reuters, means a new phase of US pressure on China.
While promoting other countries is commonplace, Beijing and Washington are in a position to end a trade war and impose the same tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and American experts say that China's new tariffs, which were introduced at the beginning of the trade war, were aimed at hurting states like Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party.
The U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of the largest agricultural exporters to China, Terry Branstad, said Beijing had done great harm to American workers, farmers, and businesses.
In the Sunday newspaper De Moine, Branstad said China was "doubling this ridicule by advertising in our own free newspaper".
"By paying De Moine for advertising, China is using the free speech and free press traditions that America craves to promote its propaganda", wrote Branstad.
"But here in Beijing, there are very few people who think differently, and you don't see the contradictions that reflect the real Chinese view of China's peaceful economic direction, because the media are controlled by the Chinese Communist Party".
He added that his article was "One of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish" , without specifying which newspaper.
After Kavanaugh's fall, Republicans have been pushing women out of the race, analysts warn.
Analysts warn that despite several reports of sexual assault, many Republicans are staying out and supporting Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotion was so strong that many Republicans said they wanted to continue voting.
These events cannot be undone", says Grant Richer, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in a Saturday article in The Hill.
Senator Jeff Flay of Arizona was convinced at the last minute that the FBI and the investigation were not enough to drive voters crazy.
"Women are not ready to forget what happened yesterday, not tomorrow, not in November", said Karin Jean-Pierre, general counsel and national representative of the progressive group MoveOn, quoted by the Washington Post in the District of Columbia on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming", and Mic reported that members of the Republican Party, which controls the Judiciary Committee, sang the same song in the Senate hallways when they wanted to go forward by supporting Kavanaugh, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's advice.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are growing beyond the normal range", says political scientist Stu Rothenberg, who is not a member of any political party, on a news website.
"People say it was already higher, and it's true.
But it's probably even higher, especially among women voters in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who don't usually vote even if they don't like the president".
Before Ford was publicly accused of sexual assault by a Supreme Court nominee, analysts speculated that the Republicans might have a counter-argument if they could provide evidence.
According to NBC News, earlier this week, Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said, "This has been a messy and confusing affair for the Republican Party".
"It's not just about the vote or the final vote or the impeachment of Kavanaugh, it's about how the Republicans are handling it and how they're responding", said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps the Democrats win the election.
Yet, the American people are divided over who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, and Kavanaugh is a little over halfway there.
According to a new YouGov poll, 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony is either true or approximate, and 35 percent believe Kavanaugh is true or approximate.
Meanwhile, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh had either roughly or explicitly lied in his testimony, while another 30 percent said that Ford had.
After Flake's attack, the FBI is currently investigating the death of Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh was drunk and assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez said that the Supreme Court nominee was a student at Yale University in the 1980s and showed her genitals at a party.
The man who invented the World Wide Web is going to create a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is about to start a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project by a tech legend, Inrupt, is a company built on the Berners-Lee Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their appointments are stored and which people can access which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt is "global dominance".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid technology to help people create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It contains a list of contacts, a to-do list, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all coming together in one browser.
The uniqueness of a private online store is that it is completely dependent on the user who can access the data.
The company calls this "empowerment of the individual through the believer".
According to CEO John Bruce, the main goal of Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes, and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, and a few staff programmers and a group of volunteer programmers who have been contracted to work on the project.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to build their own decentralized apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team "did not talk to Facebook and Google about introducing something that would instantly change their business models.
"We didn't ask them for permission".
In a statement posted on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission  is to provide commercial power and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at MIT.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even after he started Inrupt, Berners-Lee remained the co-founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next era of the Internet", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann , minister of the Holy Victoria Cross during World War I
The only pope of the Church of England to have fought in World War I and won the Victoria Cross, was the first time in 100 years that his city had celebrated the event.
Honorable Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was decorated for the attack on Bellenglish and Leuchur on September 29, 1918.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, unaware that he had been awarded Britain's highest military honor.
A memorial plaque was presented to the two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that the discovery of the stone, exactly 100 years after his grandfather was honored, made it a "true symbol".
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal du Saint-Cant "in thick fog and a rainstorm of field guns and machine guns".
Then he went up against the arrows, led his men forward with "great bravery", and with one hand he threw his field weapon and destroyed three bands.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, about a month before the battle.
Michael Vann, 72, said of his grandfather's actions, "I could never have done this, and I was ashamed".
She and her uncle, Dr. James Vann, laid flowers after a parade led by the Imperial Brentwood Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann added: "It was an honor to be part of the parade" and "the fact that so many people supported my grandfather is proof that he was a real hero".
MMA fans stayed up all night waiting for Bellator 206 but instead saw the animated movie Peppa Pig.
Imagine staying up all night to watch Bellator 206 but this long-awaited event is not airing.
The San Jose match featured 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was broadcast live on Channel 5 in the UK throughout the night.
At 6 a.m., Gegard Moussaoui and Rory McDonald were preparing to face off, when the British audience was surprised to see Peppa Pig on the screen.
The people who were waiting for the fight, who were waiting until the morning, felt bad.
One Twitter fan called the children's animation of the show "the sick joke".
"Because of a government policy, 6 a.m. was not a good time to show this content, so we had to switch to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the audio.
"'To Peppa Pig, yes, I know.'"
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they plan to create a future schedule to include UK viewers.
"I think we can probably solve this problem in the next game", Cocker said.
"But it is Saturday morning, and we cannot decide until Sunday, which is Monday.
But we're working on it.
And believe me, when it was translated, there were a lot of texts that went back and forth, and not all of them were pleasant.
We tried to fix it, but we thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't. It was a government problem.
And trust me, it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce it to five fights instead of six fights, and we tried for the fans, but it didn't work.
This time, it didn't happen".
The Desert Island CDs: Tom Daley felt sexually unattractive
Olympic diver Tom Daley felt bad about his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
I didn't realize that "things weren't quite like me" until I was 24 and in high school.
In the first CDs of Radio 4 Desert Island hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said that she shared her thoughts about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that after he became a father, he stopped thinking about winning the Olympics.
The longtime host of the show, Christie Young, took a few months off due to illness.
Daily, who stars in Laverne's program, said that she felt "unfulfilled" because "love of boys and girls is not acceptable in society".
He says: "To this day, my feelings of incompleteness and being different are real, and they give me the strength to succeed".
She said she wanted to prove she was "something", because she thought that if everyone knew about her sexuality, they would support her.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is a prominent LGBT activist who used her appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he felt successful because he lived a life of openness and freedom, and he wanted to give others "hope".
Dustin Lance, an American filmmaker who met the three-time world champion in 2013, said that falling in love with Black was "a surprise".
Last year, she married an Oscar winner 20 years her senior, but she said that age difference was never a problem.
"He's had so many challenges at such a young age",  who went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, says it's very hard to find someone of his age who has had so much good and so much bad.
In June, the couple became parents to Robert Ray Black-Daily, who said that "my whole outlook" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would have said all I needed to do was win the gold medal".
"You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son, Robert, was named after his father, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at age 40.
Daily said that he had never accepted his father's death, and one of his last words was about a fight in London in 2012 when he asked if he had a ticket and wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell her, 'Dad, you're not sitting in the front row.'
"I held his hand when he was out of breath, and I finally realized that when he was out of breath and he was gone, he was invincible".
In 2012, she won a bronze medal at the Olympics.
"To perform at the Olympics in front of my own people is what I knew I wanted to do all my life, because there was no greater feeling", she said.
It also inspired the choice of the original song, Proud by Heather Small, which inspired her during the Olympics and still stuns her today.
The Desert Island CDs are broadcast on Saturday at 11:15 (London time) on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson lost his form on Saturday at the Ryder Cup .
American Phil Mickelson set a new record in his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he had to get in shape to keep up.
Mickelson was in his 12th year of a two-year tournament, and in Saturday's game, captain Jim Furyk suspended him for the night.
The five-time winner, who is always in the public eye in America, spent the day as a fan and working on the game on the field to correct his mistakes.
Even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old driver who had never driven straight compared to other drivers would not have been very good at the long-distance Le Golf National.
While the track itself is not particularly dangerous, on Sunday, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth match, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who have won four points in 12 singles games, start the game well, Mickelson's game could be decisive.
Furyk said that he believed his man, and he said nothing more.
"He understood his role for today, found my arm, hugged me and said I'd be ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
"She is very confident.
He's a Hall of Famer himself, and he's contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I've never seen him play two games.
I had a lot of ideas, but this is what happened, and this is what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there just like everyone else".
Mickelson beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on a Sunday.
This could have meant the end of his Ryder Cup career, which had never matched his personal best.
According to Furyk, Mickelson's existence brought intangible assets to the tribe, and Mickelson won 18, lost 20, and drew seven times.
"She's funny, she's witty, she's smart, and she likes to make fun of people, and she can be a great member of any tribe", he said.
"This week, the young players were very interested in seeing him play and it was really exciting.
He gave more than just a game".
Captain Thomas Bjorn realizes that his main advantage may soon be gone
European captain Thomas Bjorn knew from experience that the lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup was not a guarantee of victory.
In 1997, the Danish player played his first match in Valderram, where the team captained by Seve Ballesteros scored 5 points more than the Americans, but won by a margin of one point, equalling their opponent in the final game with a score of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You tell yourself over and over again that we dominate in Waldorf, we dominate in Brooklyn, but we won in Brooklyn, we lost in Waldorf, and everything was fair", Bjorn shared after watching Friday's 5-3 and 10-6 game at Le Golf National.
So what history will show me and my team is that this is not the end.
Tomorrow you will leave.
Go and do as you are told.
It's not over until the friend shows the score.
We have a goal, and that goal is to win, so we have to keep the focus in mind.
I put all my hopes into the 12 players who played for us, but we all know who's on the other side. They were the best players in the world".
Bjorn, who admired the way his players played on the golf course, said: "I could never beat myself.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow's game is all about playing by yourself, and that's something else.
It's great to play with someone when you're good, but when you're alone, you're completely tested as a golfer.
Playing as fully as possible  should be the core message that players' brains can absorb.
You will go out quietly, and he will have to go out alone and do his best".
Unlike Bjorn, his rival Jim Furyk is looking for more than just the best players in the squad to play individually, and he cannot be replaced by Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have scored just three of their four points.
Furyk himself was involved in both of these final days: he was part of the victorious tribe in Brooklyn before the Europeans were finally defeated in the "Miracle at Medina".
"I remember every single insult that was said about him", said Ben Crenshaw when asked in 1999 how he got his tribe together on his last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want us to start fast, like you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the pulse is unilateral, it puts a lot of emphasis on the middle matches.
As we trained our squad, we gave the players a sense of being trying to do something magical tomorrow".
Thomas was given the control of the match and would play against Rory McIlwra in the main match and against Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood, Ian Poulter and other European players in the first half.
Bjorn said about the selection of individual players, "I started with this group of players in this order because this order covers every risky moment in this game".
The German battleship was again delayed
The new German Navy frigate was scheduled to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the outdated fleets of the Cold War, but due to system failures and problems it was not commissioned the following year, local media reported.
According to the military spokesman, Die Zeit, the commissioning of the new flagship of the Baden-Württemberg class, the Rheinland-Pfalz, has been postponed until the first quarter of 2019.
The ship was scheduled to join the fleet in 2014, but the fate of the ambitious project was complicated by the severe consequences of the delivery.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They will have powerful missiles, many anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and obviously invisible technologies, such as miniature radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer service life  new frigates must be able to operate for up to two years away from their home port.
According to Die Zeit, the constant delays will make the modern warships that could have helped Germany establish its foreign influence obsolete by the time they are put into service.
The F125 frigate, which had no runway, made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had ever returned a ship to the company that built it.
The reasons for the return were not well known, but the German media claimed that if the ship had been used in a combat mission, a critical "software and hardware defect" would have rendered it useless.
The software flaws were particularly significant because the Baden-Württemberg class ships are operated by 120 workers -- twice the number of crew members that operate the Bremen class ships.
The heavy weight of the ship also reduced its productivity, making it unsuitable for future naval improvements.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate was thought to be twice as heavy as the similar class of battleships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the broken equipment, the overall project cost is high, and training the team is a big challenge.
The total cost was a staggering 3.1 billion euros, although it was originally estimated at 2.2 billion dollars.
The recent warnings about the reduction of the German Navy have made the introduction of new frigates crucial.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliamentary defense committee, admitted that the navy was "really running out of ships".
The official said that the old ships were being retired but not replaced, so the situation was worsening.
I was disappointed that not a single ship of the Baden-Württemberg class was added to the fleet.
The National Trust is surveying the privacy of frogs
A recent study in Scotland aims to show how frogs use landscapes to find food.
The hope is that the results will help to study the behavior of these unique flying mammals and to help future efforts to conserve them.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland examined the common and soprano pipistrels, as well as the brown, long-haired frogs and dobentons of the Invererae Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders are installed at key locations around the hotel to monitor the frogs' movements throughout the season.
National Health Service workers and volunteers also use mobile phone detectors to perform screenings.
An expert voice analysis of all recordings will analyze the frequency of the frogs' calls to determine which species made the calls.
At the landscape level, their habitat is mapped and reported to give a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at the National Survey Service (NTS), hopes that the results will reveal which habitat is most important to frogs and how each species uses it.
This information can help determine the priorities of habitat management, such as how to create hedgerows and conserve forest masses for frogs and other species.
In Scotland and Britain, frog populations have declined in the last century.
They are threatened by the construction and development projects that have destroyed their lives and their environment.
Chemical cleaning of paper and building materials, as well as wind turbines, lightning, and attacks by pets, can pose a risk.
Frogs are not blind.
But their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to prey.
To avoid being lost and to avoid hitting objects, they use sophisticated echo-location techniques.
The National Inspection Service, which manages 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land throughout the country, considers the frog problem to be very serious.
The group employs ten trained experts who often conduct interviews, inspect fields, and in some cases rescue animals.
The organization established the first and only frog sanctuary in Scotland, at the Tribe Manor in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of frogs in Scotland live.
David Thompson, a real estate manager, said that this was a perfect place for frogs to live.
"We have a great frog area in Tribe", he said.
"We have old buildings, ancient trees, and a perfect environment for them to live in.
But much about frogs remains unknown, and our work in this and other areas will help us to understand what is needed to keep them alive".
He spoke of the need to check for frogs before repairs are made to private premises, since a single failure of a maternity home could result in the death of up to 400 females and young and the extinction of the entire frog population.
Frogs are protected and it is illegal to kill, abuse, disturb, or destroy them.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a senior member of the Scottish Frog Conservation Society, called on the community to help.
He said: "We still don't know much about our dinosaurs, and we don't know how many species live".
Ronaldo's rape case was dismissed because the lawyers are suing the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of sexual abuse against him "falsehood" and said that the people were trying to "make themselves famous" by using his name.
His lawyers are suing the German news outlet Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was convicted of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
The woman paid 375,000 dollars to keep the matter quiet, reported Der Spiegel on Saturday.
Hours after the allegations were made public, Cristiano Ronaldo, 33, posted a live Instagram video to a 142 million viewers, calling the news "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no. This is a very good idea.
What they're saying today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to make a mark for themselves in my name.
This is normal.
They want to be known by my name, but that's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are being sued for allegations that Der Spiegel "has questioned privacy with a deadly report".
Christian Schertz, the lawyer, said the gambler was "likely one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years, and the moral damage claimed is equivalent to the difficulty of the peaceful violation".
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in the Clark County Courthouse in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronald and Major returned to the player's room, where the player allegedly sexually assaulted her.
According to Majorga, Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and said that he was "99 percent" a "good guy", but that "one percent" was dominant.
In the documents, Ronaldo claimed that he had had sex with the girl, but that both parties had consented to it.
The major then contacted the police and took pictures of his wounds, but he later agreed to settle out of court, fearing "revenge" and "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman said she wanted to overturn the ruling because the alleged incident was still traumatizing her.
At the time of the alleged rape, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juve for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret losing its car manufacturers
Business Secretary Greg Clark said that if Britain loses its global leadership in automobile manufacturing after Brexit, it would "regret it forever".
Toyota's UK office told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without signing the deal, it would stop production at its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need this deal", said Mr. Clark.
A Japanese carmaker said that if Brexit is not addressed, jobs could be lost due to border detentions.
The Burnton plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, our factory will stop production", said a Toyota executive in Burnton.
Other UK manufacturers have expressed concern about how they would sell their Honda, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover and other products across borders if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.
For example, BMW announced that it would close its small Oxford plant a month after it left Brexit.
Carmakers are concerned that a failed Brexit will have a negative impact on their supply chains.
Toyota's production line is "on schedule", and production takes place every 37 minutes using parts from both the UK and EU to make vehicles that are ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29th without a deal, equipment could be delayed at the border, affecting overall production.
The company said that Toyota's spare parts in Derbyshire only lasted one day, so production would then be stopped altogether.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's future relationship with the EU was "carefully regulated and would not allow for border detentions".
"We need this deal. We want to make a better deal that not only helps us succeed in the moment, but also helps us seize this opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Not only Toyota, but all manufacturers, have reported that we must continue to work on a successful supply chain".
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but said that in the long run, the increase in costs would reduce the company's competitive advantage and lead to fewer jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a 24-year-old Bernaston union organizer, said that the number of workers in the union is growing day by day. "In my experience, once these workers leave, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have a clear and precise plan for our future relations with the EU".
According to the White House, the Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be postponed.
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed for another week" because Kavanaugh's race for the Supreme Court continues, he said in a White House statement Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the case of special counsel Robert Mueller, who has been investigating Russian election interference, Trump's ties to Russian aides, and the president's possible future obstruction of justice.
The question of whether Trump fired the deputy CEO and threatened Mueller's independence had been a source of rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been listening in on Trump's phone calls and discussing his possible impeachment under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the message.
But she went to the White House last week despite the news of her resignation.
Instead, on Saturday, it was announced that Trump was in New York at the UN, and that he would meet with him.
Trump said he would "rather" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee, as he had both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testifying at the trial, who had accused him of sexual assault.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate vote even further.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Regarding the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date is not yet set, but it could be this week, or it could be postponed for a week because of the Supreme Court case.
But we're still seeing it and we're in constant contact with the press".
Some reporters dispute this report: Sanders hasn't had a White House briefing since September 10th.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not because he disliked the "exaggerated reporting" of television reporters, but he added: "I can't say they didn't do it".
He then proposed to increase direct communication between Trump and the press.
"The president is having more Q&amp;A sessions than any of his colleagues before him", he said without any evidence: "We've seen those numbers".
Sanders' briefings will continue as before, except that "if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States a question directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We do this a lot, and you've seen us do it a lot over the last few weeks, and these events are replacing the press briefings that you get to have with the president of the United States".
When Trump leaves the White House or attends public hearings or holds press conferences with senior officials, he always answers questions.
One-man press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president seems to have shown why he might be creating this unpopular and shocking image for the press.
The Minister of Health writes to the NHS in Scotland about concerns about Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health wrote to the Scottish National Health Service thanking the EU workers and wishing them continued well after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, wrote a letter six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has agreed to pay for the costs of applying for EU citizenship for public servants.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the EU and the UN were expected to continue and lead to the expected solution this fall.
But the UK government is preparing for a no-deal scenario.
I know this is going to be a very troubled time for all of us.
So I just wanted to say again how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Our partners in the EU and beyond are strengthening healthcare, providing valuable experience and skills that improve the quality of what they do, and benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we wish you well to stay".
Christy Abercrombie had to undergo emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury
Michael Organ Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christie Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday.
Tennessee's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that he was injured before the game.
"He went out on the side of the road and fell", said Reed.
The trainers and medical staff put Abercrombie in a crib and put him on an oxygen line until further evaluation.
A Tennessee official told WSMV's spokesman in Nashville, Tennessee, Chris Harris that Abercrombie had not been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type/degree of injury" and that Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
A red-shirted sophomore, Abercrombie is playing his first season in Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
He scored five points before retiring on Saturday, and he had scored a total of 18 points during that period.
Foreign buyers are taxed more when they buy real estate from the UK
Tori's new plan is that when you buy a property from the UK, you will be charged a deposit from foreign buyers and the money will be used to help the homeless.
This would defeat Corbyn's attempt to attract younger voters.
Increased stamp duty will be charged to non-taxpayers in the UZ
According to the Treasury, this event will raise up to £120 million to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be required to pay a higher bond when they buy UK property, and the surplus will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May has announced.
This was seen as an attempt to reverse Jeremy Corbyn's success in providing young voters with cheaper housing and then bringing in more income.
The high stamp duty is collected from individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the surplus funds go to government efforts to help those who sleep on the streets.
The current mortgage, when you add the second and rental payments two years ago, will increase by a total of three percent.
The Treasury hopes to increase revenue by 120 million pounds a year.
About 13 percent of newly built homes in London are bought by non-UK residents, which leads to inflation and makes it harder for first-time home buyers.
Many areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "hot cities" because many foreign buyers live outside the country and visit occasionally.
The new policy came after Boris Johnson proposed lowering the mortgage to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of taking land and underutilizing it and suggested that Mrs. May abolish quotas for affordable housing to end "the shyness of housing" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a series of excellent housing reforms, including a rent control and a ban on innocent evictions.
He also wants to give the councils more authority to build new homes.
Mrs. May said, "This year, I want to dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream of a better life for every generation.
And that means fixing a broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live and work and build their lives here.
But it's not right for non-UK residents and businesses to buy homes on the same terms as hardworking British citizens.
For many people, the dream of owning a home is unattainable, and for those who sleep outside, it is very difficult".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to rule Scotland".
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his "top goal" was to be a Scottish manager in some capacity.
The 42-year-old Scot is currently enjoying a rebuilding effort with a third-placed club from the north-east, three points behind the top-seeded tribe in the Premier League.
He was in charge of the Scottish Premier League last summer, and this summer he moved to the Stadium of Light.
"I wanted to play for my country.
I got the B cap and that was it", Ross told BBC Sportsound in Scotland.
"As a child, my father and I often traveled from Hamden to Scotland, and I was always attracted to the area.
But I will only get this opportunity if I succeed in running the club".
Prior to Ross, Sunderland's governors included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloah Athletic is happy to be in charge of such a big club after having turned down offers from the likes of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"If I can bring this club back to the Premier League, that would be a success for me.
"If you look at the structure and the potential of this club, it should definitely go to the Premier League", he said.
"It's not easy to get him back in the league, but I can only feel successful if I can get the club back in the league".
Ross has only been in management for three years, having previously been an assistant manager at Dumbarton and the Worcester coaching staff for 15 months.
He then promoted the club to the third tier, before Alloa was expelled, and the following season, Saint-Mirin won the championship, before leaving the club.
Ross is now feeling better than ever in his playing career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a collection of nine real ways", he remembered, taking responsibility for God.
"I sincerely believed that management was better for me than playing football.
This may sound strange, since I was a good player, making good money, and enjoying my success.
But it can be difficult to play.
There are many things to do each week.
I still have the stress and strain of my current job, but I have to be a manager.
I always wanted to be in charge, and I'm doing this now, and I'm lucky to be in my own skin now that I'm older".
You can listen to the full interview on Saturday, September 30th on Sportsound on Scottish Radio from 12:00 to 13:00 London time.

The hot summer was a good time for pubs in Britain, but it was a tough time for restaurants.
The statistics show that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales, while restaurants saw a 4.8 percent decline.
Peter Martin, a business consultant for CGA, which compiled the statistics, said: "The good weather and England's longer-than-expected World Cup performance mean that pubs saw a 2.8 percent increase in sales in July, while restaurants saw even lower sales.
The restaurant industry dropped 1.8 percent in June, and it was even worse in July.
When comparing the number of pubs and bars that have a high alcohol consumption, pubs have a higher attendance rate than restaurants with fewer customers.
Pubs also saw a decrease in food, but not restaurants.
The people seemed to be just thirsty.
The sale of alcohol in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent a month, while food increased by three percent".
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results continue the trend that has been going on since late April.
When it comes to sales outside the country, weather and major social and sporting events are key factors.
Unsurprisingly, the restaurant groups continue to struggle, but the 4.8 percent decline in sales could be a blow to the overall year due to continued price pressure.
The long summer was a bad season for operators of hot food outlets, and the cooling of August will be the long-awaited respite".
Pub and restaurant sales, including newly opened locations, rose 2.7 percent in July, slowing new openings.
The network's sales monitor, Coffer Peach Tracker, is a leading benchmark in the industry for the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry, analyzing the positions of 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of £9 billion.
One in five children has a social media account that is not shared with their parents.
Surveys show that one in five children (some as young as 11) have a social media account that they hide from their parents
A recent survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rise in the number of fake Instagram accounts.
This news is threatening to be sexist
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children (including 11-year-olds) have a social media account that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts on the photo-sharing app Instagram.
This news has increased the fear of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of the students have a main account to show their parents, and they also have a personal account.
A mother who had access to her 13-year-old daughter's private account saw a message from a teenager that called out: "I'm being raped".
Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Principals Conference reported that 40 percent of teenagers between the ages of 11 and 18 have an anonymous account, and their race has acknowledged it.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, says: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers want to create online spaces that parents and teachers cannot find".
Eliud Doyle is the "voice of the athletes" on the Scottish athletics board
At the annual general meeting of the governing bodies, Eileen Doyle was elected as a non-executive director to the Scottish Athletics Board.
Doyle , the athlete and chairman of the athletics' most prestigious event, Ian Beatty, described the move as the biggest international opportunity for sports administrators in the last decade.
"Ellis is highly respected in the Scottish, British and world athletics communities and we believe that athletics in Scotland will be of great benefit to her", said Beatty.
Doyle said, "I'm trying to be an inspiration to athletes and I hope I can help guide and guide the sport in Scotland".
The 1996 Atlanta Games gold medalist in the 200- and 400-meter dash, who won a total of four Olympic gold medals, is now a BBC junior scientist who has been completely paralyzed after an ischemic stroke.
He tweeted: "A month ago today, I had a stroke.
I could hardly walk.
The doctors told me that only time would tell if I would recover.
It was a very hard task, but I have fully recovered and am learning to walk again, and today I am doing a sprint walk!
Thank you for your encouraging articles!"
The online reaction to the milk pump advertisement , which compared mothers to cows , was divided
The company that made the milk pumps caused a rift among online users when it placed a commercial that compared nursing mothers to suckling cows.
To celebrate the launch of "the world's first silent breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie released a music video to showcase the freedom that the pump brings to mothers.
Four mothers are dancing in a grass-filled palace to the following track: "Yes, I'm sawing, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't cow's nipples, these are my nipples".
And the chorus goes on, "Squeeze, suck, give the babies milk, suck, suck, I suck myself".
Despite this, the ad on the company's Facebook page caused a controversy online.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times, received hundreds of comments, and received mixed reactions from viewers, including many who have highlighted the "dangers" of the dairy industry.
"This is a terrible idea to use products in advertising.
They have to be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, just like us, but when they give birth, they kidnap their babies".
Elvie , a milkmaid , is hiding under her milk-sucking underwear
Another commented: "This is obviously a traumatic experience for both mother and child.
But why should they be used to advertise breast pumps for mothers who leave their babies with them?"
Another added: "It's a far cry from real life".
Others defended the ad, with one woman writing that the song was "ridiculous".
"I think that's a great idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I would have bought one.
I felt like a cow when I sucked the milk.
It's a little crazy, but I bought it on purpose.
It's a brilliant product".
Another commented: "This is a ridiculous ad for mothers who feel like crap when they vacuum at work and in the bathroom".
This is not a campaign to praise or condemn the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, all the women in the group showed us unidentified straws wrapped in their underwear.
The concept of the campaign is based on the idea that many breastfeeding women feel like cows.
But the Elvie Pump is silent, has no wires or tubes, is hidden in a breast-feeding underwear, and allows women to move around, hold their babies, and pump outside.
Ana Ballarin, a partner at Mother and early childhood development specialist, commented: "The Elvie Pump  is such an innovative product that it deserves a strong and provocative promotion.
And while we were looking for similarities between the needs of women and the needs of cows, we wanted to bring attention to breastfeeding and the challenges it brings, and also show the incredible freedom that it can provide in a fun way.
This was not the first time Elvie had appeared in a magazine ad for a vacuum cleaner.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked onto the runway to show off her product to designer Martha Yakubovskaya.
Hundreds of migrant children were gradually moved to camps at the Texas border.
While the number of people crossing the border remained the same in the first month, the number of detained migrant children increased rapidly, partly because of the harsh policies and policies of the Trump administration that made it harder for people and children to cross the border.
Many of the usual guarantors were undocumented immigrants who feared losing their citizenship if they tried to claim their children.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that prospective guarantors and other adult family members would be required to provide fingerprints and that these would be provided to immigration authorities.
Last week, senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official Matthew Albens told Congress that he had arrested dozens of people who had applied to the agency for unaccompanied child protection.
And then 70% of the people the agency caught were never convicted of a crime.
"About 80 percent of the people who are bail bonded or their family members are in the country illegally, and many of them are criminals.
So we continued to persecute them", said Mr. Albenz.
According to the shelter, to make cases more frequent, officials have introduced new rules requiring some children to appear in court within a month of their arrest, up from 60 days previously.
They often do not appear in person to defend their case in immigration court, but rather through videoconferencing.
Those who are found not to be eligible for assistance are deported immediately.
In recent months, the shelter officials have reported that the longer children are detained, the more anxiety and depression they experience, leading to violence and attempts to flee.
These problems are especially acute in larger places like Tornillo, where there are so many children that their problems are ignored.
Moving children to a dormitory without emotional preparation and without the opportunity to say goodbye to their friends is even more traumatic.
Syria has called for the immediate withdrawal of "supported forces" from the US, France and Turkey
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem called on refugees to return home despite eight years of war.
He also said that the Deputy Prime Minister Muallem said that foreign forces are operating in Syria under the pretext of fighting illegal terrorism and that they are "being investigated".
"They must leave immediately and without condition", he told the crowd.
Muallem testified that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions have been driven from their homes since 2011, is "almost over".
He told Damascus, "This holy war will continue until the whole of Syria is cleared". We need to clear the region of terrorist groups and "all illegal aliens".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, many of whom train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are fighting against President Bashar Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Mualem accused "some Western countries" of encouraging refugees to stay abroad by "spreading unreasonable fear".
"We call on the international community and international humanitarian organizations to help ensure their return", he said.
"They are politicizing what could be a real humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not help rebuild Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a buffer zone agreement between Russia and Turkey in the last summer of the Idlib insurgency has opened the door for political talks to move forward.
The Russian-Turkish agreement helped stop the largest offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a region of three million people.
Muallem expressed his belief that the agreement was "limited in time" and that military action against al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters and jihadists would be "radically eliminated".
The UN Special Representative De Mistura hopes to soon hold the first meeting of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Muallem warned that the panel's work on the Syrian government's participation in the committee was limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and was against interference.
Why Trump won a second term
By this logic, Mr. Trump could lose reelection in 2020, unless impeachment and riots end his presidency early, as many liberals hope.
This would be "the most dramatic end of a presidency in history".
As we see it today, there is no sign of people getting tired.
Since 2014, his prime-time government time ratings have almost doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has grown from 1.7 million viewers four years ago to 2.4 million, while MSNBC's "Rachel Maddow Show" tops the ratings with 3.5 million viewers on prime time news nights.
"This is not something we understand, and these people are being set on fire", said Neil Baer, the host of ABC's drama "Designated Survivors".
Neil Scovell, author of "Just the Funny Parts" and a veteran comedy writer, has another theory, in addition to some of the more shocking facts about joining the Hollywood Kids Club.
She recalls taking a taxi to Boston in 2016, just before the election.
The driver says he will vote for Mr. Trump.
He asked why.
"He said, 'Because it makes me laugh,'" said Mrs. Scovell.
Chaos also has a fun meaning.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the story lines from Washington can determine the future of the Roede and Wade rivalry, and whether immigrant families will be reunited and whether the health of the global economy will recover.
Deleting  is something that is only possible for privileged viewers.
But over the course of six hours, experts concluded that Bob Woodward's "deep background" for the cover of his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 strawberry jacket - a "sweaty, thick-skinned outfit" that The Washington Post called "a stutter", and Storm Daniels' graphic description of Trump's anatomy were exaggerations.
For example, I never watch Super Mario the way I used to.
Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, said about the frequent cast changes and the dramatic plot changes of Trump's show -- the national football team fight, Kim Jong-un's praise -- "You know this is a reality show because it's trying to do something different every night".
You miss an episode, you're left behind.
When I visited Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the North Shore of Kaua'iig, and it was a beautiful day, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC while CNN was recording.
He also couldn't keep himself away from Brett Kavanaugh, who was meeting with the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"I remember that day we were doing these crazy shows and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'"
"I thought it was a joke, but they meant it".

Foreign funding is pouring into the race for the presidential candidates
With congressional redistricting and two strong candidates battling for a seat, it's no surprise that a lot of money flowed into Pennsylvania's 17th district.
This is Conor Lamb, the Democratic representative for Pittsburgh's recently redrawn suburb, who won the seat in a special election last summer.
Lamb is racing against another Republican candidate, Keith Rothfuss, who is currently representing Pennsylvania's old 12th district, and it's tied with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old territories were given to the wrong Republican Party in violation of the Constitution.
The new 17th District race cut funding for the Democratic Campaign Committee and the Republican National Campaign Committee.
Lamb became a household name after winning a highly publicized election in Pennsylvania's 18th District in March.
This seat has been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States lifted sanctions on El Salvador because of its support for China.
Diplomats say that the Dominican Republic and Panama recognized Beijing, but Washington has been pushing back.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he owned a hotel in Panama before his partners expelled the ruling tribe of Trump's organization.
After "decisions not to recognize nearby Taiwan", State Department officials decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only imposed on El Salvador, which received US$140 million in 2017 in aid for drug control, development and economic support and other purposes.
The proposed sanctions on financial aid and visa restrictions could have been very hard on this Central American country, which has a high unemployment and high crime rate.
During the internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic development because a similar meeting last year was seen as an attempt to stop the flow of migrants to America.
But in mid-September, a senior administration official said that they wanted a conference and would not impose sanctions on El Salvador.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence will attend the conference in mid-October, which explains the administration's focus on the conference.
And the American ambassadors to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic have returned without any new tough announcements or sanctions from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussions described by three US officials, two of whom were diplomats, and agreed to remain anonymous about the internal discussions.
Their reports were verified by an external analyst close to the administration, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
History of the study
The next step could be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's obstruction of justice, which now has a wealth of evidence in the public domain.
According to reports, Mr. Mueller and Mr. Trump's campaign are also investigating Russian collusion in the election.
If Congress changes its mind, Mr. Trump will be held accountable to that body and he will be held accountable to his colleagues, who are running for reelection.
There are many "ifs", and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, nor does anyone know the fate of his European colleagues.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we're all making different choices, and it's going to affect how long the battle lasts.
If the West could resist Hitler and support the Czechoslovak army in Munich, German officers could have staged a coup against Hitler in 1938.
We were unable to stop the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history is determined by these critical moments, and the march of democracy will be faster or slower.
Americans are at a critical juncture right now.
What if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who oversaw the investigation of Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has been walking on fire since last year when he was reported to have secretly recorded a presidential conversation and argued that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the Times was inaccurate.
"What if the FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, and he is found guilty in the Supreme Court despite unreliable sexual assault allegations and false evidence?
And, furthermore, do we support Congress in a midterm vote that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we can pass these tests, democracy will last a long time.
But I think from my lesson in Prague, we're not going to lose.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, which occupied my embassy.
He survived, he came to America, and 60 years later, he sent me to that same swattered table to light a candle on Saturday.

Rangers Graham Dorrance feels optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday and after a draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, their win over the Australians will help the G Group to secure a strong position in the Europa League.
A knee injury kept midfielder Graham Dorrance out of the starting lineup for the first time in a 2-2 win over Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that as a springboard to a bigger success.
"It was a good game for us because Villarreal is a great rival", said the 31-year-old.
"We started the game with the thought that we would at least score something.
Maybe we could have scored more points at the end, but overall, it's a good thing we're still tied.
They lost the first half, but we won the third half.
Thursday is another important European night.
Maybe we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they did great in the last game, and even though we have the support of our people behind us, I believe we can go forward and do great.
Last year was really hard because I had an injury and there were a lot of changes in the club, but I'm very positive about this game.
The facilities are great, and the children are having a lot of fun, and the training is of a high standard.
I hope we can move forward and leave a great season behind and make it a success".
Women are losing sleep because of their pension savings
Even though the respondents knew exactly how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to their family members about it.
In a national survey, about half of the people said they had talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them have ever talked about it with their children.
"People want their family to support them, but they don't make the effort to talk about it", said Holly Schneider, president of General Life Insurance.
And that's where you can start.
Talk to your mate and children: If you do not talk about your desires in advance, you will not prepare your family to help.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and how you can get medical care, because this is a big factor in determining your cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
There are three ways to finance your long-term care, these are traditional long-term care insurance policies, a mixed policy (which helps cover some of the costs), or self-funding (depending on how long you have).
Prepare legal documents: Decide on legal issues first.
Give your health care provider a credential, and your representative will oversee your health care and help ensure that your wishes are honored if you are unable to speak.
Consider also the matter of a trust deed.
If you're incompetent, you choose a trustee to make financial decisions and pay your bills.
Remember the details: Imagine that your elderly parents are on their way to the hospital in an ambulance.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down all of this information on a piece of paper as if you had it.
"It's not about the money", Martin says, "it's about the doctors I see".
"What medications should I take?
Who will take care of my dog?
Make a plan for it".
In Ilfracombe , a man shot himself several times with pneumatic weapons
One man was walking home in the evening when he was shot several times with a pneumatic gun.
The victim, a 40-year-old man, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
The shooting, which occurred at 2:30 a.m. local time, was described by officers as an "accidental shooting".
The victim did not see the attackers.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are searching for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
More than 384 people were killed in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, and the death toll continues to rise.
The loss of communication caused rescuers to lose contact with Donggala, the area north of Palu nearest the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
After the disaster in Palouse, 16,000 people were evacuated.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala , Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located in the Bay of Islands on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, and has a total estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala  is a regency about 180 miles (300 km) long along the northwest coast of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is the administrative region located in the province of the same name, has a population of 299,200 as of 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy in Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also well developed in the province, but it is more abundant in Morawai, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Disaster Recovery Agency, Paul and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami struck in western Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in a seismically active region of the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
These are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, 2004, a powerful earthquake in northern Sumatra, off the western coast of Aceh, Indonesia, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, most of them Aceh residents.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died off the coast of Sumatra on the island of Nias.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and a tsunami strikes the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hits Mentawai, Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroys dozens of villages and kills about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake destroys the Pidi Jai Regency in Aceh, and people are in a state of panic, reminiscent of the 2004 devastating earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but over 100 people died when the buildings collapsed.
2018: A powerful earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily confined thousands of tourists to their homes.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Trey Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was charged and arrested for assault.
According to an Alaska police report released Saturday, a 29-year-old Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, for alleged domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, a woman's acquaintance took her cell phone when she tried to report a suspected crime to the police.
According to a KTUU report, Palin Mat-soo is being held in custody on a $500 bail.
When asked if he would confess his sin, he reportedly declared himself "absolutely innocent".
Palin was convicted of three counts of first degree murder, which carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a second-degree felony, which carries a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This was not the first time Palin had been accused.
In December 2017, she was convicted of assaulting her father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report a possible assault.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was convicted of domestic violence, obstruction of justice and use of a weapon while intoxicated.
His girlfriend said that he had slapped her in the face.
In 2016, veterans criticized Sarah Palin, linking her son's violent behavior to post-service trauma in Iraq.
Hundreds of people died in an earthquake in Indonesia
More than 384 people were killed when an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
The number of people affected by the blackout is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near the center of Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, Indonesia.
Videos of the earthquake have been circulating on social media.
As the tsunami hit, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to attend the Palouse Sand Festival.
The federal prosecutor wants to use the rare death penalty for a suspect in a New York terrorist attack.
The New York State Attorney General's office is seeking a rare death penalty for a federal crime that hasn't been used since 1953 against Saifullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people.
Saipov, 30, planned to attack a bike path in Lower Manhattan's West Side in October using a rented "depot" truck and ran over pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a death penalty notice filed with the Southern District of New York, to be executed, prosecutors must prove that Saipova "deliberately" killed eight people and "deliberately" injured them.
According to court documents, the death penalty is likely to be imposed.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including the usual federal prosecutor charges of organized crime, assault and vehicular manslaughter, for the terrorist killing of eight people.
The prosecutor said the attack required "careful planning and preparation" and described Saipov's actions as "abominable, brutal and depraved".
"Saipov inflicted serious injuries and killed the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anne-Lora Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlee, Ernan Ferrucci, Ernan Diego Mendoz and Alejandro Damián Pagnocco", the statement said.
Five of the dead were Argentine tourists.
It has been ten years since the last execution in the Southern District of New York.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug dealers but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
A federal case in New York City in 1953 in which Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple, were executed for conspiracy to commit espionage during the Cold War with the Soviet Union two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, had no regrets about his actions days and months after the attack.
The police said that the man said that he had no regrets about what he had done.
The prosecution concluded that an ISIS video on Saipov's phone inspired the attack.
The police also said that he had asked for the ISIS flag to be hung in the hospital.
He denied the charges under Article 22.
David Patton, a federal social advocate who defended Saipov, said that they were "deeply disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"The death penalty is the most traumatic punishment for the victims", Patton said, "not a life sentence without parole".
Saipov's lawyers had previously asked the prosecutor's office not to impose the death penalty.
Tory MP Nigel Farage said that Brexit deals should be held accountable
During the protest at the Tory conference today, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army".
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel warm" to Eurosceptics because Theresa May's MP suggested that she should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative agent Peter Bon said at a march in Birmingham that if Farage had been the Secretary of State for Brexit, Britain would have "left" a long time ago.
Mrs. May's particular challenge, as she tried to reconcile her deeply divided tribe, was when pro-Tory parties formed separate anti-Brexit protest groups in her city.
The Prime Minister is doing everything in his power to maintain his chess-like plan in the face of the attacks of Brexit, the rest of the EU and the EU.
Despite this backlash, the Allies continued to negotiate with Brussels, forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their plan and "chaos".
Mr. Bon told a rally in Sollihalle, "Leaving means leaving", that he had a "chess game".
He proposed that Faraj Mirz be made an equal and be subject to the agreements with Brussels.
"If he's responsible for this, we're leaving now", he said.
A member of Parliament from Wellingborough said, "I'm for Brexit, but we have to lose at chess".
In his speech against the EU, he said, "We did not fight the world wars to be independent.
We want to write our own laws in our own country".
Mr. Bon denied the idea that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote, saying, "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is a complete lie".
Tory Brexit leader Andrea Jenkins was on the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chess is not popular, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular among our party and activists who will elect us in the first round.
Stop playing chess and listen".
In a statement to Mrs. May, she said: "If the prime ministers keep their promises, they will keep their jobs".
If politicians are to buy the 2016 referendum, Mr. Faraj said, they should do it "in a way that they will regret".
"It's a matter of trust between the people and the political class", he said.
"They're trying to buy Brexit, and we're here today to say, 'We're not going to let you do that.'"
In a public statement, she added: "I don't want our political class to be left out when we are on the brink of buying Brexit.
"We will mobilize the people's army of this country that brought us victory over Brexit and we will not rest until we have an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, the Left marched through Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the city center.
After the group was released this week, several activists carried signs that said "Tories against Brexit".
At the start of the conference, the Labour Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for meeting with them via the app to discuss security issues.
"These are the people who say we can get all the IT systems and all the technology on the ground for Canada+, a free trade in Ireland, a free border", he said.
"This is a complete joke.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit".
Warren plans to run for president "hard"
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election, she would "go hard for the presidency".
According to the Boston Globe, a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future in the West Massachusetts town hall.
A vocal critic of President Donald Trump, Warren ran for re-election in November 2016 against Republican Jeff Dill, who was Trump's running mate in Massachusetts.
He was in the middle of the speculation that he would defeat Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, Trump held his 36th town hall meeting with his constituents in Holyoke since taking office.
The respondents asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren said, "It's time for women, including this woman, to go to Washington and fix our broken government".
Louisiana State University student arrested for shooting Sims
According to a statement released Saturday by the Baton Rouge, Louisiana police department, the defendant was arrested after shooting LMU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
At 11:00 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department announced on the Outer News Channel that they had arrested 20-year-old Deaton Simpson.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting and asked for help identifying the man.
Sims, 20, was shot dead outside the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
According to 247Sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday that "Wade Sims died from a gunshot wound to the head".
Wade was trying to be his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being there, using a weapon, and shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
The 6-foot-2, Baton Rouge native played in 32 games last season with 10 starts and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world championship after defeating Sebastian Vettel in a team-wide order
When Valtteri Bottas won the qualifying on Saturday, the Mercedes team was playing a big game.
On the road, Bottas had a good start and was beating Hamilton, because in the first two turns he defended his position and then called Fettel to attack his partner.
Fettel was the first to go into the hole and try to get Hamilton in the back of the net, and that would be the decisive moment.
The Mercedes crossed the lap later and started behind Fettel, but Hamilton collided with the wheel and took the lead, and he saw that Ferrari was unable to defend in the third corner and he didn't want to let go.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the set and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
She was ahead most of the race, hoping to finish faster and overtake fourth-place Kimmy Raikkonen.
Finally, after lap 44, he fell into the pit and could not improve speed for the remaining eight laps, as Raikkonen finished fourth.
Waltz has been doing a great job all weekend, so today was a tough day for him, and I knew he was a real gentleman because he gave me the opportunity to be around him.
The team played their best to win first and second place", said Hamilton.
Using Sign Language to Convey Bad Things
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday, saying she had not lied about the sexual harassment letter from Supreme Court nominee Christina Blasey Ford.
Speaking at a meeting with West Virginia, the president did not directly respond to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that what was happening in the Senate was showing that people were "deceptive, deceitful and lying".
"You've seen what's been happening in the Senate over the last few days, the deceitful, the deceitful, the lying people, the angry, the evil people, and it's amazing", he said.
"And even though you see the evidence and they're spreading it, they're like, 'Oh, it's not me.
I did not do it".
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, are you all right?
Remember the answer... did you sleep?
Oh, no, not really.
I'm not lying down.
He waited.
Are we lying... No, we're not lying", he said, to the senator's surprise.
A detailed indictment was filed against Ford Kavanaugh against Feinstein, which was filed in July and went public in September -- but Feinstein has never admitted to leaking information from his office.
"I did not hide, I did not divulge, Ford's testimony, his story", Feinstein told the committee.
"He told me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret".
The president, apparently displeased with her refusal, told a rally on Saturday: "Her sign language speaks the truth.
He may not have done it, but his behavior and his sign language suggest otherwise".
While running for the Supreme Court, the president accused the Democrats of using the accusations against him for personal gain, despite being accused of rape by three women.
"They are ready to return to power by any means necessary.
You are seeing something disgusting, they don't care who they hurt, they don't care who they hit, they just want to take control and power".
The Elite League: The Dundee Stars 5-3 against the Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars lost the Premier League on Friday against the Belfast Giants, who won the game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead early with the goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boville.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney elevated the clan before Dwyer restored the leadership of the giants.
Lucas Lundwald's two goals brought them to a draw with François Bouchard Dandy before the game was won.
This was Adam Keefe's third defeat in the Premier League this season, as they came to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two teams this season, with the Giants having won their previous three games.
Dwyer's opener came in at 3:35 in the fourth, Kendall McFall coming in from the assist, and David Rutherford came in to save, as Boiville doubled the lead after the fourth minute.
In the opening period, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game at 13:10, and Matt Markward then tied the score with Corny at 15:16.
Dwyer knew the Giants had the initiative in the first game, and he scored his second goal that night late in the first period.
The hosts rallied and Bouchard tied them again in 27:37.
Coona and Charles Corcoran teamed up, and they gave Nielsen the lead for the first time to Dundee late in the second quarter, and he made sure his team won in the final quarter.
The Giants have lost four of their last five games and will send Milton Keynes home for the next game this week.
A flight attendant died while trying to save hundreds of people on a plane from an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller was awarded the title of hero after he had helped hundreds of people to take off.
The earthquake and tsunami that struck Sulawesi on Friday killed more than 800 people and left many missing.
The strong earthquakes still hit the area, leaving many people trapped under the ruins of Palu.
Despite the fleeing of his colleagues, 21-year-old Antonie Gunawan Agung refused to leave the shaking control room at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He was on the runway at the time to ensure the safe departure of Batik Air Flight 6321.
Then he jumped off the platform, thinking that he was going to fall apart.
He died later in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, a spokesman for the Indonesian Air Force, said that this decision saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian news agency ABC News.
We arranged for a plane to fly from Balikpapana to Kalimantan to take him to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him before the plane reached Palu this morning.
"It was a great blow", she said.
Meanwhile, officials fear that the death toll could be as high as 1,000, as the Disaster Management Agency has announced road closures in Donggala, Sigyi, and Butong.
"The number of casualties is rising, as many are still under the rubble and many are trapped", said AFP spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
A 20-foot-high [6.0 m] wave swept through the city, and on Sunday, a mass funeral was held.
Military and commercial aircraft were bringing aid.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, the ambulance was bringing bodies.
Fresh water is scarce.
They robbed all the shops".
Jan Gelfand, of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross rushed to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find.
It's a tragedy, but it could be worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited Palo, and he addressed the Indonesian military: "I ask you to work day and night to implement the evacuation plan.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, an earthquake in Lombok, Indonesia, killed 550 people.
Air Niugini says one person is missing after a plane crash in Micronesia
The airline, which had earlier claimed that all 47 people on board had been safely evacuated from the plane that crashed in the Pacific Ocean off Micronesia, now reported one person missing.
According to Air Niugini, on Saturday, they lost a male passenger while counting.
The airline said that it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats rescued the other passengers and crew after the plane went down while trying to land at Chukchi Island.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the details of the incident remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane was on a runway in the region.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had lost its runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying too low.
"That's a good thing", said Janez.
Janez said that he and others on the sinking plane were able to escape through a water-up to their waists emergency door.
The flight attendants panicked and screamed, saying that they had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy's Coast Guard said that they helped rescue people, using a boat to help them get to shore before the plane sank to 30 meters.
Flight safety officials said that over the past two decades, 111 people have died in crashes registered by PNG airlines, none of which were related to Air Niugini.
Analyst reports the night schedule of a woman who was burned alive
On Saturday, a prosecutor filed a criminal complaint against a man in Mississippi for setting fire to a woman in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in the analysis of investigative assignments.
The jury used cell phone recordings to try to determine the activities of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night of their death.
Rowlett said that he had obtained location data from several phones, which showed that Tellis and Chambers had been out that night (he had previously given different instructions), and reported that the Clarion Ledger had been able to locate them.
When the Danes showed that Chambers had his cell phone, and he said that he had been with Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford admitted on Saturday that he was out of town that night.
When prosecutors asked Tallis if he was telling the truth about being in the truck with Sanford that night, Sanford said, "He's lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy is that Tallis said she only knew about Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The cell phone recording showed that they had known each other only a week.
After Chambers' death, Tallis said she deleted his messages, calls, and contact information.
"He cut her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to make its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge ordered that the case be referred to the arbitration panel later that evening.
Senior: What is reasonable hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wanted to challenge this negative attitude toward the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
High Breed from Bristol said hip-hop had moved away from its original purpose of political thought and social issues.
They want to get back to their core and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common saw a renaissance in Britain with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A nanny in New York sued a couple for being racist.
A nanny in New York sued a couple for discrimination and fired her because her boss called her "another black person".
The couple refused to admit that they were racist and viewed the accusation as an "attempt to collect money".
When Lindsay Placebo-Flaxman, a new employee and mother of two, Giselle Morris, went to work her first day in 2016, she was shocked to discover that she was black.
"A BLACK MAN WITH A BLACK WOMAN" , wrote Lindsay Placebo-Flaxman to her husband, who was a black man.
But twice, she sent the message to Mrs. Morris, not to her husband.
After learning of her mistake, Plaxson-Flaxman said she felt "uncomfortable" and that the current nanny, who was leaving, was African-American and poorly performing, so she was waiting for a Filipino worker, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was paid for a day's work and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Morris is demanding compensation for his dismissal, the equivalent of $350 a day for six months of his contract, but he was hired without signing a contract.
"I want to show them that they shouldn't", she told the Post on Friday, and then added, "I know it's discrimination".
Instead of calling him a racist, the couple were afraid to trust him after they had offended him, so Morris suggested that the decision to quit was the right one.
"My wife sent me a text message that I would not have shared with her.
He is not a racist.
We are not racist", her husband, Joel Plateau, told the Post.
"But even if it is wrong, would you give your children to someone who is rude?
A newborn baby?
Let them go".
Comparing the case to a "production effort", Plateau said that his wife had been pregnant for two months and was "in a very critical condition".
"Would you follow someone like that?
This is not a good thing".
The case is still ongoing, and the public prosecutor's report, which accuses the couple of misconduct and misinterpretation, has been widely circulated on social media.
The Paddington publishers were worried that the students would not accept a talking bear , according to a new letter .
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born after the book was accepted, wrote: "It's hard to be in the shoes of someone who's reading for the first time until this book is published.
We just found out about Paddington's big success story, and we were really laughing".
Sadly, his father, a BBC newsreader, died last year on the 60th anniversary of the publication of the children's book about the teddy bear.
She described Paddington as "a very important member of our family", adding that her father was secretly proud of his success.
"He was a very humble man, he was not a very proud man", she said.
"But Paddington was so real to her that he was almost like a child who had accomplished something, that you're proud of him even if he didn't.
And I think that's how he felt about the success of Paddington.
Although it was his design and his imagination, he always praised Paddington for his achievements".
I had to say goodbye to my daughter on the phone, and she was dying.
After her daughter was discharged, doctors rushed her to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice to save her life.
"Nad shouted that it was unexpected, that it was really bad", said Mrs. Edna-Laperous.
"Two minutes later, Nad, who was dying, called to say goodbye, and I had no choice but to say goodbye.
I said goodbye.
I said, 'Stone, I love you, my lamp.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.'"
The drugs that were given to his heart were slowly wearing off, and his body was dying.
Before all of this was over, she was dead.
I knew it was over, but I sat there, waiting for something.
I couldn't cry or scream or cry because I was surrounded by my family and other people.
I had to focus on my strength".
Finally, Edna-Laperouse, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, despite the ordeal.
"No one knew", he said.
"I bowed my head to the ground and wept.
It's hard to explain, but right at the time of the flight, I felt so sorry for Nad.
She needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved him".
A woman mourning her death on a mourning bridge
To distract them from committing suicide, two women who have lost loved ones work.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Douglas were leaving donation cards, phone numbers and support cards on Welsh Bridge.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to experience what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lidney, said that her son was a bright, smiling man who could become a great cook.
"Everyone recognized her for her smile.
She was said to light up a room with her smile".
Yet, he will be in the darkest place of his life.
In 2014, 11-year-old Tyler found his brother, who had committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I always wait for someone to knock on the door".
Mrs. Davis began making cards "to let people know that they have people to talk to and that they can be friends".
" It 's not about sitting still , it 's about talking . "
Mrs. Humphries was a close friend of Mrs. Davis, whose husband of 15 years, who had lost his mother, committed suicide.
"He never mentioned depression or anything", she said.
"The night before Christmas, he noticed a change in his wife's attitude.
She was different at Christmas, ignoring the children as they opened their presents".
"It gives the family a chance to cope with a loss and a stranger.
We are very sad.
But we have to deal with it".

Brett Kavanaugh's fate has been uncertain since the FBI began its investigation.
"If we conduct the limited time and scope of the investigation he has asked for, we may be able to reach some agreement", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that the committee was "forming" out of a deeply entrenched guerrilla standoff.
Why do Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation instead of a federal investigation?
Their refusal was conditioned by a deadline.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6th, and if the Republicans lose, as expected, they may not be able to vote for the person they want on the Supreme Court.
George Bush called the Senators and urged them to vote for Mr. Kavanaugh, who had worked for Bush in the White House and was married to Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI creates its own portal?
51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are in the Senate now.
If Mr. Kavanaugh gets at least 50 Senate votes, Vice President Mike Pence can vote for his nomination to the Supreme Court, but the question is whether he will get that many votes.
The number of North Korean deserters under Kim Jong-un is "declining"
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago.
Park Byung-seok said that there were 1,127 refugees last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011, based on data from the South's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Mr. Park said that the increased security at the border with North Korea and China and the increased interest rates charged by the guards were the main reasons.
North Korea has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
After the war, Seoul said that 30,000 North Koreans had crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many flee to China, which has a long border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily fortified border between the two Koreas.
China treats them not as refugees but as illegal migrants, often forcibly repatriating them.
Relations between the North and the South, which were still in a technical war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in North Korea to discuss disarmament.
This meeting followed a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who agreed to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-woo accused the US of not responding to the sanctions.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security in these circumstances, and we will never unilaterally lay down our weapons first", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "a hunger stranger" and considered him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "dumb", saying he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi spoke about this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"If a woman did this, I think they would call it very 'aggressive,'" Pelosi said of Kavanaugh Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the accusations that Dr. Christine had molested Dr. Blasey Ford when she was a teenager.
Kavanaugh was shouting and talking about his family and his high school years, and he was gasping for air and emotional.
He also accused the Democratic committee of "a ruthless conspiracy to kill" Hillary Clinton, organized by liberals angry about her 2016 presidential defeat.
When asked about Kavanaugh, Pelosi said that he was showing a Democratic bias and thus proved that he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
"I think it's a disqualification for the statement and for speaking against Clinton and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi was confused about whether Kavanaugh could be prosecuted if Kavanaugh's guilt was proven and if the Democrats had a majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he didn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not worthy to serve not only on the Supreme Court, but on this court", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of Columbia.
Pelosi Kavanaugh's decisions on affordable health care or Roe v. Wade are worrying me because she said it was a conservative court.
At his hearing, Kavanaugh refused to answer questions about whether he would overturn the Supreme Court's renowned rulings.
"It's a time when we go to a courtroom that is so hysterical and ignorant that we don't say, 'How wonderful!'" said Pelosi.
Women, on the other hand, should be skilled at this work.
It's an honest diatribe, months and years of insanity, and she can't get it out without crying.
"If we're angry, we'll cry", Mrs. Steinmeier told me 45 years later.
"I think it's not rare, do you?"
She said, "I had a female executive who helped me, and when she got angry and started crying, she developed a way to tell the person, and she said, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry with you".
Then he just kept going.
I thought that was a good way to do it".
The Bible says: "The one who is jealous of another is jealous of his neighbor".
One day, while I was in a mostly male-dominated job, I was crying bitterly when a much older coworker, whom I had always feared, came up behind me, grabbed me by the neck, and led me out into the hallway.
"They must never see you cry", she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and are glad that you're sad".
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he was running for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught with someone other than his wife on a boat called Monkey Business, and then he left the race, Mrs. Schroeder was so upset that she thought she should run for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", he said with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race, and they didn't want anyone else to join them.
Some called them Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
He finally voted, so he started fundraising late and vowed he would not run unless he raised $2 million.
It was a race to win.
He noticed that the people who gave $1,000 to other willing candidates gave only $250 to the female candidate.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced the campaign had failed, she spoke so emotionally that she was so grateful for the people who supported her, so displeased with the system that made it so difficult to raise money, and so angry at sexism that she went silent.
"You thought I was really nervous", said Schröder, recalling the reaction of the press that day.
"You might think that Kleenex is my sponsor.
I wondered what they would write on my tombstone.
"She was crying?"
How the US-China trade war benefits Beijing
Although the trade war between the United States and China is not over yet, experts say that the tensions between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued his first warning earlier this year to impose tariffs on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
There was a significant increase this week: 200 billion dollars' worth of goods were subject to new tariffs, and taxes were imposed on half of the goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has responded each time, most recently by increasing tariffs on US goods worth $60 million from 5% to 10%.
China will now answer for every step the United States takes, and the world's second largest economy will not die anymore.
Chinese President Xi Jinping understood that the only way to make Washington back down was to submit to these demands, but he was embarrassed to publicly bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the U.S. trade war could be a long-term benefit to China by reducing the dependence of the two economies.
"If Washington or Beijing makes a hasty policy decision, it could have far worse consequences for both countries than many experts predict", said Abigail Grace, an Asia expert at the New American Security Center.
The foreign minister says he is "ready" to welcome Syrian refugees back
Syria has said it is willing to accept the return of refugees on a voluntary basis and is asking for help to rebuild the country, which has been ravaged by seven years of war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Iranian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is stable and secure after the counterterrorism march", he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas devastated by terrorism.
All efforts are now being made to facilitate the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to flee terrorism, to improve their lives and livelihoods.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mullim said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for any help in rebuilding the deserted country.
But he stressed that he would not accept aid from countries that had financed the rebellion.
Europe consolidates its victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team defeated the US team in the 2018 Ryder Cup final at Le Golf National outside Paris with a final score of 16.5×10.5.
The U.S. has lost six straight in Europe and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
When Denmark's captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points, the score needed to beat the United States, Europe regained its crown.
The U.S. star, Phil Mickelson, who played most of the tournament, scored three pairs on the 16th hole to win the match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian was the star of all matches, and is one of only four players to have a 5-0-0 record since the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth beat the Danish Turbjörn Olesen, who was the lowest rated player in Europe, 5-4
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, beat England's Ian Poulter 2-1 and could have played in the final.
Sergio Garcia, an eight-time Ryder Cup veteran from Spain, is the leading scorer in European history with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't stop today.
It was a rough year.
I am grateful that Thomas chose me and put his trust in me.
I'm very happy to have won the trophy back, and I feel very happy.
The team decides everything, and I'm happy to be able to help", Garcia said emotionally about the European victory.
He handed the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 on Sunday.
"I'm excited to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play", said Ram, 23.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
He beat only Jack Nicklaus, won 14 titles, a staggering record for the greatest player of all time.
The U.S. team didn't play much in the tournament, and only Patrick Kamish, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau played at the highest level throughout the entire tournament.
After a disappointing performance by his team, U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought hard.
And one morning we were beating Europe.
We were killed.
We obey Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 players played brilliantly.
We're going to rebuild the team and work with the PGA of America and our own Ryder Cup committee and move forward.
I love these 12 kids and I'm proud to be their captain.
You should take off your head covers in front of them.
We were playing too much".
Red light updates: Decreased concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
A report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a decrease in red deposits in the Tampa Bay area.
The Commission said that the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier were in danger of overgrowth.
The red deposits extend from Pinellas in the north to the Leeuwarden region in the south for about 130 miles (209.21 km).
Similarly, the area around Hillsborough is also 10 miles (16.09 km) wide, but it is smaller than it was last week.
The red tide was also seen in Pasco County.
Last week, we reported average concentrations in and around Pinellas County, and then low to high concentrations in Hillsboro, high concentrations in Manatee County, high concentrations in Sarasota or nearby coastal areas, medium concentrations in Charlotte, high concentrations in Lee County and its coastal area, and low concentrations in Collier County.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier, respiratory allergies are still common.
Last week, there were no reports of respiratory allergies in Northwest Florida.
