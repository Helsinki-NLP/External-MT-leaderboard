The main task of the kings was to build a tomb which was thought to be as timeless as the stars would seem above the sand of the time, in which otherwise everything would sink. Planning for afterlife was more important than life itself, which was only the way there. Wars took them to remember it gloriously on the walls of this tomb, in whose stone the scenes were carved. Certainly, much was beautified, and in later times even battles were depicted which had not taken place.
