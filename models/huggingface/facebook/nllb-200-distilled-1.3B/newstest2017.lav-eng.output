28-year-old man found dead in a San Francisco department store
A 28-year-old man recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a supermarket stairwell this week.
But the brother of the victim says that he cannot think of anyone who would want to hurt his brother, stating: "Her life is finally starting to get better".
The body found outside the Westfield department store on Wednesday was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, a spokesman for the San Francisco Office of Forensic Medicine said.
San Francisco police say her death was ruled a homicide and is currently under investigation.
The victim's brother, Luis Galicia, told San Francisco radio station ABC KGO that Frank had previously worked as a waiter in Boston, but six months ago he was offered his dream job at Sons & Daughters in San Francisco.
A representative for Sons & Daughters says the news of his death shocked and shocked them.
"We are a small team working as a close-knit family, and we will miss him very much", said the spokesman.
Our thoughts are with Frank's friends and family at this difficult time.
Luis Galicia relates that at first Frank stayed in hostels, but recently his life has improved.
"He moved into a new apartment and met a girl", Lewis told KGO radio.
Luis Galicia claims he doesn't know who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man with a big heart.
"He always made his family happy by cooking a delicious meal and making lunch", said Luis Galicia
He never wanted to get involved in a controversy.
He was the brother who adapted to others.
"In comparison with everything that went wrong in the world, he was like a diamond in the rough, glittering every day", he says.
Anyone with information about the incident is invited to call the SFPD Information Line 415-575-4444.
New doctors strike: calls for new protests
Representatives of the new doctors are asking their union to start a protest over the new contract.
The LMA's Young Doctors Committee (YDC) is about to ask the council to support a wider protest in early September.
The JAK considers that the Ministers have failed to cast doubt on the contract.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the LMA's offer of a contract.
58% of all members who took part in the vote voted against the agreement.
In a tweet on Thursday evening, JAK board member Ellen McCort says the government remains silent on the matter and the deal has been rejected.
She said: 'In view of this, the JAC vote has resulted in the total rejection of the contract offer and the decision to request new formal talks to discuss the most important issues.'
In response to the government's silence, the JAC today formally requested a meeting with the LMA board to authorize the drafting of a new contract, which will come into effect in September.
The dispute led to six strikes by young doctors, including the first strike in the history of the NHS.
Following a vote rejecting the terms of the contract proposed by the LMA and recommended by the BMA, the new medical representative of the LMA, Dr Johans Malawana, resigned.
Before meeting with 54,000 new doctors and medical students, he had told the BMA members that the offer was good and would be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced that a contract would be signed with doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: A Forgotten Alliance?
A gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met Tuesday to discuss and announce the end of an eight-month war of name and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish leader at the St. Petersburg Palace, it was clear that Ankara needed this partnership more.
Yet, they both blushed.
Vladimir Putin's smile seemed composed and did not evoke warm emotions, even considering his usual restraint.
In contrast, the Recep Tayyip Erdogan has referred to Putin as his "dear friend" at least five times, a news conference review said.
I'm out of numbers.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to pre-crisis levels but would become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan acted as if nothing had happened.
I think his enthusiasm is causing conflicting emotions.
But Putin's radiant coolness shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the downing of a Russian plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow was the one that responded.
Putin accused Ankara of putting a dent in Moscow's back.
The abuse was even more painful because it came from a friend.
Rebuilding genuine trust will be very difficult, if not impossible.
Since November, the Russian public has changed.
For several months, government-controlled television broadcast aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were to blame.
The most serious were allegations that the Erdogan family itself profited from the illegal oil trade with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He himself, of course, denied it.
But the central message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
In the end, this meeting only happened because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could see this as a victory of sorts.
Ankara's benefit from the peace agreement is clear.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after a failed coup last month that tried to topple him.
Countless terrorist attacks have also shaken his position.
There are also economic motives.
The Russian sanctions have caused substantial losses, especially the ban on charter flights, which normally attract several million Russian tourists to Turkish resorts every year.
The number of visitors decreased by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies will also be relieved when regular flights resume.
They're looking forward to a feverish holiday in the Mediterranean at the end of the season.
Already this week, state TV is predicting a drop in fruit and vegetable prices as Turkey resumes importing fruit and vegetables.
As quoted in the local newspaper Vedemosti, "They get their tomatoes, we get ours".
But there were other political motives for the visit from Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what they believe is a weak response to the coup attempt.
The EU has also been a source of frustration over the protracted accession talks and the intervention of Putin, who is keen to exploit Turkey's alienation from the West.
The Russian leader has undoubtedly gained additional points in Ankara's eyes by expressing support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well, because it has deep-seated fears of regime change in the country.
The summit, held in this quaint seaside castle, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present what one analyst called an "alignment of the excluded", two nations that feel excluded by the West.
However, despite the publicly demonstrated unity, there are still considerable differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main dispute concerns Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacemaker, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposing sides.
After more than three hours of initial talks, the two presidents announced at a press conference that they had not discussed the issue.
The Turkish president has deliberately avoided questions about the differences between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on how the two countries can find common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility and the potential disaster of NATO member Turkey shooting down a Russian warplane, things have improved as the two leaders have at least resumed talks.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The Bank will continue to play a supporting role in the northern part of SKB, the Bank's Executive Director has announced.
Outside Scotland, the SPA will no longer be available.
Ross Makevans told the BBC in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the bank's ambitions on a global scale.
It has abandoned these ambitions because eight years ago the bank was close to bankruptcy and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, trademark strategists have used the SKB mark to protect other consumer financial brands.
The Bank has received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, starting with Six Nations Rugby and ending with Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
But now it is decided to bring other national symbols to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available to customers in Scotland, but it will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all SKB references, outside the head office and the official list of the stock exchange, will be renamed NatWest.
The Ulster Bank trademark is already used in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Now smaller private financial brands like Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank will also be in the spotlight.
Makevan was interviewed during a field trip with clients and employees in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: 'SKB will become a brand for our investors and for our staff, because we are now becoming more of a brand bank.'
In time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in its industry and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not sponsor the Six Nations and will involve various brands in sponsoring the sport.
"The time has come to become a brand bank, because we have long asked ourselves how to become a better bank for our customers", says the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical to announce that we would be a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
But by working hard and focusing on our customers' needs rather than our own, we have obviously made a big difference.
We can bring these symbols back to life, so I think now is the time.
Frankie Dettori scored his 3,000th victory by taking first place in the Newmarket Stakes on his horse Predilection.
Dettori topped the champagne, claiming his 3,000th victory by finishing first twice in the Newmarket race.
On Friday, jockey Frankie Dettori claimed his 3,000th victory in British history by taking first place at Newmarket.
He achieved this by winning his second race in this race, which took place in his hometown, riding the Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve this feat in a horse sprint race.
He's joined by Sir Gordon Richard, Doug Smith, Lester Pigott, Pete Eder and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Detori, who had previously won with Ghayyar, said: "It's something special".
I'm very touched that my family is here.
I am very happy that it was in Newmarket, because I have lived here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not the Royal Ascot, this is a normal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After their victory, the Detori and Predilection are greeted with applause and applause.
Two riders have achieved this record in the hurdles - champion Richard Johnson and the late 20-time world champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who set several records in his career with more than 4,300 wins.
Lester Pigott, the ninth Derby winner, has 4,493 career wins.
Frankie is one of the best jockeys in the world today, and it's no surprise that he has achieved a feat that few others can achieve.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactical sense sets him apart from other jockeys.
He's a fantastic racing driver, and his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to the sport for years.
A few weeks ago at the Epsom Derby, I told Frankie that he would have won 6,000 races by now if he hadn't been so busy with the weekends and the big races.
But seriously, it is a real pleasure to see Frankie regularly win races in the UK for 30 years.
He's a lively man, which is great for British racing, and he's a great jockey.
Frank Dettori celebrated this achievement with his trademark flying decision.
From wind-speed finish to flying decider, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British horse racing for 20 years.
This has been an adventurous journey.
He has won countless major races, including the famous 1996 Grand Slam at Ascot, and he survived a plane crash and a drug disqualification.
Three years ago, he struggled to come back from a six-month suspension, but he showed his strength of character by challenging those who doubted him to return to his best form.
And he could race for a while longer - Dettori has previously said he would be willing to race until he is at least 50.
Russian President Putin fires his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been in the inner circle of Putin's inner circle for years.
The 63-year-old politician is now appointed as the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin had "decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration", without giving any reason.
He was appointed as Deputy Head of the Russian Federation's Security Service in December 2012.
44-year-old Wayne is a frightened diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, Vaino graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
He was also involved in the repression of the regime in the so-called 'Donetsk People's Republic'.
After his appointment, he told Putin, "Thank you for your trust".
I believe the administration's primary job is to support your work as president of the country, making laws and enforcing your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov had asked to step down and recommended Vaino as his replacement.
Does your smile convince you?
This step has shaken Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov is an old and close associate of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, once worked for the Soviet security service in the GDR.
In this capacity, he was one of the most powerful men in Russia.
In a televised meeting, both men announced that Ivanov was resigning on his own initiative.
But despite the smiles on the cameras, it's rare to find an explanation that convinces, especially before the general election.
Is this a result of a power struggle?
No one knows.
But the official claim that a man once considered a potential president suddenly wanted to become Russia's environmental policy chief is met with great skepticism.
In a note on the Kremlin website, Ivanov tells Putin: "The fact is that in early 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this difficult, I might even say problematic, job for four years.
It turns out I've been in this job for four years and eight months.
He was appointed by the President of the Russian Federation on 1 January 2014.
He was previously Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Security Council of Russia and a former member of the State Security Service of the GDR, as is Putin.
In late 1990, Putin headed the Federal Security Service, the successor to the KGB, and Ivanov took over as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the office of President of Russia, as re-electing Putin for a third term would be unconstitutional.
But then another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, became president.
Putin became prime minister, and after three and a half years, he returned to the presidency.
A fish in a garden in Banff
A man in Banff asks for help in determining the circumstances of the fish species that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bean thinks 75 fish could be sand ducks that have been taken away by a water tank.
Mr. Bean, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of the fish on the website Periscope, hoping that someone might know how these two-inch [5 cm] fish got into his garden.
The Queen's Crossroads: the bridge is now connected to Fife.
The project, currently worth DM 1,35 billion, is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern part of the Queen's Sphere junction to the viaduct, which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
The first of the four connecting sections is completed, which means that the bridge is nearing completion.
The structure of the Fife Bridge is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables.
The project, currently worth AED 1.35 billion, is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Secretary of the Treasury Keith Brown arrived at the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queen Sphere Bridge".
In this project, we see an engineering solution that is unbeatable, with more than 30,000 tons of cement and steel used in the construction of this section alone.
Despite the enormous weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge to the viaduct is an extremely delicate process requiring extreme precision.
In total, more than 79% of the bridge deck is already built and the final stage connecting the bridge to Rosita will be installed today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for installation.
Michael Martin, project manager for the Fourth Bridge Connection, says: "The first connection is a very important point in any bridge construction".
In this fantastic project, the first link demonstrates state-of-the-art engineering.
After the final section of the road was installed and connected to the north tower, we had to connect the northern section of the road to the ground section, or viaduct.
This was done by moving the north approach section of the viaduct 700 millimetres south.
It was a huge and delicate operation.
The viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons, and had to be moved about 3 percent downhill.
Delicate because the gaps in both directions the team was working with were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, all went well.
Simone Bailsa wins gold in the women's floor exercise.
Forget about the stress.
Forget about the excitement.
Simon Bales is not worried about that.
Dynamic jumps.
They perform the ballroom exercises effortlessly.
He's unbeatable on the floor.
It's totally innocent.
And finally, the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, a 19-year-old American gymnast won a gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between herself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62.198 was a head-trick ahead of silver medalist and team-mate Aliya Raisman and bronze medalist Russian athlete Aliya Mustafina.
On Thursday, U.S. athlete Simone Bales practiced for the women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win the mixed martial arts title and the fifth top-ranked trainer, gradually cementing her reputation as the best trainer of her generation and possibly the best trainer in history.
When the final result was announced, she wept because the long journey to this moment was over.
This achievement puts him alongside such unrivaled athletes as Michael Phelps, who took his sport to another level.
Bailsa has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at the world championships, including 10 golds, performing combinations of exercises so magnificent, precise, and ambitious that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast I have ever seen".
In Brazil, she faced a final test, one that involved competing largely with the expectations placed on her rather than with other athletes.
She'd be disappointed if I went home to Spring, Texas without a gold medal.
U.S. athletes Simone Biles (left) and Alija Raismane cheer after winning gold and silver medals respectively in the women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Baillie won her first gold medal Tuesday at a special farewell party for national coordinator Martha Caroly.
Although Bales claims that he never expected this on his long journey to the top, it is not true.
Part of her presentation's free-flowing movements, including her distinctive acrobatic passing, are accompanied by Latin music that would fit perfectly on the street next to the Rio Olympic Stadium.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandparents as an infant and discovered by coach Amy Burman's mother on a field trip to the gym where the Burman Ducks were held, has now become a force to be reckoned with.
She hasn't lost a fight since the summer of 2013, and the winning streak can go on as long as Bales wants it to.
Although Mustafina had a slight lead in the two rounds, it was only an illusion.
The balance ball and free-range, the part of the competition where Bailsa will defend her championship title, are still to come.
She came out on top with a score of 15,433 on the pole and consolidated her lead with a score of 15,933 in the free skate.
Raismane looked at her gently as she waited for the results, which were only a formality, and she burst into tears of joy at the realization of a dream she had once written in her notebook.
Raisman's result was a small revenge for events four years earlier when she shared third place with Mustafa, but lost the bronze medal match.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, known to Americans as "Grandma", was proving to be a convincing leader.
After the snow's free movement, which cast doubt on her return, she could devote herself to aerial kissing.
Meanwhile, the viral Twitter post by 19-year-old Baillie, which she posted this week, now has a completely different meaning.
Six-year-old Mahay Brown, the "Brick-Sacred" survives a shooting in Philadelphia.
Police say a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, indicating that this is the second 6-year-old to be shot in Philadelphia this week.
The child's grandparents confirmed to CBS News in Philadelphia that it was Mahay Brown.
The parents say Brown was shot multiple times, including in the thigh, leg, arm and abdomen, but was still conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother, Delores Melendez, told television: "Her little body was just a box of sackcloth".
I can't believe this.
The boy is in critical condition and has undergone several operations.
His family says he will be fine.
He had to start in the first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown is one of four people shot in the Germantown area.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old men and a 32-year-old man.
CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, but the other two victims are stable.
The network reports that the child was found in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old victim in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of them were the assailants.
An investigator told CBS Philadelphia that the shooting was likely a multiple shooting.
Weapons cartridge casings were found at the scene, belonging to different weapons.
Looks like it was a long shot.
The shells were found on both sides of the pedestrian walkway.
"It appears that there were several armed shooters who were actively involved in the shooting", says Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi.
Several homes and vehicles were also damaged.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly checking surveillance footage.
A bullet that fell during the shooting Tuesday struck a 6-year-old girl's hand while she was playing outside her home in the Westokline neighborhood.
She's slowly recovering, but the police are still looking for the culprit.
Why do we need Simon, Gabi, and Laurie?
I call it the Olympic Women's Team of the Year for a number of reasons.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. team has never been this good.
Second, the team has three lightweights, Simone Bales, Gabby Douglas and Lauria Hernandez, who inspire many young girls from the region.
People can be proud that this team includes Alia Raismane, who is Jewish, and Madison Kociana, who is Catholic.
After all, this team truly represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latino athletes in the sport.
For the last four years, the top trainer has been an African-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabi were first and second.
These are impressive results.
At the last Olympics, Gabi Douglas was the surprise Olympic champion, and America had a chance to celebrate.
Now the world has seen the incredible exercises performed by three-time world champions Simon Bales, Douglas and Lauria Hernandez, performing unprecedented but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win the gold medal in the women's individual all-around.
Her teammate Aliya Raismane won the silver medal.
We've seen the best that this sport can do, but the rest of the country is a very different place in exercise classes.
Simone, Gabi and Laurie made the Olympic team, as did Allie and Madison.
She's the Olympic Champion because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four athletes, and this is Coach Martha Carroll's last year as a coach.
In fact, sports are expensive, and most athletes train in private athletic clubs, where they are supported by parents who pay for training, accommodations, travel, training facilities, hotels (for coaches, athletes and their families), and other expenses.
Most of these athletic clubs are located in areas of cities that can afford the sport.
These clubs are where athletes spend all their training, and it's a costly and long-term investment for low-income families.
Amy Burman, coach of Simon Bales, and Maggie Hainey, coach of Lauria Hernandez, have been coaching their athletes since both girls started running.
We need to provide young girls, inspired by Simon, Gabi and Laurie, with cheaper fitness training opportunities.
I started my athletic organization 20 years ago.
My organisation is based in Harlem and we offer over 15 000 free or low-cost physical education courses to young people in the city (mostly black and Hispanic).
In September, we will open a branch in Detroit, my hometown, to provide opportunities for local youths to experience this great sport.
The goalkeeper develops strength, agility, and coordination, as well as hard work, discipline, and goal-setting.
This combination ensures long life, good health, and success in school and at work.
This team is going to inspire thousands of young girls to try out for track and field, and that's fantastic.
It is very important to play this sport, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simon, Allie, Gabi and Madison, for the amazing demonstration of Girl Power, winning Olympic gold medals and motivating countless young girls from diverse backgrounds to become healthy, strong, successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's rejection of the offer, the young doctors plan to go on strike.
Ministers hoped to settle the dispute by reaching an agreement on a contract change with representatives of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 new doctors who voted rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to close the contract, saying the NHS was in a precarious position and further delays would only harm staff and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new contract, which provides for changes to the conditions of night and weekend work to improve working conditions during non-standard working hours.
Last night, Dr Elena Makourta, representative of the BMA for young doctors, said that young doctors still had serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it would deepen the labour crisis and not provide a level playing field for all doctors.
We've got eight weeks before the first group of new doctors sign the new contract, so we need to make progress because we don't have much time.
The BMA's efforts to resolve the problem through negotiations have been met with a reluctance by the government to engage and sometimes complete silence.
This is despite the fact that just last month, Jeremy Hunt said his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, stop the unemployment and work with the new doctors.
If he doesn't, the new doctors are ready for another protest.
During the last strike in late April, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed as nurses and counselors tried to replace doctors who were picketing.
Ministers hoped to resolve the dispute by reaching agreement on a change to the contract with representatives of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to increase the weekends' work rate for the 54,000 new doctors who will be covered by the new contracts.
NHS Chief Employment Officer Daniels Mortimer has called on new doctors not to go on strike.
Mr. Mortimer explains that strikes do not solve anything but only increase the pressure on overworked workers and cause anxiety, stress and discomfort for patients, caregivers and their families.
Over the last two months, we've been talking to the new medical committee and working with the Department of Health and other agencies to answer their questions about sponsors and whistleblowers positively.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues, such as employee placement, flexible training, additional training for returnees after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, school leaving and gender pay gaps in medicine, shows that employers, the NHS and the Department of Health are serious about implementing the agreements reached with the BME in November, February and May.
Medications at 2 pounds a day may reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of heart attack patients could be treated with 2 liters a day because officials recommend using it for more people and for longer periods of time.
The anticoagulant Ticagrelor reduces the risk of a second heart attack in people with heart disease.
These medicines are already prescribed 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a second heart attack.
NICE recommends using this medicine for 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
But currently, NICE, which is overseeing the NHS, recommends using it for four years after a heart attack to further reduce cardiovascular risk.
Each year, about 140,000 people in England have a heart attack, and a quarter of those have a second heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by a buildup of fat in the heart walls, forming blockages.
If the barrier ruptures, it can cause a clot, blocking blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
On the other hand, if the plaque separates from the blood vessel wall, it can enter the bloodstream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another heart attack.
Ticagrelor, which is made by AstraZeneca in the UK and sold under the name Brilique, reduces the risk of developing a clot.
New NICE guidelines published today recommend that people take 90 mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months and 60 mg twice daily for another three years with aspirin.
Professor Carole Longson, director of NICE Health Technology, explains: "Despite the availability of drugs to prevent recurrent heart attacks, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke, often with serious consequences".
Fear of repeated heart attacks can have a negative impact on a person's quality of life.
The evidence shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of recurrent heart attacks and heart attacks in people who have had a previous heart attack.
By provisionally recommending Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to extend the treatment options to thousands of people who are thus benefiting.
In view of the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding when used for longer than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend using it for longer than this period.
Political correctness culture promotes election fraud in Muslim communities
According to the management report, former mayor of Tauerhamlet, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed from office in connection with corruption.
The government report reveals that a culture of political correctness is leading to widespread corruption in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickle criticises the police, election monitors and city councils for ignoring signs of electoral fraud because of "fears of prejudice against ethnic and religious interests".
A former community secretary who has become the head of an anti-corruption organization says that religious intimidation is so widespread that police should be allowed to put guards at polling stations to protect the intimidated voters.
He also suggests that voters should show an identity document when they vote to prove their true identity.
Currently, only the name and address of the voter are required.
He even recommends that voters' fingers be marked with special ink to prevent double voting.
Reporters also need to be given greater protection, says Sir Eric.
He believes that the press should have greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: "The goal is not only to prevent election fraud but also to protect local governments from the broader culture of corruption that goes along with it".
The report was commissioned by Downstreet following the scandal surrounding the Tauerhamlet municipal election.
Last year, a special election court decided to remove Lutfur Rahman from his position as mayor for corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cynically corrupted" the religious views of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman campaigned on the belief that it is the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him".
About 300 votes were falsified or questionable because one person had voted multiple times.
Sir Eric also points out that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
He said that he was particularly concerned about mail fraud, where senior members of the Muslim community forced others to vote for their preferred candidates.
Sir Eric suggested a number of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document to establish a person's identity.
His report states: "Evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and youth, are being forced to vote for candidates chosen by the community's elders, especially in Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities".
"There is concern that the regional authorities will ignore these issues for political correctness reasons, as ethnic and religious interests may be compromised".
Sir Eric outlined 50 recommendations for improving the electoral system, including a ban on political activists handling postal votes to prevent "vote-taking".
The report, reviewed by Theresa May, also called for more rigorous registration checks to prevent voter registration from being used for immigration and benefits fraud.
Consideration of requiring voters to present an identity document before voting.
To mark the voters' fingers with special ink to prevent double voting.
Systematically verify a person's nationality to ensure that the person is eligible to vote.
Provide for a three-year limitation on requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibit political campaigners and activists from working with postal ballots and postal ballot envelopes.

Sir Eric Ash criticizes the Metropolitan Police for not having brought charges in the Tauerhamlet case.
He says: "The court disqualified Luftur Rahman and his representative for corruption and fraud".
He was convicted of a crime according to the standard of evidence of the criminal court, based on irrefutable evidence.
He also criticised the ineffective "cookie check" of the municipal voters at the voter registration booths.
Sir Eric observes: "The court decision last year is a wake-up call.
Our country is known as the home of parliament, but the alarming spread of fraud in secret elections and the failure of institutions to prevent fraud from taking place are jeopardizing this good reputation.
Cyclist-friendly - Keith's teammates and other Rio Olympic celebrities
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics will be thrilled by French cyclist Pauline Ferrand Prevoet, who fans have praised for her striking resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old cyclist is not the only athlete vying for the gold this summer, and the media report that she is proud of her celebrity partner.
So in honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who look exactly like Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: U.S. archery team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to Keith's fellow cyclist, many people online suggest that this sniper could be the twin brother of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. men's archery team member Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter when photos were posted of him looking very much like the Wolf of Wall Street.
The athlete himself noticed the storm on social media and admitted that he had been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
"I personally don't see much resemblance except for the beard", Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome fellow, so I take that as a compliment".
This year, one of the most popular pairs of London 2012 Olympic Games athletes will undoubtedly gain even more popularity: the striking resemblance between British distance runner Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian lightweight Alia Mustafina, with her large expressive eyes, has been compared to Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
When it comes to swimming, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to "Made in the USA" star Matthew Morrison for years.
Changes: This user has noticed that Nathan is a sports version of the actor from the movie "Inception".
Also old mates are tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who share similar features and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova and actress Annaline McCord are not only known for their sun-drenched skin and blond hair, but American athlete Nathan Adrian is also seen by fans as a Joseph Gordon Levit.
Women in uniform: Soccer star (left) Hopa Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar face shape and eyes.
Not just one: one Twitter user was pleasantly surprised to learn that others were also seeing the same images
Theory: this user thinks there might be a reason why the two look so similar
Recently, a Twitter user reported with genuine delight that "the rest of the internet seems to agree that Houpa Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look identical".
The American football star and "Dexter" actress does indeed have a very similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney. Similarly, gold medalist Gabi Douglas boasts a beautiful, wide smile that resembles that of "Bring It On" star Gabrielle Union.
A CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for his comment that the Chinese swimmer "ended up like a pig".
Byron McDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanha's fourth-place finish in the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay sent a chilling storm through CBC viewers.
Canada's CBC was forced to apologize after a commentator said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "skipped the competition, stank alone" and "ended up like a pig".
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when the women's 4x200m freestyle relay finalist expressed her personal views.
McDonald, who was added to the CBC commentary team to add vibrancy to the commentary, said: "That little 14-year-old girl from China can't keep up".
"She got too drunk, she was thrown out of the race, she smelled like shit and ended up like a pig".
Thank you so much!
14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan's time in the second heat was 1:57.79, 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to beat China.
Viewers across Canada immediately reacted online, shocked by the tone and expression.
Emmett McFarlane tweeted: "Did a live CBC commentator just say that 14 year old swimmers from China 'ended up like pigs'????".
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.
Ai Yanha of China in the women's 4x200m freestyle final was described as "a small 14-year-old from China who is not with us".
Criticism of Byron MacDonald quickly took hold as many demanded explanations.
Twitter users couldn't believe it when they heard Byron McDonald's insensitive comments.
Twitter user Sarah Parady wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like racists. #contrary.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was hosting the CBC live broadcast at the time, apologized for McDonald's comments, saying: "We apologize that the swimming commentary was broadcast live".
It was a bad choice of name and we're very sorry that it happened.
The CBC apologized to more than 90 people who had responded to the comment on Twitter.
MacDonald's colleague Scott Russell had to apologize for him.
The CBC then collected an apology from more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comment.
The network also quickly issued an apology and a statement.
We deeply regret that such comments were made and that they were broadcast live.
Yesterday we immediately responded and apologized to all of our live viewers and social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were made about the swimmer's performance, not addressed to her personally.
But in any case, those were unprofessional and unsuccessful words, and Byron deeply regrets what happened.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald personally apologized on the air and tried to explain that he didn't think his comment would be taken as a personal attack.
Speaking live on CBC's Olympic broadcast, he said: "I would like to take this moment to apologize for the comment I made yesterday after the women's freestyle competition".
I'm talking about the swimmer's performance, not her personally.
Needless to say, I didn't mean to be disrespectful and I'm really sorry that it happened.
Primark customers are shocked by a woman who is brazenly standing in the middle of the underwear store.
The shoppers were embarrassed when the woman began to undress to hang up her pants in the middle of the store.
To make matters worse, she held them to make sure they were on her, then took them off and put them back in the pantry.
She continued to look for clothes at the Bouverie Place Mall in Folkestone and put on four more pants.
Primark Bouverie Place Mall in Folkestone  the place where this woman put her underwear and then put it back in the wash.
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two, was also in the store. She said that the stranger put on her underwear and left without buying anything.
She points out that people could not believe their eyes.
Standing in the middle of the store, she took off her fleece underwear, took off her socks and pants, and measured them on the spot.
She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to measure them, she just kept them there.
Everyone was watching her take off her pants, and obviously she didn't like them, because she just put them back in her pants.
She weighed three more pants until she decided she didn't like any of them and left the store.
She did not seem concerned that anyone would look at or think about the person who would buy the clothes she was wearing.
Davidson, 33, in Kent, says: "It's a shame to think that someone will buy clothes that someone else has put on and that have not been worn".
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
"I assume that the store staff removed the clothes from the store shelves after she left", adds Ms. Davidson, "which is acceptable".
I can't imagine buying a new pair of underwear and finding out that another woman has worn them and then not wearing them.
A Primark representative stated that Primark was aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday 9 August.
The specific garments have been removed from the shop's shelves.
How to Protect Yourself From Firearms Using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com might make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect ourselves at close range from gunmen, we spoke with New York City Krav Maga Grandmaster Ron Mizrak.
Whether you are being attacked from the front or from behind, this video shows you how to protect yourself and gain the upper hand over an attacker.
Mizraki points out that if an attacker is attacking from behind, the first thing to do is to turn around to get a clear view of the attacker and avoid the trajectory of the bullet.
Then he shall place the weapon between his forearm and his shoulder and strike his opponent in the face with his free shield.
Then a fight ensues with a walk through the circus, and while the attacker is in pain, he must remove his weapon, put the barrel of the weapon in his face, and then step back, continuing to point the weapon at him.
If the attacker is approaching from the front, the situation is similar - avoid the trajectory of the shooter, grab the weapon, and position it so that the attacker cannot fire.
At the same time, you have to apply pressure to the weapon and you have to punch the opponent in the chest and finally you have to take the weapon away from him and you have to step back and keep pointing at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video to see how Mizrahi does just that.
But remember, if you're not a Krav Maga master, it's safer to give the robber your money.
The Vandals tear down the Saltaš' Cornwall social housing and throw them out into the street.
The Vandals have been evicted for terrorizing their neighbors, causing 50,000 marks in damage to their social housing.
Tanja Skeldone and her partner Sean Trebilcock were evicted from their property in Saltash Cornwall following a number of complaints.
When they were forcibly evicted, the housing authorities were shocked to find the property completely demolished.
The floor and walls were covered with holes, garbage was everywhere, and the walls were covered with graphite.
The family is now displaced and likely living on private property.
Donna Makeway, manager of the Cornwall Housing Authority, says there are concerns that the house will not be able to be rebuilt.
She says that the people who lived here had a very hard life, and she feels that people cannot live like this.
In this case, several factors must be considered, as the property will not have a good reputation in Cornwall in the future.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who stayed on the property periodically, and police say their terrorism was manifested in violence, hitting the streets with baseball bats, intimidating locals, drug use, drug dealing, and loud screaming and yelling.
47-year-old Skeldone, who owned a property in her name, was sentenced in June for antisocial behavior.
Most of the rooms in the demolished houses were found to contain waste.
The house, where drugs may have been sold in the past, also has several floor tiles.
Neighbors say they regularly walk the streets and constantly call the police.
The Cornwall Housing Authority evicted them from their property in a coercive manner when they had 11 weeks to leave voluntarily.
The desperate neighbors were very happy to be put away, for their lives had been a total hell.
One said, "They didn't care about the other residents".
We lived next door to them for 20 years, it's always been crazy.
You can't believe how many cops we've seen around here.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet in here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, this place is gonna be great.
Adams Fitzpatrick, head of neighbourhood protection at the Cornwall Housing Authority, said the family had not cooperated with local security.
My family's lived here for 20 years and the police are called here regularly.
Various old and unusable items were found in the garden of the house.
He also said: "It is a shame that the tenants have not shown any responsibility for their behaviour, as eviction is always the last resort considered by the Cornwall Housing Authority".
This was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and it was said that it was very difficult for the neighbors to see their behavior.
I appreciate the work that my entire team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the local authority, have put into this case, who have been brave and cooperative in providing us with the information we need.
I hope this event will make life easier for our neighbors and show that antisocial behavior is not acceptable.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons lived here at different times, but they're all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the rooms after it was laid out.
The service will now have to clean up the trash heap left in the house.
In 2014, police raided the home and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, accessories, and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldone was only found guilty of possession of Class B drugs with intent to distribute.
She claimed the money was intended for a memorial to her son Lee Sheldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
It turns out they're renting a private property in Plymouth.
Many of the houses had graffiti on the walls.
Police say they're continuing to fire tenants who violate their leases.
Devon and Cornwall Police spokeswoman Angela Crouch said the display was a clear warning to other tenants who continued to break the rules.
She also said: "This is a warning to those who think they can do whatever they want without any consequences".
Devon and Cronwall Police cannot tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
The willingness to spend can boost the economy.
Akropolis LT, which operates the Acropolis shopping and entertainment centres in Vilnius, Klaipėda and Šauliai, will be merged into the Acropolis Group of companies, inheriting all existing liabilities to Acropolis LT's partners and employees.
The merger of Akropolis LT and Akropolis Group is expected to be completed by 1 October this year.
We are entering a new development phase, during which we will implement large-scale projects, and we are therefore trying to simplify the company structure, which will allow us to create a more efficient team of professionals within Akropolis LT and the Akropolis Group.
We are currently implementing the major Acropolis development projects of the decade - the construction of the Acropolis multifunctional shopping centre in Riga and the development of a multifunctional facility in Vilnius, on the former Velga Plant site.
'The new company structure will allow the Akropolis LT team to make more effective use of its experience and competence in developing projects successfully and making the necessary decisions quickly,' says Saule Zabulionytė, member of the Akropolis Group Board of Directors.
The Akropolis Group is a group of companies that manages real estate development, shopping centre rental and management companies in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Bulgaria.

The mayor of Cannes has banned burkinis on the beaches.
The mayor of the southern French resort city of Cannes has banned the wearing of burkinis on the city's beaches, which cover women's bodies almost completely and are very similar to a bathing suit, local officials said on Thursday.
The mayor of Cannes, David Linard, has signed an edict that "all persons without a bathing suit that respects good manners and secularism are forbidden to swim on the beaches and swimming" as a fundamental principle of the French Republic.
"The wearing of plaid clothing that prominently shows religious affiliation at a time when France and places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks may pose a risk of disorder (disorder, clashes, etc.) that must be prevented", the order said.
"We are not talking about banning religious symbols on the beach, but about the fancy dress that is associated with loyalty to the terrorist movements that are fighting us", explained municipal utility manager Terry Migueel.
He added that burkinis had not been seen on the beaches of Cannes since July 28, when the law was signed by Linar, a member of the center-left Republican Party.
This week, an aquapark in Marseille cancelled a planned private event for Muslim women wearing burkinis after a scandal broke out among left-wing and right-wing politicians.
In France, Muslim women are prohibited from wearing face-covering headgear, but religious symbols and appropriate clothing are not.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed in a terrorist attack in the resort city of Nice, claimed by the Islamic State group.
On July 26, two militants who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State brutally beat up priests in a church in northwestern France.
Jysk increased turnover by 5% last year
The retailers of household goods Jysk Linnen'n Furniture ('Jysk') increased their turnover by 5% last year to EUR 23,66 million, according to information from Firmas.lv.

The management report states that last year the company reconstructed the existing store in Riga, on Slokas Street, and the lock shop in Riga, on Kurzemy Prospekt.
This year, as in previous years, the company's main objective is to continue to increase both turnover and profits.
In the meantime, the profits earned are recommended to be left intact.
Jysk is an international chain of stores offering home improvement products.
Jysk Linnen'n Furniture was founded in 2001.
The share capital of the company is EUR 3 500 264.

The Cuban Festival has begun in the island of Lucca.
On the evening of Thursday, August 11, one of the last festivals of the summer began in Lucerne, where "Cuba" will be held until Sunday night.
The first night was filled with acts like Enter Shikari from the UK, who were expected last year but suddenly disappeared from the show, American punk band NOFX, DJ Maxim from The Prodigy, and others.
The next days of the festival will also feature the names of Guano Apes and Garbage, punk rock legend Marky Ramone's Ramones drummer Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg, Brutto&Lyapis with Belarusian punk leader Sergei Mihalok at the forefront, popular Georgian actor and singer Vahtangs Kikabidze, Ukrainian Vopli Vidoplyasova and a number of other but complete events.
This is the second year that the Kubana festival is held in Latvia.
It suffered financial failure and huge losses in the past, but this did not stop the organizers from trying again - they added a long symbol to the name, included a Latvian group in the program (Friday evening at 19:15 on stage "All Day Long") and announced that the festival had now become "closer and gained local color next to symbols of Riga such as its landscape and cats".
Whether these efforts will be worthwhile is still to be seen, as the festival has only just begun, but as Delphi Entertainment noted on the first night, at least for now, the huge crowd has not been able to be attracted and the number of visitors has been similar to last year.
The British track cycling team broke the Olympic record twice and won the sprint.

The president who stayed in the shadows, Gustav Zemgal, 145.
On Friday, August 12, 145 years have passed since the birth of the second President of Latvia, Gustavus Zemgal.
Zemgal proclaimed Latvia a state, but has remained undeservedly in the shadow of the widely described first Latvian president, Jan Čakstė, and the last president of the pre-war period, Karl Ulman.
No other of our statesmen has stood up for democracy and the rule of law as Zeemgal, writes Arnold Auzin in a book dedicated to Gustav Zeemgal published ten years ago.
In an interview with Delfi, Auziņš stressed that Zemgal is one of the few high-ranking politicians who had a sense of humor.
The rest of them are stiff, always right.
He learned not to be like that, which today could be similar to what Raymond Vijon is.
"He was a man who was close to his people", says Autumn.
Modern politicians have a bad history, they refer to Carl Ullmann as a good leader, but few know how bad he was.
The only person in the cabinet he didn't call was General Balodis.
Even though he is kind and smiling in the pictures, he was hysterical by nature.
"The country, with its sense of humor and democracy, makes the opposite impression", says Mr. Ouzin.
Aivars Stranga, professor at the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia, agreed with Auza's assessment of Zemgal as a peaceful and determined statesman.
He also notes that Zemgal was outstanding in respecting minorities, regularly inviting Jewish representatives to the presidential palace.
"It was not a common practice at the time, but it was taken over by President Albert Quesada", says the historian.
He was a quiet, quiet man who had to be persuaded to run for president.
He didn't want to do it, he just didn't want the glory.
He was also quite critical of himself because he did not know French, but he felt that the president must understand it.
"During his presidency, he learned the basics of French", explains Stranga.
The lowly man refused to be persuaded to run again, and he did not like the very high office.
In any case, he is a very respected person in Latvian history, and even before he came to the presidential palace he held a serious position - he was a very popular notary.
Zemgal also ran the famous Zemgal cashier on Suvorova Street 3, where the society of stockbrokers and stock lenders was located, which practically became the Latvian state in government negotiations.
He was always progressive.
He wasn't much of a Ulman fan, but he didn't look good in public either.
"In private conversations, it has sometimes been said that Ulmann's actions are not really his thing", Strange notes.
They lived a quiet life, with no suspicion of lawlessness or corruption.
How is the Underworld remembered today?
Unfortunately, most of his associations are with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, his views were centrist.
"There were no major upheavals during his time, which means he could be associated with a truly stable presidency", Stranga sums up.
During the presidency of Gustav Zemgal, from 1927 to 1930, there was also a Latvian state visit to Sweden, which at the time indirectly meant full recognition of Latvia by the neighboring country and inclusion in the family of democratic nations of Northern Europe.
On 28 May 1929, Zemgal arrived in Stockholm on a state visit.
The reply visit of King Gustav V of Sweden to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second president of Latvia was born in 1871, but died in January 1939.
Simple ways to help your child cope with his anger.
I often encounter parents who view the appearance of anger as something wrong and abnormal.
When a child expresses his anger openly - we don't know how to react, says psychologist Ekaterina Kess.
The expert encourages a brief discussion about these natural and human feelings - anger and resentment - that everyone experiences from time to time.
Aggression is physical action directed at another person, usually when we are angry.
When we adults are angry, when we're upset, we usually know what's happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can express, suppress, hide, hold on to anger, tell our friends or other relatives, jump on the couch in anger, smoke a cigarette (not the best way to vent our anger!), shower, throw a bullet at a table, and do other things we would not normally do.
We don't turn our aggression on others because we know all sorts of other ways to deal with those emotions.
Children who are angry do not understand what is happening to them, how to express it, or how to cope with it.
They may say, "Go away!" or "You're an idiot!" or "You're a bad mom", or "I don't see you", or "I'm not going to date you".
Children live in a literal sense, they're completely in the here and now, they're spontaneous and honest in their expression, and they're often trapped in a variety of emotions.
It is vital that parents do not prevent their children from expressing their feelings, including anger, or to shame or intimidate them.
Do you need a break in a relationship?
A long day at work, when things don't go exactly as you would like, or just a bad mood - there are so many reasons to want to "disconnect" from the world for a moment, a day, or even longer.
Can we just get a little closer to the relationship and just breathe?
Does this mean that each partner is on his or her own path?
Gentlemen of all ages have their opinions.
John (23) is short and mean: "I think if you need a break in a relationship, you're not with the right person".
Meanwhile, Edward, 30, has found a pattern that may help.
If you feel that your partner is starting to get on your nerves about every little thing, this is definitely the time to explore other areas of your life to see if you miss him or miss him or even want to see him or her again.
So the answer is yes, taking a break can help you save time and realize how important your partner is to you.
Caspar (29) reveals his theory.
I think in relationships, you have to take a break from each other every day, because when you're with someone 24 hours a day, seven days a week, conflict is inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that they notice every little thing the other person does and they get on each other's nerves.
People get angry at each other, especially when there's nothing left to talk about except what you did that day.
My personal experience tells me that's why I haven't been in a relationship for more than a few months.
If you ever think that somewhere else or somewhere else is better, why does this woman you're with deserve someone who can think that this is not good enough and that beyond the mountains are fields of paradise?
Thinking is a little betrayal.
If not, then not.
"I have, so I'm a bit of a critic of those who don't", says Edmund, 46.
Karl (33) has the opposite view.
I think we all need a break.
You can't look into each other's eyes every moment, all the time, from morning till night, and rejoice in undying love.
Get out of here!
There's so much stuff going on, friends, work, parties.
Everything has its time.
Of course, so can a girlfriend or a wife, but if both of them can balance their family life with the outside world, it can survive to the grave.
That's it.
Says Martyn, 27, "It's hard to say whether you should or shouldn't, whether you should or shouldn't take a break, but one thing is clear - there's something missing in the relationship".
If that is the case, expect that some changes will soon occur - for better or for worse, depending on you.
I mean, you know, when you're young and crazy, you need a break, all the time, but when things get serious and things get to a whole new level, then you can't really talk about a break.
You're going to spend the rest of your life together!
"If you can't stand each other's company now and need a break every now and then, what will you do when you're retired and you're commenting on how long cats bark or arguing about which day is the best to mow the garden?" explains Chris.
All the gentleman's names have been changed.
With his lively and moving personality, Rosenthal was the first to arouse Latvian interest in the performing arts.
"In this sense he was the first love of the Latvian people, and as such he will be remembered forever", wrote Roman Suta of the Latvian master painter Jani Rosenthal.
Also in 2016, when opening the grandmaster's extensive retrospective exhibition in the main building of the restored Latvian National Art Museum, it is clear - Rosenthal is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition opened on 12 August, but it will be open to visitors from 13 August until 30 October.
The Latvian National Art Museum with a large retrospective in the newly opened Great Exhibition Hall features the painter Jani Rosenthal (1866-1916), whose one hundred and fiftyth birthday is included in the UNESCO calendar of celebrations.
The retrospective exhibition, which features more than 150 works, is one of the main events in the programme for the anniversary year of Jan Rosenthal.
The selection of works of art is mostly made up of the collection of the Latvian National Museum of Art, which convincingly represents the main stages and genres of the classical artist's creative activity, stylistic changes and the diversity of techniques.
In addition, exhibits from the Akseli Gallen-Kallella Museum, the Museum of Literature and Music, the Museum of Lithuania, the Museum of the Tuxedo and several private collections in Latvia and Finland were used.
The presence of photographs brings to life the atmosphere of the past century, and the mobile application of the exhibition reveals links to individual works of art with photographs taken by the artist himself with his camera for the purpose of the new discovery.
The Finnish-Latvian Society of Solidarity "Rozentāls-seura", named after the Latvian classic, is also presenting a small informative traveling exhibition "With a view on Finland, with a heart in Latvia" at the Latvian National Art Museum.
A similar exhibition with content in English, Finnish and Swedish will open in the autumn at the Virka Gallery in Helsinki.
Matt Leblanc is looking forward to his return to Top Gear.
TopGear host Matt Leblanc says he looks forward to returning to the show for season two, but admits he has no idea what the future holds.
Nothing official yet.
"If there is, the BBC will know", Leblanc told television critics.
Doubts about the future of "Gas on the Floor!" arose in July when LeBlanc's rep Chris Evans announced he was leaving the show.
After leaving, Evans admitted that LeBlanc and "Gas on the Floor!" were "made for each other".
Evans describes the former "Friends" star as "a real and loyal man", and bemoans that the two's friendship was strained during filming.
When asked what he liked most about the show, Leblanc said that it was traveling to other countries such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
The BBC has announced that the show is not planning to replace Evans for the 24th season.
Kalviņš: Meldonium could be removed from the list of banned substances for athletes as early as this year.
As meldonium, a drug produced in Latvia called Mildronate, is expected to be removed from the list of banned substances for athletes this year, said Ivars Kalviņš, director of the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis and academician, on Friday morning's LNT program 900 Seconds.
He said that he would travel to Canada in September to discuss meldonium with representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
The scientist expressed hope that Mildronate will be removed from the "blacklist" this year.
Two cyclists were taken to hospital after a collision.
Two cyclists were injured in a collision on Swiss Street in Sigulda, state police said.
The men involved in the accident were born in 1987 and 1990, both of whom were taken to a medical facility.

It's gonna rain and get colder in some places.
Also on Friday, some places in Latvia are expected to experience some rain and will get a little cooler, the Latvian Environment, Geology and Meteorology Centre has learned.
The following shall be reported in the table:
The forecast for rain is for Kurzeme and northern Wiedem.
Maximum temperatures will be only in the range of +16 and +19 degrees.
The day will be clear and mostly sunny in Riga.
However, the air will not be warmer than +18 degrees.
The backstage of American modeling business has been given the glitter of a perverted, crumpled photo shoot and the impatience of a horror movie.
It's a very provocative work, essentially, balancing the exaggeration and the vulgarity of the banal, where the lines between European art house and Hollywood's genre product territory are hard to draw.
The film, starring Viggo Mortensen, focuses on whether the conceptually chosen lifestyles of parents (ecology, vegetarianism, alternativeism and a break from the gullibility and values of the consumer society) bring blessings or destructiveness to their children.
An idealistic father of six is faced with questions about his choices and true values after the death of his wife.

Of course, the shark is only doing this as an attack on beautiful girls - in the Jokes, it was a swimmer, in this case, a brave surfer, portrayed by Blake Lively.
The job demanded her basic heroism.
This survival solo can be compared to James Franco's performance in 127 Hours and Ryan Reynolds' performance in The Living Dead.
Perhaps also to blame is the lead actress Mila Kunis, whose transformation from a model mother to a creative survivor and a near-deceiver of family values seems to be the work of a desperate Hollywood screenwriter's fantasy.
The Islamic State has captured 2,000 civilians in Syria.
Islamic State fighters fleeing Menbizh in Syria's Aleppo province have taken hostage some 2,000 civilians and are using them as livelihoods, a U.S.-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance and monitors said Friday.
"We did not fire on them because they took civilians with them when they fled to Djerbabulus", a spokesman for the Kurdish Menbizh Military Council said.
After two months of fighting, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance in northern Syria, announced on Friday that Menbizh had been liberated from jihadists.
He was also involved in the recruitment of fighters from the Syrian Arab Republic.
QSD already removed most of the Daesh fighters from Menbij last week, but some remained and showed strong resistance.
On Friday, however, they left the city, taking prisoners with them.
The Islamists are moving to Djerabulus, which is on the Turkish border.
The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) also reported that Islamic State had abducted some 2,000 people.
SOHR reported that the Islamists hijacked the cars of the townspeople, forced them to get into them, and then took them to Djerbaul.
The Islamic State has carried out mass abductions in the past.
In January, Islamists seized territory in Deir ez-Zor province in eastern Syria and abducted more than 400 civilians, including women and children.
Later, some 270 prisoners were released by the Islamists.
It is not known how many IS fighters have fled Manbij.
A spokesman for the Kurdish Military Council of Menbizh reported that the QSD had managed to rescue 2,500 people held hostage by Islamists in Menbizh.
The SOHR has collected information indicating that at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, have been killed in the battle for the lives of the Menbizes.
299 QSD fighters and 1019 jihadists were killed.
Kolegova declined to stand as a candidate for the post of Head of the Judicial Service.
The head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Kolegova, has decided to withdraw her candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID), LETA was informed in the Ministry of Finance.
The Commission has also been consulted on the draft law on the implementation of the law on the protection of personal data.
It seems that the real reasons for the debate are related to the visible, but more often than not, the invisible interests of politicians and have nothing to do with my assessment of professional competence.
"I also find this unacceptable", stresses the former candidate for the post of WFP president.
If her candidacy were to be confirmed by the government, it was clear that it would not be a convincing vote and would not allow the EU to work fully and implement the necessary changes with the full support of the government.
Without it, full-time work would not be possible, concludes Kolegova.
"I have made it clear publicly on several occasions that I do not want to be politically dependent, but at the moment my entire candidacy process is overly politicized", the official explains.
"Thank you for your trust and support, it is an experience I have taken as an asset", Kolegova writes in her application to Reiznieca-Ozola.
The unit stated on Wednesday that during the meeting with Kolegov, it had discovered a 'substantial discrepancy' between the candidate's explanations and the information available in public records on the dividend costs of SIA Pallogs, as the publicly available decisions of the Pallogs shareholders' meetings provide for no profit sharing.
The current Head of the EEAS is the Deputy Director-General Dace Pelēkā.
Police in Lviv are involved in rescuing two children left unattended, the Latgale Regional Department of the State Police has reported.
A report of unattended strollers was received Friday at approximately 7:00 a.m.
They were found in Lviv, near the former store building.
Both girls were immediately taken to the medical facility.
A briefcase with documents and a cell phone were also left in the cart.
Within half an hour, law enforcement officers located the parents and went to the scene.
When police arrived at the home of a woman, they discovered that she was sleeping under the influence of alcohol.
According to initial reports, the previous evening, the woman, born in 1992, was visiting a friend who was drinking.
On the way home from a meal, the woman decided to leave the children at the store, but under unexplained circumstances.
The police immediately informed the orphanage, which will decide the child's future.
The Port of Riga has implemented all the UK recommendations regarding the Russian Island project.
The Port of Riga Authority has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Control (SCC) regarding the implementation of the Infrastructure Development Project on the island of Krk to move the port activities from the city centre, Diena.lv was informed by the company.
The project is planned to be approved at the next Riga Port Board meeting.
In order to implement the recommendations in line with the VC's vision, the Riga Port Authority also followed the conclusions of the legal and operational audit carried out by the international auditor Deloitte at the Riga Port Authority and the recommendations made by the latter for improving the project management in the next phase of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations was also sent to the HR today.
Although the Port of Riga Authority does not agree with the UK's opinion on the merits of the island project, we are very responsible towards the project's implementation and the European Commission (EC) as the funder.
I would like to emphasise that all the construction works planned under the project have been fully completed within the time limits and the planned volume.
'To demonstrate to all involved in the project, including the EC, UK and the project stakeholders, that the main objective of the holiday is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all UK recommendations on project management and monitoring issues,' says Sanita Kaire, project manager of the Russian Island.
The existing long-term action plan for monitoring and monitoring the achievement of the project objective was supplemented by the main activities planned by the parties involved and the necessary decision deadlines, definitions and deadlines for meetings and regular reports, the planned monitoring tools for the construction process, as well as the definitions of the most important milestones.
The approved action plan for achieving the project target by 31 December 2018, in line with the recommendations of the JV, is complemented by performance monitoring activities, thereby reinforcing the timing control of the activities of other parties involved in the implementation of the project from the side of the Riga Freeport.
To improve project management and mitigate potential risks, a new project management plan has been developed, defining the project management areas and indicating the documents developed to provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
A project management framework has been developed to increase the project capacity, reflecting the structure of the planned project management team, the qualifications and functions of the staff.
In order to improve the communication between the Riga Freeport Authority and the project stakeholders, a Stakeholder Communication Plan has been developed which, in addition to the stakeholders identified in the Action Plan, defines the principles, methods and frequency of the stakeholder exchange for the successful completion of the project.
In order to improve control over the use of funds, the necessity and legality of the conclusion of a service contract or the initiation of a procurement procedure will need to be justified in greater detail in the future.
The project has built world-class port infrastructure on the Russian island, including four new deep-water ports, railway links and engineering communications.
The buildings co-financed by the Cohesion Fund were completed and put into operation at the end of last year, resulting in a saving of EUR 10.6 million in funding.
The threat has led to increased security at airports in Slovakia.
Following a non-specific threat, Slovakia on Friday stepped up security at several airports, the Interior Ministry said.
"In view of the threats, we have stepped up security at the international airports of Bratislava, Poprad and Košice", a spokesman for the Slovak Interior Ministry told AFP on Friday.
"The National Security and Analysis Center is currently analyzing the information we have received", he added.
An informal European Union (EU) summit will be held in the Slovak capital on 16 September, with the participation of all EU countries except the United Kingdom.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of the Brexit referendum in the UK and the future of the EU without Britain.
Slovakia holds the EU Presidency until January.
German researchers debate the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
A new study suggests that the death toll at the former Communist-held border of East Germany may be much higher than previously thought, but doubts remain about the true number of victims.
According to data released Wednesday by the Checkpoint Charlie museum at the Berlin Wall, between 1945 and 1989, 1,841 people were executed by the communist authorities of the West Germany who tried to escape from their territory on the border with the Western Bloc zones and later West Germany.
The museum has been investigating border deaths for years and is adjusting the death toll every minute.
This year, 11 more deaths have been recorded, including a six-year-old boy who drowned while trying to reach his family in West Germany via what is now Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are deserters from the Soviet army.
"The ultimate extent of the damage caused by the double evils of communism and socialism is not yet fully documented", admits museum director Alexandra Hildebrante.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died trying to escape the communist-controlled country are collected and preserved", Hildebrandt said in a statement.
But other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The number 1841 is not convincing", says Johannes Statz, an expert on the history of orientalism at the Free University of Berlin, in an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
He and other researchers at the Free University of Berlin are currently reviewing possible suspicious deaths at the border, and so far they have only been able to confirm 260 cases.
Previously, researchers estimated that 138 people were slaughtered by the Communists at the Berlin Wall alone.
The State estimates that the number of victims may be in the thousands, including those who have died trying to escape by the Baltic Sea or reach the West through neighboring countries.
But it's still significantly less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the different number of victims could be different methodologies.
Checkpoint Charlie also lists all suicides of East German border guards, whether or not they were directly related to their service.
The museum also lists deaths not directly related to violence.
"If elderly people in their 70s and 80s die of heart attacks after crossing the border", Hildebrante says, "it must be the result of this 'secret border.'"
However, the State believes that a distinction should be made between elderly people who may have died as a result of their experience of overtaking and those who died as a result of waiting for a long time in the hot weather on a bus at the border.
In addition, the counting of victims is not easy, since the Communist authorities in East Germany did not collect such statistics, and researchers have to search through various burned archives, the State says.
However, the State Group has recently produced new documents, and so it may soon be able to provide a new estimate of the number of victims.
The president of the LPF, Pone, is going to Rio with a coaching credential, which is a surprise to him.
The president of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF), Kaspar Pone, who has recently gained notoriety, has arrived at the Rio Olympics with a coaching credential, but he is surprised.
Tuesday's outcry was sparked by comments by Olympic swimmer Alona Ribakov's coach, German Jakubovsky, who revealed that he had decided at the last minute to go to Rio de Janeiro to Pone while the coach was staying home.
Initially, the list of participants included swimmers Alona Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, coaches Jakubovski and Dave Collins, and the president of the federation Mr.
The Latvian Swimming Federation has submitted five candidates for the Olympic Games, and even before the start Aldon Vrublievski claimed that Germans will be there and that he is looking for tickets.
"But obviously for objective reasons he did not", Pone said, noting that this did not affect Ribakova's result.
Uvia's coach, at the request of the federation, offered to help her.
Mr. O'Malley, himself a member of the Olympic Committee's executive committee, has been critical of the Olympic Committee's actions, blaming the Olympic sports watchdog.
I think it's unethical to confirm five people on the LAC executive committee and not appoint one of them.
"I don't know why the Swimming Federation didn't get a seat", Mr. said, noting that the work of the federation and its presidents was not appreciated by society, and that the presidents of the federation were not paid.
Mr. Jakubovski himself was also criticized, stating that before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not confirmed among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and called on Latvia not to send any athlete.
The man couldn't explain why he was in the Olympics with a coaching credential that was probably supposed to go to Jakubovsky.
"I was nominated for the position of president of the federation ("team leader"), but for some reason I received my coaching accreditation and now I'm not going anywhere".
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditations available changed.
I thought Germans would be there until the last minute, because I had no other information.
According to information available to the LETA, Ribakova had a face-to-face conversation with Poni a few days before the start and the swimmer was in tears afterwards, but the LPF president himself stated that it was a daily conversation with the desire to cheer the athletes before the start.
The Minister recalled that the LPF monitors five sports on the Olympic programme, four of which are also being trained in Latvia.
The Federation President said that the issues of water purification are also very important in Latvia and that he has also spoken about such programmes during his stay in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the federation and said that the World Cup stage could be decided in Latvia in 2018.
Being in Rio de Janeiro is not my vacation, I work here, I spend my time and I try to implement four-year programs.
600,000 baby salmon will be released into the river.
This week, the fisheries recovery programme of AS Latvenergo is launching salmon and catfish calves in Daugava, near Mangalsalo, and this year it is planned to launch more than 600 000 one-year-old salmon and catfish calves raised in the fish farms of the Bior Tomes and Dolles Scientific Institute.
The Latvian authorities have informed the LETA that the fishery will continue in the coming months, with a total of 6 300 000 juveniles and young of different species being released into the Danube basin each year.
In the spring and early summer of 2016, the release of cod and haddock, in June, of saithe, in July, of sole salmon, in August and September, of sandbars and wims.
The production director of Latvenergo, Mari Kuňickis, explained that environmental concerns are one of the cornerstones of the sustainable development of the Latvenergo Group.
'Every action in fisheries conservation and breeding is environmentally friendly in close cooperation with the Bior Scientific Institute, both by raising and introducing young fish into the Daugava basin and by other activities,' said Kuňickis.
This year, more than 600,000 year-old salmon and walleye pups will be admitted to the Daugava.
The young are marked by cutting the fat tail before being introduced at the age of two.
Today, 25,000 baby salmon weigh an average of 31.3 grams.
Every year, in scientifically substantiated species composition and numbers, young and carp are introduced into the Daugava and its basin waters.
The reproduction of fish stocks in the Danube and its basin waters shall be carried out by the Bureau in accordance with the legislation, on the basis of an expert assessment of the loss of fish stocks caused by the economic activities of Latvenergo and providing a conclusion on the compensatory measures to be taken to ensure the diversity of fish stocks.
The State Environmental Service, on the other hand, decides on the amount and type of compensation on the basis of that expertise.
The annual compensation of Latvenergo under the fisheries recovery programme shall be EUR 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016, Latvenergo, in cooperation with the association "We the fish", set up 400 artificial fish spawning nests in Daugava near Kaibala and Ikfeles for the fifth year.
Cooperation with the Fellowship to promote natural spawning of fish is an additional initiative supported by Latvenergo under the Fisheries Recovery Programme.
The installation of artificial larval nests in the reservoir is an important measure to promote the conservation and reproduction of fish resources in the Daugava.
The Sansousi Concert Hall is a country estate, a forest, a grove.
Camping, dining out, walking in chains, and listening to sophisticated chamber music while enjoying the peace of nature are all offered by the alternative chamber music festival in Sansouzi, which is inviting visitors to the Aknis district for the third summer.
The festival will take place in the grounds of the former summerhouse in Susseys, a village that no longer exists.
For three days, from 12 to 14 August, five stages will offer a combination of the carefree delight of nature and the exquisite delight of academic music.
It is the meeting place of musical theatre and contemporary circus, performances and installations.
Opera and academic music, especially in their more recent forms, find new listeners in a free and open environment free from the crowds of concert halls.
It's about 90 miles from here to the Rhine, but a smile and a light foot only a few minutes away.
"Please do not search for the programme, because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance, so that people do not go to one specific event or artist, because the real taste of Sansusi can only be captured by spending all three days there", invites the festival's initiator and host, operatic baritone Armand Siliņš.
The festival opens on Friday at 5 p.m. and the first concert is at 7 p.m.
Of course, there will be a program with all the information.
For those who have to choose one day, we recommend Saturday, since it is the busiest - from 9:00 a.m. until the next morning.
'The names of the teachers are available on the website www.sansusi.lv',says Armand Siliņš.
The colorful roster of artists includes violinist Eva Bindere, cellist Kristine Blaumane, opera star Inga Kalna, clarinetist Guntis Kuzma, trumpeter Jānis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zariņš, the Quadra and RIX quartet and even the Estonian aerial acrobat Grete Gross, who together with Latvian musicians Erik Kirschfeld, Martina Zilbert and actress Anci Strazdu created the contemporary performance Confines about the inner struggle of the artist.
New works have also been added for the festival.
The children's show "Kukainis", which was composed by Olesja Kozlovska and Jakob Niemannis based on the story of Kafka's Overvaluation, will be joined by Armand Siliň, musicians and actors, and entomologist (insect researcher) Ugiis Piterāns.
Oskar Herlins wrote the first Stryg Quartet, while Anna Kyrsi - Kok opera, a performance whose main characters, directed by Andra Kalnozola with video projections by Katrina Neiburg and set design by Andra Eglis, will be trees in three small bushes in a three-hectare wide barren field.
Singing to the voices of Lady Luck, Dinara Rudane and Sigmar Grah, they will come into a romantic relationship, much like the Enlightenment Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in The Wedding of the Cooks (1729).
The Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro are today starting with one of the Latvian delegation's biggest hopes, the seven-man athlete Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa.
The 100m hurdles will start at 15:35 and the high jump at 16:50.
The ball drop will begin at 2:35 p.m. on Saturday night, and the 200-meter sprint will begin at 4:05 p.m.
The sevens competition will conclude on Saturday with the long jump, javelin throw, and the 800-meter run.
Before the Olympics, Ikauniece-Admidinina, who won bronze at the World Championships last year, was mentioned as a contender for the Olympic medal.
In May, she set a new national record of 6,622 points and won second place in the prestigious heptathlon competition in Getsa, Austria.
Ikauniece-Admidiņa also competed at the 2012 London Olympics, where she finished ninth with a repeat Latvian record.
In the last year and a half, the athlete has broken the national record four times.
Today at 16:00 Latvian judo wrestler Artur Nikiforenko will start in the over 100 kg weight category, with his first match against the Azerbaijani athlete Ushangi Kukuri.
For Judith, this will be the first Olympic Games of her career.
Latvian judo fighter Yevgeny Borodavko lost up to 100 kilograms in his first fight on Thursday, LETA reported.
He was beaten by Japan's Hago Ryunoski, who went on to win bronze.
In 2000, Vsevolod Zełonij brought Latvia the Olympic bronze medal, but in the next four Olympic Games Latvian judoka in seven fights together won only one victory, which was won in London by Borodavko.
At 16:30 Latvian time, the shooting of the stand will begin with Dainis Upelnieks, but the selection will end on Saturday.
The Olympic pass was issued to the driver only on the day the Latvian delegation was officially announced, but he later told LETA that he had been driving reasonably safely since April.
The athlete arrived at the Olympic venue as one of the first Latvian athletes, trying to make the most of the training opportunities in the shooting competition.
The final three trips will be made by Latvian rower Ketija Birzule, 17, who is competing in the RS:X class.
After three days or nine trips, Birzule is now 25th in the overall standings among 26 athletes.
And on Saturday, the deciding medal round will be held.
Today, the academic rowing competition is also scheduled to take place, with the Latvian representative of Ireland, Sanita Pušpure, taking part.
Tuesday's race was cancelled due to bad weather.
The semi-finalists will compete in the women's singles at 7:10 p.m. for 13th place in the Olympics.
On the second day's quarterfinal lap, she finished fourth, from third position, which would allow her to continue the medal battle, trailing by a mere 0.65 seconds.
The Pushpure finished 13th in London four years ago, when it was also representing Ireland.
Today, 24 sets of medals will be awarded in archery, track and field, track cycling, hunting, wrestling, judo, track and field, shooting, swimming, tennis, and weightlifting.
Reid claims that if Clinton is elected president, she will appoint Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid is confident that if she becomes president, she will nominate Merrick Garland as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Republican Senate has been blocking Garland's nomination since March when he was nominated by President Obama.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that the next president will choose a replacement for current Supreme Court Justice Antonine Scalia.
During his press conference on Thursday, Reid announced that he was confident that Clinton would choose Garland.
Reid's spokesman later said he had not personally discussed the matter with Clinton and that it was all speculation.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team didn't want to "crash the ship" with another choice.
Garland is the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are "scum" and acting in the best interests of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also said that Trump was not fit to be president.
Treat announces a calendar of nude photos for women and men.
Treats magazine will collaborate with photographer David Belmer to create a 2017 calendar of Pirelli in the style of the 1970s.
In its 2017 UN Musical Calendar, it is planned to showcase new supermodels, not bare celebrity.
Earlier this year Treat magazine president Steve Shaw announced that his erotic arts magazine was different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is a men's magazine".
This magazine is for women.
It seems he's talking about a calendar, too.
In a press release about the calendar's creation, the show says: "We must return to the immortal and classic nude imagery, where the female body is not a fad but an inspiration for both women and men".
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a great piece of art.
Models can submit their photos electronically or in person at casting sessions in Los Angeles and New York.
In a racetrack, a customer tries a motorcycle and walks away.
On August 10th, at 10am, a Yamaha YZ250 was stolen from a house in the Rembates area of the city, which was not registered, state police said.
The motorcycle owner had offered to sell the motorcycle through the ministry.
At the appointed time, a potential buyer arrived, got on the motorcycle as if to impress it, and left.
The staff of the Ogres Police Precinct of the Riga Regional State Police Department ask for any information that may be useful to the investigation in connection with the crime.
Please call: 65002403 (working hours) or 65002400 (all days).
The anonymity of the informants shall be guaranteed.
Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video
Scientists claim that Greenland sharks have the longest life spans of any vertebrate on our planet.
According to shark researcher Julius Nielsen, the record for longevity belongs to a female shark that may be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
A French court rejects a request to close shops in the Jungle refugee camp.
A French court has rejected a request by the Calais authorities to close dozens of self-service shops and restaurants in the "Jungle Camp", home to thousands of refugees.
At a court hearing in Calais this week, authorities said the state should shut down 72 self-service stores where people sell products such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdressing services, 50 cents (40p) tea, and simple meals for a few euros in self-service restaurants.
The prefect's office in Kale stated that these self-employed enterprises should be excluded because they form a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as pose fire and health risks.
Human rights groups explained to the court that these small businesses are essential because the food provided by the government and aid groups does not meet the needs of the camp, which has a growing population.
They also noted that self-service shops and restaurants often offer free lodging and meals to those who need it most.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who had set up 72 self-made shops, but it understood the prefect's concerns in Calais.
Justice Jean-François Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food for people living in "extremely poor conditions".
He pointed out that these places are peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of being targeted is the camp's Jungle Book Kids cafe, which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French language classes, and asylum counseling for hundreds of unaccompanied vulnerable minors.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
A letter to the Guardian said that eliminating the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are as young as eight".
On Friday, two charities, Aid to Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, reported that the number of residents in the Jungle Camp had risen to 9,000, the highest number since the summer's surge in migrants.
Great Britain wins silver in the rugby sevens series, as Fiji State triumphantly wins gold.
The British team's impressive performance in the Rugby World Cup final came to an end on Thursday when they were decisively beaten 43-7 by the Fiji national team in the thrilling final at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.
Fiji demonstrated its mastery of the bomb, with foot-bombing, supporting, and brute-force, winning gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
The victory brought a respectable consolation prize, a silver medal, then Britain's third, and the British team could boast of their success in their first ever Olympic rugby sevens tournament, where they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The heavy fight in the semi-final, where the Boxers were beaten 7-5 in the first half, may have mirrored Britain's final.
But in any case, the Fiji selection is now in its best form to win the 15-man team.
While unlikely, it may be a consolation for Britain that at least one Briton has won a gold medal, and that is Fiji's head coach, Ben Ryan, former England coach at Wimbledon.
For Britain, it was an exciting adventure.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game in the Rugby Sevens in Adelaide.
They've only lost one game this time.
The injury is painful, but the growth is amazing.
Fiji began the battle with a spectacular effort to avoid the British's tactics of pleasure-seeking.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, it was like a collision with several buses headed in the opposite direction, and the World Series champions took a 5-0 lead as Hosea Collins took the first down.
In the final four minutes, Jerry Tuwai also increased his lead, landing on the right wing.
It's 12-0 and the British team hasn't even touched the ball.
Mitchell's great power play kept the typical Leon Nakarawa from getting three points, but it only slightly affected Fiji's result.
In the seventh minute of the match, Jas Veremalu scored a touchdown in the right corner, consolidating the lead over Great Britain to 17:0.
After the overtime, Nakarava had increased his lead even further and there was more than a minute left in the end... the end of the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some of the ineffective British force tactics and crossed the line to score points.
The score was 29 to 0.
It seemed Fiji was born to play rugby sevens while the British were just learning.
In fact, that's true.
The British team made a radical change in the half, breaking the Fijian line... for a full four minutes, which was good by first half standards, until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team performance, scored a few more points for the Fiji team.
Dan Norton managed to score points for the British team by landing in the left corner and making the score 36:7, but the game was already lost as the South Islanders fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
Fiji's lively attitude is not to be missed.
Matt Williams made Fiji's win even sweeter with another touchdown late in the game.
The Fijians were able to celebrate with the final whistle, but the British were left to sit on the grass after the score.
In the first half of the day, Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals, while the British were ahead of South Africa, where both teams were humiliated in a very close game and the South Africans lost by only a few points.
In the first half, Kyle Brown led the Boxers to the lead, but in the second half, Dan Norton made a brilliant effort to cross the line and pass the ball between the stands, ensuring the British victory.
Marcus Watson, brother of England rugby union player Anthony,'s superb power play at the end of the game secured the team's victory and another silver medal.
The coach's battle with cancer inspired Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win the sprint race.
It's gonna be the most emotional gold medal in this race, and that says a lot.
From the first to the last lap, the golden moment between Helen Glover and Heather Stanning was a special one at the Estação da Lagoa.
Although only two athletes were on board, they were accompanied by the support of Robin Williams, who inspired them to win their second Olympic gold medal in women's pair skating, becoming the first women in British sport to achieve such a feat.
They were undoubtedly dominant, as they won their 39th straight, unprecedented victory.
The two great athletes with their glistening elegance on the water's surface do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind every gold medal is a team that works hard to keep the athletes improving, and the biggest contributor to their success was a coach who, 30 months ago, didn't know if he would live to see this day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
He said it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had a lung cancer, which is one of the cancers that can be operated on, and it did.
If you don't, it will spread throughout your body.
And the situation would get out of hand.
It changes your perspective a little bit.
William was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
The trio managed to get William to begin his recovery process early in the 2014 offseason and reduce the length of the hiatus to a minimum, so to speak.
I needed to recover quickly because I needed to earn money.
It stimulated my recovery.
I was in the hospital and I walked six, 10, and even 15 meters, although the doctor said I could do a few steps.
That's how it all started.
The challenge of flying is itself a challenge, but this time it was even greater.
After the win, my first thought was of Williams, who had been very upset all morning and was talking more than usual in an anxious mood.
Stanning, who served in the Royal Artillery in Afghanistan, said: "It was an emotionally difficult week, but it means a lot to me".
It just confirms how much this means to us and how hard Helen and I and Robin have worked.
The last three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
We wouldn't have gotten anywhere without Robin, so thank you so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I can't think of a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The pair reaches speeds that rivals their rivals.
Even in the final 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Danish teams began to approach, Staning and Glover were too far ahead.
We've been living it up.
Helen was like, "Keep it up, keep it up".
Staying focused is really important.
We got off to a good start, but at the same time, we didn't have high hopes.
Our goal that day was not to throw records, but simply to run well and win races, and that is what we did.
He's gonna take a couple years off to figure out what he's gonna do next.
Next month is Glover's wedding to TV adventurer Steve Bashal.
For now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say that this was my last race.
It would have been too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience, and I was very nervous.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic".

To celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Los Angeles Central Library - with what else? - as a new book!
The EU's colleague in charge of the UN will "step up to the plate".
He said that it was now "essential" for Prime Minister Mariusz Kuczynski (Greens and Farmers) and Finance Minister Dana Reiznieca-Ozola (Greens and Farmers) to approve the candidates proposed by Finance Ministers, Kolegova, as leaders of the EU.
Rajevski estimated that the confirmation of both Kuczynski and Reizniece-Ozolo as the head of the UNODC in this government is the "first big decision" that could affect his future as a politician.
If they start changing their position now in choosing a candidate for the post of the head of the UNODC, it will negatively affect their image in the state administration.
The agenda of the next week's Cabinet meeting includes the question of the transfer of the Head of the VVD Kolegova to the post of Director-General of the VVD, according to the Government agenda.
Mr Reizniece-Ozola, Minister for Finance, promoted Mr Kollegov to the post of Director of the Public Prosecutor's Office following the resignation of Mr Ināra Petersone and the unsuccessful competition for the post of Director-General of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
In an interview with Latvian Radio on Thursday, 11 August, Dace Pelēkā, acting head of the Union of Independent States, admitted that if she were offered the position of head, she could accept it.
The Minister of Finance later admitted that he was not considering any other candidates for the post of Director of the Bank.
The leader of the National Union's parliamentary group, Ravi Dzintars, also acknowledged that the NA still supports Kolegov's leadership of the VID.
In Spain, the ability to form a government is threatened by the possibility of reducing the budget deficit.
On 12 July last, the European Commission (EC) concluded that Spain and Portugal had not implemented sufficient measures to bring the budget deficit levels down to the euro area's 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) target.
Despite the austerity measures implemented, the budget deficit in Portugal was estimated at 4.4% of GDP at the end of last year, compared with 5.1% in Spain.
The European Commission has, however, decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries while setting fiscal targets for the near term.
One of the reasons why the EC has not yet imposed sanctions on both countries is the growing Euroscepticism in many EU countries.
Further sanctions would only increase this negative sentiment.
Critics point out that the EC is inconsistent in its decisions, agreeing on uniform rules from the outset and then failing to apply them in practice.
For example, the president of the German Bundesbank, Jens Veidmann, has pointed out that Europe is thus losing confidence in itself by creating the impression that European Union rules are prescriptive rather than binding.
The Commission has now proposed and all Member States have agreed to extend the deadline for adjustment of the budget deficit to the end of this year for Portugal and to 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission vows to review progress in both countries in the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce further austerity measures if circumstances so require.
Initial forecasts suggest that Portugal's targets could be met within the timeframe and that the budget deficit could be reduced to 2,5% of GDP already this year.
This means that the national government has to implement austerity measures of 0,25% of GDP this year under the Stability Programme.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with an additional focus on controlling the cost of purchasing goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complex.
The budget deficit should be reduced to 4,6% of GDP this year, 3,1% next year and 2,2% in 2018.
In addition, consolidation measures should amount to 0,5% of GDP per year for the following two years.
The achievement of these objectives is made more difficult by the fact that the Spanish political parties have not been able to agree on a government for eight months and the growing possibility that Spain may have to hold its third early parliamentary election in a year.
However, opinion polls suggest that a third election would not significantly change the political landscape in the country.
The most popular party remains the People's Party led by current Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, which will again win less than 33% of the vote.
Only the Socialists have increased their popularity slightly, while the anti-austerity parties Podemos and Ciudadanos have declined slightly.
The People's Party wants the Socialists and Ciudadanos to join the government this month, otherwise it will not be able to adopt and submit the draft budget for 2017 to the European Commission for approval until mid-October.
As Rafael Hernando, a spokesman for the People's Party parliamentary group, has said, if a government fails to be formed and parliamentary elections are held for a third time, Spain will be the laughing stock of Europe.
The purity of the tides in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
After five years of surveying the beaches, activists have concluded that the number of litter found is increasing every year, and that the main culprit is the beachgoers.
The most polluted bathing areas are in Riga.
The idea of the capital makes it clear that while bathing areas are cleaned daily, it is difficult to control the pollution.
In addition, waste left on land during rainfall can be discharged into the water, thereby seriously impairing its quality.
With the exception of the beaches of Liepaja and certain places in Kurzemis, the cleanliness of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This is a statement released this week by volunteers from the My Sea campaign.
After five years of walking along the coast of Riga, activists have found that the amount of trash left behind by residents has increased every hundred meters.
Unfortunately, this year, that critical rating has come in.
"We see that this will be the year when the amount of waste on the beaches at 100 metres may even exceed 200 pieces", says Janis Ulme, representative of the My Sea expedition.
Latvian Radio called him and he was on the beach of Tuja, where the volunteer march along the Riga Bay continues.
This year, among the various household waste and picnic scraps, activists even came to collect the daylight bulbs left lying in the seashore.
Ulme, the participant and organizer of the parade, says that the pollution is caused by the inhabitants.
"The main source is the beachgoers themselves, as more than half of the total waste is plastic, a variety of waste, from bags, pieces of plastic that are already in the process of being disposed of and can no longer be identified, to fumes, bottles, caps", says Ulme.
Among the dirtiest beaches are the swimming pools in Riga.
For example, in Daugavpils, on average, almost 800 pieces of waste are collected every 100 metres, which is a critical amount.
The campaign also explains that almost every step is also a smoking stop and that there are not warning or prohibition signs everywhere.
"The average figures for all three Riga swimming pools together - Daugavpils, Vakarbulli and Vecāki - unfortunately are getting higher and far higher than the desired or target, which Latvia seems to be moving towards, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 by 2020", concludes the environment advocate.
Swimming pool cleaning in Riga takes place every day, even twice during the hottest summer days, explains the city representative Uģis Vidauskis.
However, dealing with unclean visitors is a challenge.
We're back to this issue of human culture.
"For those who chew, drink, smoke, and do all the other things they shouldn't, even the signs don't work", says Vidauski.
So Vidauski encourages visitors to the pool to report the pollutants to the police.
You can call the police, you can confidently point out these violations, and that way, everyone can fight back.
Maybe we can put in some new warnings, but like I said, it's not going to change things radically.
"By simply turning on each other and being intolerant of such offenders", he stresses.
Meanwhile, the Health Inspectorate has carried out its fourth water quality survey this summer, which could lead to a ban on official bathing.
This year, as in previous years, the water quality was good and satisfactory.
The current situation is that all 56 bathing areas have a consistently good water quality and no swimming restrictions.
"We will have the last analysis at the end of August", says the inspection's senior environmental health expert, Normund Kadyk.
During heavy rainfall, waste left on land can be discharged into water.
This, in turn, can affect its quality, says an environmental expert.
Rotation in the Russian elite continues, with a change of leadership in the Putin administration.
You quit your job?
Vladimir Putin told Russian media that Sergei Ivanov had resigned voluntarily and would continue to serve as the President's special representative for nature, ecology and transport.
Announcing the changes, Putin spoke to Ivanov in front of a television camera and said: "Dear Sergei Borisovich, we have been working together for many years and we are doing it successfully".
I am satisfied with the way you are carrying out your duties.
I remember well our agreement not to use you as head of this presidential administration for more than four years.
I therefore understand your desire to change the field of activity.
And I hope that you will continue to make full use of your knowledge and experience in your new role.
However, it is pointed out that running the presidential administration is a very important position and that this has made Ivanov one of the most powerful people in the country.
With Russia's parliamentary elections due next month, there are fears that the move is linked to a power struggle among Russia's political elite.
Ivanov was also mentioned as a possible successor to Putin in the presidency, so the claim that he himself wanted to take over the position of the presidential representative for environmental protection and transport has raised doubts.
According to the Lsm.lv archive, Ivanov is the commander of the General Staff of the KGB and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been an old and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He began his career in the special services in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
In the wake of the fall of the first Russian President Boris Yeltsin, he was appointed Secretary of the Security Council of Russia.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, Ivanov's "Information Security Doctrine" was approved, which included the revival of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergei Ivanov became Minister of Defence of Russia, and in 2005 Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov, responsible for the development of Russian defence industry and arms exports.
Now, after losing his position as Head of the Presidential Administration, Ivanov will also retain a seat on the Russian National Security Council, where the new Head of the Presidential Administration Vaino will also serve.
The culprit comes from the Soviet Party elite.
The head of the presidential administration was reportedly recommended by Ivanov himself.
Anton Eduardovich and I have known each other for a long time.
Since the days when we were in government under your leadership.
And we've been in touch almost every day for the last five years.
"I am therefore convinced that, given all his professional and personal characteristics, he is ready for this job", Ivanov said.
The culprit comes from a family that belonged to the Soviet party elite.
His grandfather, Karl, held high positions in the Communist Party of Estonia, including ten years as its first secretary until 1988.
The online publication Meduza, citing the book "Eguana's Self-Determination and Independence", reports that in the late 1980s, Karel Vaino asked Moscow for permission to use force against demonstrators.
However, he was refused and soon lost his job.
Shortly thereafter, Vinay moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino is a graduate of the Moscow Institute of International Relations and has a master's degree in Japanese.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the President's Protocol Office.
Several high-ranking officials have reportedly been fired and even arrested in recent weeks, including several regional governors and federal officials.
According to political experts, President Vladimir Putin has changed the ruling elite before the elections in 2018.
One of the main features is the increasing presence of representatives of the power structures in senior positions.
Judo fighter Nikiforenko also loses his first match at the Olympics.
This was the first round of the competition, and the Latvian judo fighter has finished 17th in the Olympics.
Coach Oleg Baskins admitted to Latvian Television that Nikiforenko's hopes were very low, and this was already clear before the competition.
He also revealed that a judo wrestler had suffered a shoulder injury in a fight.
Interestingly, to qualify for the Olympics, Nikiforenko had to compete in a weight class that was different from her usual weight class - the under 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani wrestler was 25 kilograms heavier.
It has been reported that in the under-100-kilogram weight class, Yevgeny Borodavko held out for two and a half minutes against Ryunosuki before his opponent scored the game-winning shot.
The Latvian Judo Competition in Rio has thus been concluded.
Dreams disappear in the sands of Rio.
Thursday's induction was by judoka Yevgeny Borodavko.
Yes, he faced a more formidable opponent, but ambition can sometimes surprise.
He didn't make it.
Arthur Nikiforenko's task was even more difficult, since he had less experience and a respectable opponent.
The result is similar, he held the tatami for about a minute and a half longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, lately Latvian judoka have been the ones who lack ambition the most.
Since the departure of Gunar Kirson and his financial stalwart Vladimir Shestakov from the leadership of the federation, Alexander Jakkevich left Latvia, there is no longer a "Golden Score", - the development of judo is on a downward slope.
Jackevich, who is here consulting for the Kazakhstan judoka, and Vsevold Zelony, who is not a heir.
But if he doesn't grow up, he won't.
And that is a Federation prerogative.
Because from another galaxy, the Morning Panorama, the president of the Latvian Judo Federation promised Rio a medal.
A flight away from reality.
Last night we were looking forward to the beach volleyball match between Samoilov/Smitish - Evander/Pedru Solberg.
The intrigue is like the death squad. The losers are out.
The Latvian duo had a slight disadvantage - they could lose, but not more than four points in two sets.
The tension was heightened by the long game before.
No one wanted to die, and that feeling was felt throughout the battle.
The winds of the trade created additional problems for the players.
At first, it seemed that it might be our most versatile ally.
But it didn't.
It was easy to play against the Latvian duo here.
Just serve Samoilov and wait for him to crack.
Canada was broken, Cuba was broken at the end of the first set and the beginning of the third set because the load was too heavy.
The smith could have done a lot of work at that time, but when he did, he did it well.
Samoilov and Šmēdiň could beat the Brazilians in two sets, as they took the lead in the first with 16:15, but they also remained at 16, exhausting the lost points limit.
But we could lose 0-2 because the second set was -4 behind, but even with the wind, we managed to win.
The third one's already overtaken Evander's serve line.
A chain was formed - a poorly received serve, the second-half often flew too close to the net and Samoilov was left with very few options for a successful attack.
If there was a stranger Samoilov in the field against the Cubans, he was more successful this time, and it would be unprofessional to blame only Sasha.
Craigie was wrong, too, and symbolically, he was the one who hit the last bullet in the block.
The team loses.
This time, too, the luck was definitely off, with only two of Evander's shots in the third set almost flying out of the court, but the ball still touched the line.
Two of them were right next to the line.
The video of the controversial episode also decided in favor of the opponents.
If Evander was a bit of a sergeant in the first two games, he was very productive against us.
It all came down to a loss on the board.
Now we need to calmly analyze the causes of failure.
Perhaps you should have lived next to the stadium, as many do, instead of with the delegation in the Olympic Village.
It took us two and a half hours.
Maybe a little confidence from the seven-game semifinal series.
Maybe I shouldn't have played in Klagenfurt, but I should have come here sooner and acclimated better.
Maybe it was a mistake to find the pinnacle of athleticism.
We're waiting for more questions than answers.
Our batting line is over.
The dream of medals is over.
What's next?
There are still some World Cup tournaments and also the Yürümqi Masters.
Shmytsyn and Samoilov have never been friends in their lives and they never will be because they have too many different personalities.
But that's not necessary.
When the dream of Olympic medals is shattered, the thought of divorce may also arise, for the blame will be placed not only on oneself but also on one's mate.
Divorce is not difficult, but it will be much harder to find a worthy partner in Latvia.
Both brothers play drums, but John and Tom have already tried and even split up, while Mikhail Samoilov is still too green to start conquering the world's peaks.
You can try Harald Regge, Alexander Solovej, Edgar Toch, go back to Martin Plavvin, but it won't be better than this option, which has proven itself many times in the World Cup stages.
The sand of Kopakaban did not smile at them this time.
That's all.
Of course, consider also the increasing popularity of beach volleyball, the introduction of new couples, and the rare occurrence of a man who is under six feet [2 m] tall.
This does not guarantee success, but it is a vital argument for victory.
The ones we have are not staying long.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to dine at venues offered by the organisers of the Games, as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some tennis players don't stay in the Olympic Village.
Also, some beach volleyball players have been looking for a hotel in Kopakabana.
This time, the very modest accommodations offered to journalists were highly overpriced.
That is why the choice fell on the apartment rent.
The risk is that they can be logistically inconvenient at times.
This time, the risk is worth it.
Vladimir Vladimirovich and I rent apartments on the border of Kopakabana and Ipanema.
200 meters to the waterfront, half an hour's walk to the bullring.
The neighborhood is relatively safe because of the favelas, but you can't lose your cool here either.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not what some people think of him, but the most professional sports journalist in the Russian media is Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. Looks like another medal dream was had Friday morning.
In the 100 metres hurdles and high jump, Laura Ikauniece-Admidynka broke her own personal best.
But there are five more disciplines.
After 10 years of hiatus, "Porgy and Bess" is playing in Liepāja.
In Latvia, the opera "Porgy and Bess" was premiered in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally acclaimed masterpiece has not been performed again.
That is why the organisers of the Kėdalas Art Festival and the Lelypas Arts Forum have decided to work closely together to give the audience the opportunity to enjoy the masterpiece by George Gershwin.
"We are delighted that after a ten-year break, when the last time July was able to enjoy an opera performance, this concert version of the great opera Porgy and Bess by George Gershwin is being enjoyed with us in the newly opened Grand Gintare", says the director of the Grand Gintare, Baiba Bože.
The opera "Porgy and Bess" is a story told in vivid musical language about love, its impermanence, passion, as well as the tragedies of life and the simple pleasures of everyday life.
It was a showcase for African-American vitality, music and rhythm.
It's this lack of political correctness in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance that makes it so alive.
"And yes, this romance is extremely strong, extremely beautiful and in some ways really deep", says director Stuart Kairish.
What I like most about listening to or performing this opera is that there are always these breaks -- the famous melodies, the famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, illuminating one character or another character or the choir or the orchestra.
"This is the most exciting building", says Andris Puga, music director and conductor of the Porgy and Bess Concert Hall.
The opera house's visitors agree that it is a grand event.
They are delighted to hear the world-famous Gershwin opera.
It's a blessing to be able to breathe the world in Liepāja.
"A professional performance", the opera is rated by visitor Edgar Lam.
The concert was special in that the newly opened concert hall "Big Gitar" was the first to have an orchestra playing in the orchestra's hall and the first to have an opera concert.
The area around the renovated building of the Museum of Fine Arts could be named after Jan Rosenthal.
At the opening of the Rosenthal Jubilee Exhibition, the Vice Mayor of Riga, Andris Ameriks, announced that the museum's address could be Jan Rosenthal Square 1 instead of Krišjāņa Valdemāra Street 10a.
Museum director Māra Lāce acknowledged that the re-registration of the address would create a considerable bureaucratic burden, but generally welcomed the idea and therefore agreed with the municipality's proposal.
The city of Riga laid a kind of foundation for this idea in 1936 when it created a monument to Janim Rosenthal, who stands at the museum.
The then director of the museum, Wilhelm Purvitz, was one of the initiators of the monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I'm always a little bit guilty, but Wilhelm Purwitz, where do we put his name?!
"But if you, Mr. America, promise to think about it"... said the Lick.
The National Museum of Art is reportedly closing its doors in May after extensive renovation and modernization.
This week, the VEF will finally begin the reconstruction of the Palace of Culture.
The castle will be renovated by SIA Velve at a cost of approximately EUR 11 million.
Plans are underway to renovate several palace buildings, including two auditoriums, and to adapt the building to accommodate people with reduced mobility.
The Riga City Hall has decided to raise EUR 6 million from the European Union funds for the project, but Oleg Burov, Director of the Property Department of the City Hall, admits that there is still no clarity on the European funding for the project.
"Although the political will to start the renovation work of the VEF Cultural Palace by mobilising European Structural Funds is there, we have been waiting for months for a decision, for real action from the Finance Ministry officials, whether the money is granted or not", says Burov.
Last December we were told that everything was up to Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Treasury Department received a letter from the European Commission asking you to make your own decision, not Brussels's.
Now we're seeing another round of discussion happening again, so let's see what we can expect in the next few days.
"I want to say that the Riga City Council guarantees without any doubt that this process will be started and completed on time", Burov said.
It has already been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, the VEF Palace of Culture collectively held a farewell concert before the imminent, imminent renovation of the building.
Although a year had passed, the renovation of the building had not yet begun and the collective continued to work under unfavourable conditions.
The strategy of the Région Municipal Property Department for the renovation of the VEF Palace of Culture is divided into seemingly independent groups of renovation works, each of which will ensure the implementation of different functions of the palace.
First, the accessibility of the VEF Palace of Culture and the improvement of the surrounding area.
It includes the improvement of the surroundings and the engineering of communications, as well as the renovation of the building's facade.
Secondly, the improvement of the VEF Palace of Culture's service offer.
It plans to restore the building's interior, walls and ceilings, improve the stage and sound recording studio, and arrange the building's internal engineering communications.
Thirdly, improving working conditions for amateur creative groups, including plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of "Līvu" the legendary rock band can be introduced at an exhibition in Liepāja.
The exhibition will feature a variety of items that characterize Livus - photographs arranged in a timeline to show the group's activities from its beginnings to 2010, when the group's closure is announced.
The participants' costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert recordings, as well as other items not yet seen by the general public, reflecting the creative work of the group "Livi" will also be shown.
The exhibition will be complemented by items from the collection of the Museum of Liepāja.
The visual design of the exhibition was created in collaboration with the fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalniec.
Musicians associated with the group and their associates also responded by sharing objects and memories.
The origins of "Līvu" can be traced back to 1972, when a vocal instrumental ensemble was formed in the Cultural House of Leuven, led by Juris Pavītols.
The ensemble in its original form participated in the "Lippie Gitar" festival in 1972 and 1974, as well as in city and republic shows.
In 1976, a chance meeting took place when Juris Pavitole met Erik Kigeli and formed a group at the Metallurgical Palace of Culture, inviting Ingrid Gutman, Andri Krzyzin and Jani Grodum to join.
Over the years, the group's composition has changed several times.
Members have joined, some have left, some have returned.
However, the main thing - the desire to prove that Latvian rock music is capable of living and existing - has remained unchanged.
"The boys were clearly different from the stereotypical stage actor in jeans, jeans and beards", says music critic Klaus Wauer.
In addition to the aforementioned musicians, the group included such outstanding musicians as Igo, Vilnis Russiņš, Modris Sterns, Valdis Stark, Laimis Racenāi, Taulis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brīze, Guntar Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomass Klein and many others.
Admission to the exhibition is free.
The exhibition runs from 19 August to 30 October.
On August 27, the "LIVEfest 2" will be held at the "Pūt, vētiniņi" concert hall in Leipzig to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the group "Līvi".
For the first time in eight months, Bulgaria is experiencing inflation.
In July, Bulgarian national statistics showed monthly inflation of 1%.
This is the highest figure since 2012 and the first above zero since October last year when it was positive (0.2%).
The Commission established the profitability of the sampled Union producers by expressing the pre-tax net profit of the sales of the like product to unrelated customers in the Union as a percentage of the turnover of those sales.
The Commission established the profitability of the Union industry by expressing the pre-tax net profit of the sales of the like product to unrelated customers in the Union as a percentage of the turnover of those sales.
The Commission also noted that the Union industry was facing a significantly higher level of injury than its competitors in the Union market.
Compared to the previous month, July 2016 saw an increase in prices for the following consumer goods groups: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); entertainment and cultural events (6.3%); hotels and restaurants (1.2%); household goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); household appliances, household appliances and regular household cleaning (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcohol and tobacco, household goods, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Zbigniew Stankevich: The time will come when the truth will be revealed.
In an interview with the Independent, Metropolitan Zbigniew Stankevich, archbishop of the Catholic Church in Latvia, emphasizes that if we want to find strength in life, the Gospel message must be at the center of it.
Because the power of truth is greater than the power of evil.
Many are already on their way to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Aglona.
What good news will believers there receive this year?
In recent years, the desire to conduct the main worship service in Aglon has been expressed by the papal nuncio.
Hence, the main message is in his mind.
The way of the Cross is also a tradition, led by Bishop John Bull.
He, too, will shape his message.
I'm conducting a Christmas Eve service the day before.
Last year, I turned to Pope Francis' encyclical Laudato si' and updated the common home it contains, the theme of the earth in the Latvian context.
This year, of course, I'm watching what's happening in the world, and I'm trying to respond to it in my talk.
My approach is in line with the church's recommendation that the gospel message be at the center of our lives.
The Gospel must be shown to answer the most painful problems of man's life and to inspire him to go on.
Then it speaks to people.
But in the Cesi, in the Lamp discussion, you said that "we have to go back to the concept of the whole person".
What do you mean?
Does this mean that a person is turning away from the message of the church?
And does the church today have a resource for such a return?
A dying man was robbed on the side of a road in India's capital.
In the Indian capital, no one has been alerted to the death of a man who was hit and killed on the side of the road, apparently lying on the side of the road for an hour before being robbed, reports the BBC.
A man identified as Mattibull was reported to have been riding a rickshaw during the day but working as a security guard at night.
Mattipool was driving home at 5:30 a.m. when he was hit by a light truck.
The surveillance footage shows the driver got out of the car to take a look at the victim and then drove away.
An hour later, no one knew about the bleeding man, and he was robbed by a mobster.
About 90 minutes after the crash, police arrived at the scene and the victim was taken to a hospital, where he died from his injuries.
By withdrawing her candidacy for the post of Director-General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), the head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Koļegova, saved the government from collapse, says Oyārs Skudra, associate professor at the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Latvia.
The explanation of the colleague for withdrawing her candidacy in the context of the disagreements in the ruling coalition is related to the fact that she prevented the fall of the government.
In an interview with LETA, Skudr said he could hardly imagine that Unity would support Kolegova's candidacy at the government meeting next week.
Therefore, if the Unity ministers vote against, but Kolegov is confirmed anyway, it will lead to the resignation of the government.
The expert also considers that before the announcement of the withdrawal of the candidacy, Kolegova consulted both the Minister of Finance Danu Reiznieci-Ozol and Prime Minister Marie Kuczynski.
At the same time, it is also a blow to Unity, which strongly opposed her candidacy.
In predicting whether the competition would lead to a suitable candidate, Mr Skudra recognised that there were two options: either a compromise figure would be chosen or the agency would continue to be run by Dace Pelék as acting Director-General.
At the same time, he points out that if the Finance Minister has so far claimed that no other candidate is being considered, it is a reason for the Grey House not to participate in the competition.
The LETA has already reported that the head of the State Environmental Service Kolegova has decided to withdraw her candidacy for the post of Director General of the VID.
Due to the objections of Unity, the government delayed the confirmation of Kolegov as Director General of the UNDP for a week on Tuesday.
Following the government's decision to postpone the decision, Kolegova confirmed that she was still willing to become the head of the UNO.
However, she later changed her mind, stating in a submission to Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola on Friday that she was withdrawing her consent to the transfer to the post of head of the IDA and that it was not an easy choice for her.
Andrei Vaivars, press secretary of Prime Minister Maria Kuczynska, told LETA that a new competition will be held for the vacant post of Director-General of the JHA.
There's been an accident in downtown Riga involving a police car.
In the center of Riga, there was a traffic accident this afternoon involving a State Police vehicle.
A police car with its sound and light signals on was speeding to the highest level of alert until it collided with another car at the intersection of Krishjan Barona and Dzirnava Street.
Police are investigating the circumstances of the incident, but initial reports indicate that the second gunshot did not hit the police car.
There's a woman in an accident.
This year, Riga's population has declined
At the beginning of this year, Riga had a population of 638 784, which is 0,34% less than in 2015, when the capital officially had 641 000 inhabitants, the Central Statistical Office (CSP) informed LETA.
In terms of population, the Latvian capital ranks 30th among the capitals of the European Union (EU) countries and large cities with a population of over one million.
According to Eurostat, the EU statistical office, Riga has the highest proportion of women - the Latvian capital is consistently in first place among Europe's largest cities with 127 women for every 100 men.
All three Baltic capitals have the highest proportion of women in Europe's major cities: 123 women for every 100 men in Vilnius and 121 women for every 100 men in Tallinn.
The LNMM shall be accompanied by warning icons.
In the coming days, warning signs - pictograms - will be posted at the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM), Baiba Gailīte, representative of the Riga City Property Department, told LETA.
The museum's glass panels have now been successfully repaired from damage caused by the skateboarder's activities.
In the coming days, warning icons will be placed on the site.
The residents will be told that the roof is often icy during rain and snow and that vehicles, bicycles, skis and roller coasters are not allowed.
Uchakov also wrote on Facebook at the time that the damage posed no security risks but "seemed unkempt" and that skateboarders "will be killed".
Parents and children - New playgrounds for children have been installed in Riga.
This summer, the municipality of Riga has installed two new playgrounds in the city, in Kipsalo and in Čiekurkalna, which are now available for children.
A large, multifunctional toy boat with various climbing elements, bridges, games, tubes and ice rinks is installed on Kippsala beach.
The playground is designed for children of all ages.
The field also has scaffolding and various balancing elements.
The attraction's location on the banks of the Danube River, overlooking the passenger harbor and the cruise ships, fills the imagination of small boaters.
The playground has a playhouse, a battlement, a stairway, a balance bridge, a shovel, a toy bomb and other play elements, as well as an exercise area with rings for strength and coordination training, a skateboard and other sports elements.
Rubber-covered floor in various colours.
A new, colorful, brick roof has been installed on the side of the street to the playground.
A reconstructed section of the road has been discovered in the media.
Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, the management of VAS Latvian State Roads (LVC), as well as the builder SIA "Binders" and representatives of the municipalities today unveiled the reconstructed section of the main state highway between the Russian border (Grebneva) and the Rezekne-Daugavpils-Lithuanian border (Medumi) (A13) from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163.05 km).
Roads are a national card, especially border roads, so it is a special pleasure to unveil the reconstructed section of the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the improvement in the situation on the main national highways thanks to the co-financing of the European Union funds.
"As forecast, the funds available for roads will be available in 2018 during this planning period, and we need to think about how to continue to maintain the most congested motorways in very good quality, and also ensure population mobility in all regions of Latvia without EU funding", Uldis Augulis stressed, cutting the symbolic ribbon.
The Minister also pointed out that the proposals prepared by the traffic experts on sustainable financing of Latvian roads will be presented to the Government in the near future.
The construction works on the section from Medum to the Lithuanian border (156,4-163,05 km) were started by SIA Binders last year and continued this year after a technological break.
The reconstruction cost is EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
'The road construction has been completely rebuilt during the reconstruction phase and the next stage from Medum to Daugavpils itself will be repaired next year, thus bringing the entire route from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpils to order,' said the Chairman of the LVC Board of Directors, Jānis Lange.
The national highways are the most congested and by 2018 we plan to have all the national highways in good condition.
The next step will be to maintain them in good condition by providing timely periodic maintenance and replacing the asphalt surface every 7-9 years.
'This will of course require adequate funding and all travellers are looking forward to the proposals developed by the expert group to streamline the road financing system,' Lange noted.
The project has provided road connections and lighting in the centre of Medumu.
Significant earthworks were carried out: extensive irrigation in four stages and extensive digging and dredging, and a leveling of the road's longitudinal profile, which had previously been very uneven.
The public transport terminals have also been renovated and a new public transport turn-off has been built.
The road was previously poorly maintained and the surrounding terrain was opaque due to the mountainous valleys and the general relief of the old road.
The construction phase of the motorway from the city of Daugavpils to the reconstructed phase (144.80-156.40 km) is planned to be renewed in the next construction season.
The LVC plans to carry out various works on more than 1100 kilometres of national road this year.
The Commission notes that the measures in question are compatible with the internal market.
"The right combination of foods is essential to achieve the desired weight loss results", admits Lithuanian nutritionist Laura Romeraite-Kucleeriene.
And it is easy to do this during the summer when our own gardens produce fresh fruits, fruits, and vegetables.
A well-thought-out combination of dietary products can not only help to reduce excess weight but also to promote various bodily processes in a targeted manner.
Macaroni and aetica are a successful combination because they provide a lasting home feeling and help fight fat.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that ethics have a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and help us feel better.
Cayenne peppers and high-protein foods, such as poultry or a protein shake, not only make you feel at home but also reduce the craving for large meals at subsequent meals.
Combining these foods can also increase calorie burn after a meal by up to 35 percent.
Studies show that cayenne pepper can help you lose fat around your belly.
Eggs contain the metabolic nutrient choline, and peppers are a good source of vitamin C.
Taking adequate amounts of these nutrients can reduce cortisol levels and, with it, fat accumulation around the midsection of the body.
Another hearty, fat-burning breakfast dish to include in your menu is the oatmeal pudding with fresh berries.
Oats and berries contain fiber, which Canadian scientists have found controls ghrelin, an appetite-stimulating hormone, and thus hunger.
In addition, berries contain polyphenols that help to reduce weight and prevent fat buildup.
Vegetables and protein can also work wonders for weight loss.
This combination can create a homey feel.
The gardens contain water and fiber, so they make for a homey feel.
At the same time, protein slows down digestion and makes you feel at home for longer.
For lunch, you can have a salad steak or a protein shake with your favorite vegetables.
What product combinations to avoid.
Fruits contain sugars - either monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
In contrast, starch found in vegetables is a polysaccharide.
The fruit is broken down mechanically in the yolk, but it does not break down chemically until it reaches the third or fourth stage of digestion in the intestines.
The process of fermentation is divided into three distinct stages, beginning in the mouth.
It is therefore important not to eat solid food immediately after a meal.
When you eat solid food immediately after a meal, it is "squeezed" into a pan with other foods where it is not chemically digested and begins to bloat.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, beans, bananas, dates, or other carbohydrate-containing products with lemons, apples, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples, or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme pthyaline, which is found in turnips, only works in a alkaline environment.
Fruit acids not only inhibit the digestion of carbohydrates but also promote their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or combination of nuts and milk and similar protein-rich products at one meal.
They require different digestive juices, each with different strengths, characteristics and time to digest.
Watermelons, honey melons, muskmelons and other melons should always be eaten separately from other foods.
Melons are not pickled when they are in a jar with other foodstuffs.
Fats in combination with protein-rich products.
Fat works well with starch, but not so with fat and protein - fat slows down protein digestion.
Protein can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If you eat a lot of protein, avoid fat altogether.
This also applies to freshness - it is not recommended to combine a large amount of nuts (high in protein) with a healthy avocado (high in fat).
This combination inhibits effective weight loss.
What's the best way to cook?
"Cooking, heat treatment, and so on cause significant nutrient losses - about 15 to 55 percent of the original nutrient content of the food", says a nutritionist.
Most nutrients are lost when food is boiled in water.
However, the nutritional value of some foods increases when cooked directly.
The liquid left over from cooking vegetables is recommended for use in soups, so that you will not lose the nutrients left in the water and can eat them later.
It is recommended that vegetables be prepared by steaming.
Heat treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene in tomatoes.
Eating tomatoes for 30 minutes increases lycopene levels by 25%.
Heat treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of beta-carotene, which is found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, cashews, sweet potatoes and spinach.
Heat treatment of eggs and meat takes away the natural characteristics of the protein they contain, making them more easily digestible.
Heat treatment of meat and eggs also facilitates the absorption of iron and other minerals in these products.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing products can reduce vitamin C levels by 10% to 90%, but freezing the fibre does not.
When beans are combined with tomatoes, they can increase iron absorption in the body, which in turn improves brain and muscle function.
Our bodies absorb up to 33 percent less non-blood iron from plant products like beans, leafy greens, grains than from blood-forming iron from animal products like beef, fish and oats.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-blood-forming iron from your body by taking non-blood-forming iron products in your diet along with sources of vitamin C such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to convert non-blood iron into iron that is more easily absorbed by the body.
Iron is needed to produce hemoglobin, which carries oxygen to the muscles and brain.
To get the most out of your salads, add healthy fats, such as olive or flaxseed oil.
When making buttermilk, add vitamin D-rich buttermilk or sardines to unsweetened yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the intestines and plays a vital role in bone formation.
Eggs (as well as other whole grains) along with sources of vitamin C, such as peas, currants, oats, and other fruits or berries, help stabilize cholesterol levels and prevent hardening of the arteries.
Snapchat's anime effect criticized for caricaturing Asians
Snapchat officials say the filter was inspired by the animation, but some commentators claim it is racist and insensitive.
With this lens effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users every day to manipulate reality and play with their identities in absurd ways.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that fits in a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
The lenses are blurry, image-distorting devices that generate more than 30 million transformed selfies a day.
Any mistake quickly becomes public knowledge.
Snapchat's lens effects have previously been criticized for popularizing too dark skin or light facial skin tones as the ideal beauty benchmark.
New lens effects were released this week that allow users to create curly eyes, curly teeth and round faces, and some critics have dubbed it a racist Asian cartoon   yellow genie.
It was also asked whether such contradictions did not indicate that the company had greater diversity problems.
News and public denial erupted on Wednesday when The Verge and Motherboard announced that the lens effects had been removed from the app.
The company explained that the lens is intended to portray Anime characters, not caricatures of people of Asian descent.
But for people who have experienced racism, these effects were reminiscent of painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied the similarity to Anime.
A Twitter post about the images by Korean-American art student Grace Sparpani received widespread response, in which she said the lens effects were "injury and inconvenience, to say the least".
She added that it is difficult not to notice the obvious similarity between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
So what this shows is that the lens effect is not just yellowface, but yellowface in terms of racism.
Snapchat isn't the only company that's fallen into these cultural patterns.
American culture is also engaged in a relentless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood to the devices we use every day.
And Snapchat's large, multi-racial youth audience, unlike older people, is more sensitive to these things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, "these things don't go unnoticed these days", said 25-year-old Katie Zhou in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhou, the product manager of Medium, deleted his Snapchat app and urged others to do the same.
In her article Medium and in a telephone interview, she explained that, in her opinion, the problems with race are caused by Snapchat's employment policies, which do not sufficiently support racial diversity.
Jow criticized the company's management, which is mostly white men, and then ended her post with the #DeleteSnapchat reference.
"It means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so these decisions are allowed", says Zhou, a Chinese-American who says that "there are some people of other races in the company who do not take a position where they can express themselves in a safe and comfortable way".
Her opinion is shared by others, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose the number of employees representing different races, stating that it is a private company.
Snapchat declined to discuss the origins of its employees, but a representative revealed that the company has hired a human resources specialist to focus on ensuring that underrepresented racial minorities are represented and promote inclusion.
Joe, on the other hand, refuses to update his Snapchat account, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to realize that this is wrong".
The House of Representatives has announced that military officials have falsified reports about the Islamic State.
In a statement issued Thursday, the House of Representatives said that U.S. Central Command officials distorted reports to portray the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as far more optimistic than it actually is.
Central Intelligence Agency analysts expressed general dissatisfaction with the interim report of the task force, which was formed by Republican representatives of the Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Finance Subcommittee, indicating that their leadership controlled reports on American progress against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida, that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news on this report is that intelligence reports, confirmed by senior Centcom officials, portray the U.S. fight against terrorism as more positive than it actually is.
California Republican Representative Ken Calvert said: "The Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers are the ones who suffer when our policymakers get false information".
The Central Committee's management mistakes are sought at the highest levels of the organisation.
This 10-page report details the problems in Central Command's reporting and analysis of US efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide conclusive evidence that senior Obama administration officials were involved in the reporting tampering, it does show that the Centcom leadership has put some pressure on analysts to portray a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report states that in the first half of 2015, the Central Administration's press releases, announcements and reports to Congress portrayed the situation in a significantly more positive light than it actually was.
For example, Centcom publicly announced that the Mosul operation could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq's second largest city, still under Islamic State control.
"A months-long investigation clearly shows this", states Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, in his report.
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, senior U.S. Central Administration officials distorted reports to portray the ISIS threat in Iraq as weaker than it actually was.
The Republican Party set up a task force after learning that analysts were concerned that information about the Islamic State was being tampered with.
As the investigation continues, a report published Thursday will lead to new findings in the case.
The Ministry of Defence Inspectorate-General is investigating the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency.
The Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their own report Thursday, agreeing with some of the findings of the Republican task force.
In his report, Representative Adams B. Schiff, a Democrat, reports that from 2014 to 2015, Centcom over-restricted intelligence assessment reports related to ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr. Schiff explains that this process "has stopped the spread of information", has degraded the ethics of analysts, and has "spread untrue facts".
But Schiff and Democrats added that there was no evidence that the White House pressured Centcom analysts to produce reports in accordance with "pre-determined or political positions".
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the congressional investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's Inspector General had launched an investigation into complaints from Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans said the Pentagon would not comment on the congressional report while the investigation continues.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data differently, and the Ministry of Defence and the Intelligence Community called for constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the success of the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria (an opinion increasingly expressed by the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's indictments cast doubt on whether President Obama can fully rely on the Central Administration's reports on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot spots.
Criticism of Islamic State spying is reminiscent of events more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study claiming that the George W. Bush administration launched the war in Afghanistan with too little thought for its possible consequences.
Hooker also played a key role in uncovering the Islamic State spy ring.
Last year, officials reported that Hooker's team had discovered that contrary to public reports, airstrikes on the Islamic State oil facilities had not significantly worsened the financial position of the terrorist group, as they had built makeshift factories to sell oil on the black market.
The September edition of The Times reported that the discovery did not occur outside the confines of the Central Administration.
The commander of Centcom at the time, General Lloyd Austin III, received sharp criticism because many lawmakers felt that war reports portrayed the situation too positively.
In April, General Austin retired and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
In the U.S. women's field hockey match against Great Britain, the U.S. wins, thus claiming its fourth consecutive victory.
A day after a 6-1 win over Japan, on Thursday, Keiti Bama scored her first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team as the Americans beat India 3-0.
Five goals in two games is a memorable achievement, but Bama, 27, said that she could not remember if she had ever done anything like that before.
She said, "I have no idea".
I'm not the kind of person who counts the number of doors they get.
But she knows that the Americans are 4-0 in the Olympics, which puts them in a tie with Great Britain, who went undefeated on Thursday after beating Japan 2-0.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday for the final match of the first round of the games.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will only determine which team will finish first in the six-team group and which second.
The first-place winner will avoid a strong Dutch opponent, the leader of the second group, for a little longer.
Despite Saturday's game, the Americans have already caused a storm of surprise by finishing last out of 12 teams in London four years ago.
Bama was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, took up field hockey at age 3 (her older twin sister was already playing the sport in Drexel) and joined the national team at age 16, becoming the youngest player in the team's history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she didn't make the finals.
But 2012 was a bad year for her and her team.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parham was appointed as the national team coach, and things changed for the better.
Bama called it "a cultural, mental, and physical change".
We never invested as much in London as we do now.
We've changed everything completely.
In the fourth game, Bama revealed the score by scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close range.
India started the match unbeaten, but their score was very clean and kept the score low at 0-1 until the end of the third period when Bama scored again.
She put the ball in the opponent's zone on the left side of the court, then managed to get to the center of the court and shoot the ball into the opponent's goal, leading the Americans 2-0.
In the middle of the fourth quarter, Melissa Gonzalez scored another goal.
This was the first dry game for U.S. goalie Jackie Briggs, with one goal in each of his first three games.
She's in the middle of something.
And so is Bama.
"We're doing very well now", said Paham, but how well we're doing will be shown by the game on Saturday.
The most depressing meal of the Depression is the "Saturated Meal".
In March 1933, shortly after being elected president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office to hold a luncheon.
President Roosevelt enjoyed fine culinary delicacies such as foie gras and Maryland crab soup.
But this time his meal was much more modest: a stuffed egg in a tomato sauce, a potato mash, and a plum pudding for dessert.
Says Jane Ziegelman: "It's a way of showing solidarity by cooking for people who are having a hard time".
Her husband, Andrew Couch, adds: "It's also a message to Americans about how to eat".
A couple from Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Kou's latest book, "The Garden Party", describes Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's book, "97 Apples", describes life through food in a rented house on the lower east side of Manhattan.
Their new collaborative work, "Saturated Dinner", to be published Tuesday by Harper's, is a story about American food during the Great Depression.
In a show of solidarity in the culinary world, they held luncheons together at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a simple dining establishment in the Flatiron district that has been in operation since 1929, when the Great Depression began.
Mrs. Ziegelman, 54, ordered butter bread with grated cheese and chopped olives, and Mr. Kou, 57, ordered turkey, potato chips and vegetable salads.
When the reporter ordered the fake rabbit, the couple recognized that his choice was very appropriate for a conversation about food during the Great Depression.
Mrs. Siegelman said that the fake rabbit was very popular.
There was a peanut butter, a liver butter and a peanut butter.
They were made from the basic ingredient and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to replace your lunch.
Mr. Kou is not getting up.
"It just seemed to be full of lead", he added.
In the years before the Depression, the American lunch table was similar to the Swedish one, especially in rural areas.
The women prepared meals for their husbands, and freshly made sausages were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
During World War I, Americans were the ones who sent food to Europe. "The Satisfied Meal" describes how Americans adjusted to the fact that America was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
"Food became the center of the American public's daily attention", says Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
New budget diets became equally important: unknown foods like fake ham and sausages became commonplace, and sausages were "a great way to use up leftovers", noted Mrs. Ziegelman, because cooks could hide unattractive ingredients under a creamy scale.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.
Meat, which for years was a staple of American meals, has now become an extremely rare luxury commodity.
In an era when calories and nutrition were more important than taste, new, unprecedented formations sprang up.
In an old handbook, Mrs. Ziegelman found recipes for making peanut butter-filled onions.
"It was not a popular lunch item", says Mr. Kou.
"It was surreal", says Mrs. Siegelman.
Peanut butter and baked onions are not compatible.
Many homemade recipes are appropriate for difficult times.
Household economists like Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Household Economics Office from 1923 to 1943, defined national eating habits that had not been experienced before or since the Great Depression.
Publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged households to become "economists" and to accept such challenges as turning pasta and porridge into a tasty meal.
The Maltese is a historic delicacy.
Of particular interest are the government's attitudes toward its starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
Although he publicly spoke of his humble childhood and eating in Iowa, he actually ate like the smart millionaire he had become.
"He enjoyed European cuisine", says Mr. Kou, "like fish and pickle soup".
He ate in a nearly frozen dining room, wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely cut off from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to set an example by his eating habits.
The book says that Roosevelt hired a maid who could not cook, and the White House became "not only the site of one of the most delicious meals in Washington, D.C., but also the site of the worst cooking".
As the nation's economy recovered, most of the great Depression-era culinary traditions disappeared.
But we continue to focus on calories and nutrition, and on how to apply science to cooking", added Mrs. Ziegelman.
The couple said that writing the book helped them to understand more about Mrs. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as why she could not throw out food.
"She was really afraid to throw out the food", said Mr. Kou.
Mrs. Siegelman said, "She really upset people".
There was an incident with the windmill.
While we were eating in Eisenberg's dining room, a couple of writers pulled out a homemade dessert from their bag: the plum pudding that President Roosevelt used to eat for lunch.
"It's a feather powder", said Mrs. Ziegelman, adding that it was common practice at the time to name a modest meal a chicken.
It's not powdered, just dried plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone was eager to soak the carrots in the brown mass on the branches.
Surprisingly, it wasn't that bad.
Mr. Kou ate some more of the cummings.
Hearing from an experienced "economist", he told his wife: "I could use a pinch of the enamel stick nuts".
Gilead will be reimbursed for legal fees in the fight with Merck over the hepatitis C patent.
The district court has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to recover the costs of legal services it has paid in the Hepatitis C patent infringement case against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June Gilead was acquitted of a 200 million mark fine for infringing two Merck patents it held in connection with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni pills when a U.S. federal judge found wrongdoing in Merck's operations, such as lying after taking an oath and other unethical activities.
At the hearing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Betsy Labson Freeman stated that Gilead is entitled to recover the legal costs of its defense in this case.
Merck is trying to gain market share against Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that are 90 percent effective in liver disease.
The case was initiated back in 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other to seek ownership of the newly developed active ingredient sofosbuvir, the main ingredient in Gilead.
The US-backed forces claim to have fully taken control of the city of Manbij from the Islamic State.
US-backed forces have taken full control of the northern city of Manbij on the Turkish border and the last Islamic State fighters have left the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are currently clearing the city of the last remaining enemy fighters who have not yet left.
They have freed more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF-affiliated Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now under our full control and we are searching for the fighters", he told Reuters.
The Clintons' income in 2015 was $10.75 million, and the couple paid a 34.2% federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, showing that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband have earned $10.75 million this year and paid a 34.2 percent federal income tax rate.
During 2015, Clinton has donated $1 million, mostly to her Clinton charity, while former President Bill Clinton has earned about $5.3 million from speaking engagements and the former Secretary of State has earned $3 million from her book on working at the State Department, published in association with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Keynes of Virginia, and his wife, Anna Holtone, have released their tax returns for the past 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Keynes continue to set new standards for financial transparency", said Clinton's campaign partner Jennifer Palmer in a statement.
Instead, Donald Trump hides behind a variety of ruses and ruses to avoid fulfilling promises to disclose his tax information.
Public disclosure of tax information is a record practice for U.S. presidential candidates, but is not required by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers cite an IRS audit as a reason not to release tax information.
"Your Walk", a tweet from Clinton's campaign partner Ian Sam, shared the Democratic nominee's tax information.
On Thursday, Trump's special adviser Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release tax information until the audit was complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, claim that his refusal raises questions about his true assets, donations and other business dealings, including ties to Russia.
Clinton added fuel to the fire Friday by posting a video of several powerful Republicans demanding Trump release his tax information.
She came back to this question again at the economic conference in Michigan on Thursday.
She announced the effort: "He refuses to do what other presidential candidates have done for decades".
Politico reports that for two years in the 1990s, Trump paid very little or no taxes, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday reported that many accountants and lawyers believe nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are a major issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, backed by billionaire Warren Buffett, is promoting the idea that anyone earning more than $1 million a year should pay at least 30% in taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports this proposal.
During Clinton's speech last week in Omaha, Nebraska, home to his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, Buffett urged Trump to exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he's also under IRS audit and Trump is afraid of voters, not the IRS.
The Clinton campaign has published tax information going back to 2007.
Now, the Clintons live in Chappaqua, New York, and between 2007 and 2014, they paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent and a total tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
Clinton's 2015 tax returns show that unlike most Americans, only $100 of her income is a salary.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which Clinton has received $109,000 in dividends.

Jewish filmmaker criticizes hotel in Berlin for unlocking Israeli satellite code at Arab request - RT News
A French-Jewish filmmaker has stirred up a social media storm after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have an Israeli telephone code, citing Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, director of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, has made no secret of his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin and has written an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During a recent visit, Lancman tried to find the Israeli satellite codes in the hotel's list.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries to which direct calls from a hotel room are permitted.
How is it possible that in the year 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel is trapped and destroyed?
It's from Lancman.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol Hotel offers to call this country through its call centre.
The director demanded an explanation from the hotel staff.
The answer, Lanzmann wrote, "shocked them".
The hotel manager explained that "it was a conscious decision by the hotel management".
The reason for the code's removal made the filmmaker even more annoyed.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they demanded the erasure of the Israeli code", Lancman quotes a hotel employee as saying.
The Suddeutsche Zeitung reports that Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case "a great shame".
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
That in itself is a great shame.
And the fact that this happened in Germany, in this very hotel chain, is an even bigger humiliation.
No need to explain.
The official stated: 'We hope the hotel will draw the right conclusions.'
The incident also received a fairly wide response on the Internet, where people branded it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski Hotel was simply catering to Arab customers.
Another message read "shame on you", stating that the hotel was located on Kurfurstendamm Street next to the synagogue.
Der Spiegel reports that the hotel itself quickly rejected all allegations, saying it was a "misunderstanding" and apologizing to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of countries", the Suddeutsche Zeitung quotes Kempinski as saying.
He adds that the code is again added to the list.
Police use rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting students in Brazil.
A student-police clash took place in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, where students were demonstrating against government education reforms.
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas against the students.
The problem began when law enforcement officers tried to rescue the students, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their displeasure with the reform of the education system.
The proposal by São Paulo governor Geraldo Alckmin calls for the closure of nearly 100 public schools and the transfer of 300,000 students to other schools in order to save money.
Some protesters graffitied the walls with messages against interim president Michael Temer.
The protest came just days after the previous one, when students gathered to demonstrate in support of ousted President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached by the Senate.
Scott Kelum Skinner finishes first, bringing Britain the gold medal in cycling
Kelum Skinner of Scotland finished first in the men's team sprint at the Rio Velodrome last night as the British team defended their title they won at the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow played a key role in the race, making the Scottish legend Sir Chris Howe proud and taking the victory to the favourites New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won a surprise victory when Hoye won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated that at the World Championships in London, even though Hoye had already finished his athletic career.
The problem was the stage between the Beijing and London Olympics, as experienced sprint specialist Jamie Staff had to be replaced.
They got it at the last minute.
When Hoye left, Kian Emady and Matt Crampton tried to fill his place.
The British coach placed high hopes on Skinner, seeing in him potential, which he later proved.
The Indians, Kenya, the champions, who started four years ago with Hoyu and Skinner, who set an Olympic qualifying record, but the best start to the race was by the New Zealand team.
However, the British trio won the gold medal.
The Indians were in a tight race, and Kenny was in the lead, and Skinner was in the lead.
The change in strategy was crucial to the victory, as the Indians drove with more gear to allow Kenya and especially Skinner to go faster.
Hoye was watching the race as a BBC spokesman and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenya and Hinds as they ascended the podium.
The 23-year-old gardener said: "It was an amazing honor".
I'm doing everything I can to defend my name.
In the final, we set an Olympic record and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better victory.
After winning the 2012 London Olympics with Kenya and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later refuted this comment and the British competitors were unable to prove otherwise.
This time, there was no such incident.
"The British flags in the stands were a reminder of London", said Hinds.
In the last three months, we've become a tight-knit team.
We've lost so many World Championships, that's why winning the Olympics was really special.
One medal will go to the country that won seven of the ten gold medals in cycling in Beijing and London.
If this is an indicator of the team's progress over the past five months, then the next five days are going to be very exciting.
Given Kenya's performance, he could really repeat Hoya's success, winning three Olympic gold medals.
In addition, Kenny was born on 23 March (apparently a British holy day, as Steve Regrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born on this date).
This is also the date that Hoyt was born.
Kenya's next race is a sprint that starts today and continues for the next three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying it now.
A team trip is always the best.
Because then you can win with your teammates.
Honestly, it's a little lonely to win alone".
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be promoted to the rank of field marshal".
It was the only medal fight that day, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steve Burke and Owen Doole set the fastest qualifying time for the four-kilometre fours.
His time was 3:51.943.
The world record, set in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final will be held later today, with Wiggin sure to be the center of attention.
Yesterday before qualifying, he had a run-in with the police when the judges called him in to measure his height.
In the women's race, which continues and ends today, Laura Trout, Joan Rovsel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milnavi set a new course record time of 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes the British cycling team will hopefully win a medal in the Olympic half marathon.
Recalling the outstanding and unprecedented performances in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same in Rio.
Meanwhile, behind the scenes, there's been a lot of action, with accusations of sexism and defamation, the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton, and the end of career for Hoyt and Victoria Bendleton.
But as the first cycling races begin, it looks as if Britain will reach its peak, as it always does, in time.
The future of Portland's smelter is becoming unclear as a major contract is terminated.
The future of the aluminum smelter and its hundreds of employees in Portland, Victoria, is in doubt as its main customer, the energy company, announces it has terminated its partnership.
The basis for this notification is the Victorian Government's plans to end the subsidies to the energy company, which are vital to the company's continued operation.
The 20-year-old subsidies will be terminated in November.
As a result, more than 2,000 Alcoa Portland plant jobs are at risk.
Up to 2000 jobs, both direct and indirect, could be at risk.
In addition, it will have unforeseen side effects, since the smelter consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's electricity.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power station.
Alcoa's Portland distillery is running at a loss and could be shutting down.
These developments were prompted by years of speculation about the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of production at the factory.
The power supplier of the plant AGL, which supplies power from its Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley, says that the other three owners will likely also terminate their contracts.
The majority of the power plants are owned by the Alcoa and Alumia joint ventures, and in addition to the company's shares, the holding companies CITIC in China and Marubeni Corp in Japan also own the company.
AGL looks forward to the continuation of the Portland plant, which would mean further energy supply to the smelter,' said its representative.
AGL announced that the contracts are so-called 'risk-mitigating contracts' which are expected to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a validity period of 12 months and will therefore be valid until 2017.
AGL plans to continue to receive revenues from these contracts in fiscal year 2017,' said the company representative.
The potential impact on profits from FY2018 is limited by the favourable market outlook for future wholesale electricity prices.
AGL claims that it has already calculated losses of USD 187 million in its forecasts, assuming that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa states that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa's ability to continue operating the smelter or supply it with energy.
The US company reports that it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, but that it will be terminated in November.
Analysts have expressed concern about the possible closure of both the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the industry's weak economy.
AGL's CEO, Steven Mickelson, said last week that analysts estimated that Portland uses 600 megawatts of power per year and Tomago 900 megawatts.
If both plants were to exit the energy market, the demand for energy would be significantly reduced.
And that would be very bad.
The Community Legal Centre rejects 160 000 people every year.
More than 160 000 claims are rejected each year, and budget cuts could make things worse.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without the means to fight illegal harassment - are denied free legal aid and representation.
The Community Legal Centre, already overwhelmed, warns that the reduction in funding will only make matters worse.
As of June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than before.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Legal Centre, said that a recent report by the National Association of Legal Centres shows that thousands of people in need of legal aid are currently being denied it.
Mr Farrell pointed out that if the decision was not reversed, the situation would only get worse.
He adds: "The Queensland Legal Centre is constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people who need it are denied help".
People who are trying to end abusive relationships, people with deep debts, families experiencing divorce, workers who are wrongfully dismissed - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
From June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent, meaning that thousands more Queenslanders will have to deal with their complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Senator George Brands of Queensland to immediately halt the funding cuts so that people in need of legal aid can get it.
Last year, the government unveiled its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to focus on the needs of the local community and their customers and for the Palazchuk government to invest in this important area.
Donald Trump's campaign is being sued for employee pulling a gun.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign organizers are facing charges for failing to act on a tip that their North Carolina operations manager was turning a gun on an employee while they were driving together in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Charlotte Court by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign programmer.
Bordini said he's been waiting for months for an internal review of this case to begin, but realized it wasn't going to happen.
The driver, Earl Philip, "pulls out a gun, puts his right index finger on the barrel and turns his head against Vincent's knee", Bordini claims in his complaint.
He also claims that when he complained to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same thing.
"Weapons do not have to be fired to cause damage", Bordini wrote in his complaint.
Just two days before the case was filed, the Republican presidential nominee caused a scandal by telling people that "People of the Other Revolution", gun owners and enthusiasts, could act if his running mate Hillary Clinton and her elected judges won the election.
Trump campaign officials said the media had taken his words out of context and he never incited anyone to violence.
Bordini's claim is for compensation from the campaign for negligent oversight, but from Phillips for assault, illegal weapon use and emotional distress.
Trump spokesman Houpa Hicks declined to comment immediately.
I haven't been able to get ahold of Phillips.
WCCB - Charlotte's local news agency reports that Philip recently dropped out of the campaign.
Nor was it possible to contact his consultancy firm, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial election campaign.
The Commission has also received information from the United States that the alleged violations of the arms embargo are not covered by the arms embargo.
New tradition - village and sports festivals in Kulcim.
On Saturday, people gathered for the first time in the village of Kullytsky for village festivals and sports.
After ten years of celebration, it was decided that the Festival of Ezra would not be held again.
The new page is now being cut.
The day began with a sporting event.
This time the competition was not traditional and was not taken too seriously, for example, the shotgun had to be thrown at a sleeping target, the shoe was flying, the human left hand was throwing, the "ball" was not at all in any of the Olympic Games.
Yet, each participant could show how strong, courageous, agile, and approachable he was.
After the games, the people gathered at the Freedom Stadium, where the town's festivities began.
At that time, there were also "baby-kitchens" where children could indulge in inflatable toys and get a new face in the makeup room.
A tradition that could have been followed was a parade of motorcycles and tractors.
The head of the district administration of Kuulciema, Inga Kadioke-Skadin, spoke to the audience, who wanted a nice rest and dry weather, but the rain was still pouring, but it did not disturb much.
The celebration continued with a greeting to the newest residents of the island.
It's really good that the guest has five girls and one boy.
Amateur artists from the Engures district came to the town with their performances - the audience enjoyed the performances of the senior dance group "Rudens rytmi", the performances of the various national dance performers "Redas" and the youth dancers "Golden Pearls".
And it's no wonder she happened to slip on a wet stage.
Of course, the locals and guests were delighted by the famous actor duo of Janis Jaran and Dainis Porgants, who were again Mildinis Nabin and Clear Kraniņa, as well as the attractive wife of Berezciem from the fishing village "Dieniņas".
The dance was performed by the band "Bruges".
Britain must keep the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only promote prosperity and growth in the local areas and in London, but also across the country.
This, I think, makes Heathrow very attractive, just like in London in 2012, where we invested a huge amount of work to make sure that all the regions of the country were the beneficiaries of the Olympic Games.
Stratford and Eastend got a tremendous amount from the Olympics.
And we will do it again by providing local residents and businesses with business opportunities near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new business opportunities, 40,000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment in the Heathrow area.
As with the London 2012 Olympics, there will be those who think that the challenge is too great and that the expansion of Heathrow is too ambitious.
At the time, people said that Britain would never make it to the Olympics on time and that it would be a worldwide failure.
The skeptics were wrong about 2012, and they won't be right about Heathrow either.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that will benefit the whole of society, not individual citizens.
The expansion has the potential to create up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating the ground for both employment and experience at this airport and across the UK.
The airport has a great team that has developed an infrastructure investment programme worth 11 billion DM, on time and within budget, starting with Terminal 5, which has been named the best airport terminal in the world for five years in a row, and finally Terminal 2, which is built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now they are ready to build a third runway, which will be financed by private investment of 16 billion marks.
The London 2012 Olympics were a great success, and I'm sure the expansion of Heathrow will be as well.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a new employment environment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton is a member of Heathrow's board of directors and former secretary of the Treasury Department's commercial bank.
In Switzerland, a woman runs off the highway to try to kill herself.
They fell on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are trying to locate witnesses to the accident when she was hit by several cars on the highway early Thursday morning.
The accident occurred shortly after midnight on Thursday on the A1 road near the town of Morges in the canton of Vaud.
A report by the police in the canton of Vaud said that, in a desperate attempt to commit suicide, the woman had been lurking on a dark road where she was hit by several cars.
The victim, a 49-year-old Swiss man, was killed in a suspicious suicide attempt when he crashed several cars, including a heavy truck.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers have already testified, but others have yet to be identified, police said, urging comments from drivers and witnesses.
A criminal investigation has also been opened, which is a logical step in this case, said lawyer Gilles Hofsteller to Le Tribune de Genève.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be fined.
Could the collision have been avoided?
Hofsteller adds: "The prosecutor will find out".
Two similar incidents in the last five years suggest that none of the drivers will be held accountable.
In both cases, the pedestrian had left the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not anticipate the presence of a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of negligent homicide after she hit a man sleeping on the A1 near Pietermaritzburg in August 2014.
The court found that the 22-year-old victim had been drinking and was later found asleep in the road.
The court found that the officer driving to the scene of the accident was driving appropriately and the judge recognized that the man sleeping on the road was "a completely unforeseen and extraordinary incident".
Anyone with information about Thursday's accident near Morges is invited to contact the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Collect signatures online for the call for the new Head of the EEAS.
The petition portal Avaaz.org has started collecting signatures for the competition for the post of new head of the State Revenue Service (SRS).
The petition, addressed to the ministers of the National Alliance (NA) and the Union of Greens and Farmers (UGF), states that society wants a transparent and professional process for nominating officials.
The petition was created on August 10 and has so far been signed by 55 people.
The nomination process for Ingas Kolegova as candidate for the post of Director-General of the JHA is opaque and unprofessional.
It recalls the best traditions of the Soviet Union's officials.
It discredits government and once again undermines public confidence in government and politics.
'We need a competition with clear criteria against which all candidates must be evaluated,' the petition says.
Its author, Janis B., pointed out that the public did not know the criteria for the selection of Kolegova.
It is also unclear what the candidate's intentions are for the job at the OLAF.
The petition calls on the State Chancellery to launch a new open competition, actively engaging professional candidates, recruiting recruitment specialists and offering appropriate remuneration.
Finance Minister Dana Reiznieces-Ozola officially nominated Kolegov for the post of head of the UID last week, and this week the government was supposed to confirm him for the new position, but all the Unity ministers voted against, so the matter was postponed for a week.
If we lose, I'm playing badly.
The volleyball players Aleksandr Samoilov and Yanniš Šmēdiņš hoped to win a medal at the Rio Olympics, but they did not get there.
One of the world's strongest beach volleyball pairs lost 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) in the final and deciding game of Thursday's sub-group tournament to Brazil's Evandro Gonçalves Oliveira and Pedro Solberg Salgado, ending their participation in the most important sporting forum in four years.
In the three subgroup matches, Latvian athletes won one match, but the same ratio was achieved by two other couples.
The three pairs of small points were then counted, which after the convincing loss in this match was the most unfavorable for the Latvian duo.
"We were in the lead in the first set, but at 16:15 we were still 16 points behind", Smidinysh recalled.
I don't even know how we missed the rest of the set.
That's not how you play.
Then the second set was fine, and the end of the set was a game-changer, and it needed to be a good basis for the third set.
We started out similar, but after we switched sides, we grew to just one team.
We made too many mistakes in the attack.
In the group stage, all teams were equal, with almost all games having three sets, so the points were small.
"We needed to play more evenly, not give up three or four points in a row", said the athlete.
We knew Evander could be hired.
"In the first set we finished it, in the second we scored 1-2 points, but in the third at +4 he already lost the game", Smidinysh recalled.
We tried to put on a good show.
Sometimes it was, sometimes it wasn't.
We didn't look at the scoreboard before the game, but we knew we needed as many points as possible.
"If we lose, I've played badly", Samoilov said.
Evander was expected to serve well and he did pretty well in the first set, but in the third set he opened the serve and it was difficult to build up an attack.
I made many mistakes in the reception, but I had to deal with them.
Samoilov said that unlike the previous match, the athletes were not nervous today.
"We walked, played, and defended, but we needed better serve", said the athlete.
"They played well and eventually got to the hole".
We said before the tournament that the lottery was the most difficult thing that could happen.
We had a chance to fight for first place, but we didn't even get out of the group.
"We all expected a medal and we expected a medal from ourselves, but after that there is no difference - 25th or fourth", said Samoilov, who predicted that the duo would continue to play together in the future.
I thought it was okay to keep playing together because this is just one tournament.
Samoilov was in his third Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, having started with Martin Plevinic in Beijing in 2008, but four years ago in London he played with Ruslan Sorokin.
Meanwhile, this was Schmidt's second start at the Olympics.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the Latvian authorities on the measures in question.
The State Energy Company "Latvenergo" is following the process of opening up the gas market from both the consumer and the potential seller's positions, said the company's press secretary Ivita Bidere.
'The decision whether to join the gas market as a trader in the future will be determined by the gas market model and legal framework.'
'We are therefore actively involved in the development and commentary of legislation and in making our own proposals,' said Bidere.
The BNS has already written that the Ministry of Economy (ME) in cooperation with the Public Service Regulatory Commission and the energy company Latvijas Gaze has developed a draft Cabinet Regulation on the 'Regulations on the trading and use of natural gas' which will change the principles of the operation of the existing natural gas market, ensuring that natural gas users have the right to choose freely their natural gas trader as of 3 April 2017.
In working towards a new regulation of the natural gas market, the EU aims to make the process of trading in natural gas as simple and user-friendly as possible.
The most efficient and user-friendly service solution is therefore the 'merchant-centric model', where all customer service activities are provided by the merchant - one contract, one invoice and one information and customer service point - leaving the technical aspects of the distribution system to the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in the electricity market.
It is recalled that the market for households is to be opened gradually, and that after 3 April 2017 households that do not wish to switch to another natural gas trader will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming connected users.
'In this case, the obligation to supply gas to connected users at a regulated price is imposed on the public tenderer,' the ministry said.
Traders will have to choose a natural gas trader with whom to conclude a natural gas trading contract.
For the conclusion of an analogue contract, traders shall be provided with natural gas trading for a specified period of time by the existing natural gas trader at a price fixed by it.
The draft Cabinet Regulations detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and user.
The rules shall lay down the arrangements for the supply and withdrawal of natural gas to users, the requirements for safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of the trader, public trader, system operator, user and owner of the gasified facility in relation to the supply and use of natural gas; the arrangements for the billing of services received, the amount of the delay rate, the arrangements for switching traders and for the supply of users in the event of disruption of the supply of natural gas; the arrangements for the supply of natural gas to connected users by the public trader.

They're holding a man with a gun on Aspasia Boulevard.
State police (VP) detained a man armed with a gun on Aspazia Boulevard on Friday, said the representative of the PP Gita Gzybowska.
The D.O.C. has received a report of a man walking down Aspasia Boulevard who is unsecured, armed and appears to be in a serious condition.
A crew that went to the call was in a car accident, and the man stopped another crew.
A gas can was found in the passenger's possession.
It has been reported that on Friday, in a hurry to get a call, a State Police (VP) car drove into the center of Riga.
The accident occurred while driving on a category A call or attempting to avoid a situation where human health or life is at risk.
However, at the corner of Barona and Dzirnava, a light car collided with a truck.
Minister: next week, the decision on the salary increase for the Director-General of the ILO is expected.
Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Greens and Farmers Union (ZZZ)), plans to discuss next week with Prime Minister Marie Kuczynski (ZZZ) and the coalition partners of the government the salary increase of the Director-General of the State Revenue Service (SRS).
Reizniece-Ozola told reporters on Friday that the issue of increasing the salary of the Director-General of the VID needed to be addressed urgently in order to make the post more attractive to potential candidates for re-commissioning.
The changes to the tender conditions will also be discussed next week.
The Minister also stressed that she had no specific candidate in mind to talk to about applying for the vacant post.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola expressed the view that the head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Kolegova, would have been a good director general of the IEA.
As regards the current acting Director of the IDA, Daci Pelēko, who has expressed her willingness to run for the post, the Minister reiterated the view that the new Director-General of the IDA should be a 'fringe observer' and not come from within the IDA structure.
She also stressed that she was waiting for the Saeima to return from its holiday to move as soon as possible to amend the law necessary for the reorganisation of the VID.
The BNS has already reported that the head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Kollegova, has submitted a proposal to the Minister of Finance, Dana Reizniece-Ozola (ZZS), withdrawing her candidacy for the post of Director General of the VID.
In her application, she said that it was not an easy choice, but that her family had been under severe emotional pressure during the past two weeks, even though there had been no illegal activity.
She also pointed out that the discussion of her candidacy had increased the divisions between the parties in the ruling coalition, which was also unacceptable.
It was also reported that the former Director-General of the ICC, Inara Peterson, resigned at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; stock indices in the United States and Europe are rising, and the value of the U.S. dollar is rising.
Global oil prices continued to rise on Friday morning, with investor sentiment buoyed by comments by Saudi Arabia's oil minister that have raised hopes that the biggest oil producers will come together at the September OPEC meeting to stabilize the world oil market.
The three major U.S. stock indexes hit record highs on Thursday, the highest since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several large companies.
The rise in oil prices and strong financial performance of several companies on Thursday also contributed to the rise in European stock indices.
The US dollar appreciated against the euro, the pound sterling and the Japanese yen on Thursday.
The price of crude oil traded on the New York Stock Exchange electronically on September's WTI stock market surged $1.78 to $43.49 a barrel.
Brent crude oil surged $1.99 to $46.04 a barrel on the London Stock Exchange in October.
The turnover of the canned food producer Blue Lagoon decreased by 33,8% this year.
The turnover of the cannery Blue Lagoon was EUR 4,202 million last year, down 33,8% on the previous year, while the company's losses decreased by 5,7 times to EUR 904,7 thousand, according to the annual financial statements published in the Lursoft database.
The management report states that in 2015 the company was operating at a loss for several reasons, including the permanent cash shortage caused by UniCredit Bank's exit from the Baltic market, the termination of the previously existing credit line and the failure of the Blue Lagoon to fulfil its contracts.
As a result, the company did not have sufficient funds to purchase cheaper raw materials in bulk and receive volume discounts.
The exit of the banks concerned from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing EU Structural Fund support projects that would have allowed the plant to purchase new production equipment and upgrade infrastructure.
The financial generators of the company were also negatively affected by the increase in raw material prices and the unwillingness of customers to pay more for the goods produced by the company last year.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the interested parties.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet received any information on the measures taken by the Greek authorities to comply with the restructuring plan.
The investors have already visited the company's largest creditor, UniCredit Leasing, where the parties have met and discussed possible investment plans.
The Commission notes that the restructuring plan was implemented in the course of the restructuring period.
This plan included improvements and optimisation of technological processes to achieve higher production productivity and capacity.
'Several equipment was purchased to increase production speed,' the company's management stated.
The management of the Blue Lagoon notes that the equipment purchased will allow the company's plant to fulfil orders in 2016 that were not possible before.
The first batch of production to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
Since the sales notes have already been signed, all production will be sold in accordance with the sales notes.
The new product will increase turnover by around EUR 300 000 per month", the company's management says.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement for the supply of fish products to Iraq in August 2016.
The Blue Lagoon has sent its first experimental container to Israel in 2016, expanded its market to Cyprus and will sign a cooperation agreement with a new US supermarket chain in September.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase its turnover.
In 2014, the Blue Lagoon had a turnover of EUR 6,347 million and a loss of EUR 5,113 million.
The Blue Lagoon was established in 1997 and has a paid-up capital of EUR 1,156 million.
The company is owned by two Latvian private individuals, Mikhail Kaidanov (89,11%) and Igor Shirshon (10,89%).
You are welcome to the museum on the 15th to meet the film giant Zarr Leander and attend the press conference.
Riga can be considered the birthplace and inspiration of the career of the beloved film star Zara Leander.
Zara Lander's visit to her godmother Ruth, the wife of the Swedish ambassador to Latvia, in Riga in 1924 proved to be fateful, because she discovered the unusual low contralto that she had mastered when she performed on stage at the Riga Cabaret Theatre.
Perhaps the accidental insanity in Riga was a fatal turn in Zara's creative path to world fame.
Riga was a warm memory for Zara Leander, and she had hoped to visit Riga for a visit, but unfortunately, her hopes were dashed when World War II broke out.
Using the form of a show, this meeting will be possible at the Riga Festival 2016 and the great Eva Kerēvica will play the role of the outstanding Zara Leandre.
Traffic restrictions are in place in the Aglona area.
To ensure the safety of participants in the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, from August 12th this year at 17:00 to August 15th at 18:00 the transit of trucks will be closed on several state highways in the vicinity of Aglona, VAS Latvia National Roads informed.
The Aglona celebrants and public transport will not be affected by these restrictions.
It should be noted that construction work is underway on the P62 Kraslav-Preiļi-Madona section of the motorway from Kraslav to Kraslav station (0,80.-4.00 km) and only public transport and pedestrians will be allowed to cross the construction site on the Aglona festival.
Other road users will be provided with bypass traffic in the file attached to the scheme.
Traditionally, these festivals attract large crowds, including pilgrims.
Drivers should therefore exercise particular caution as there will be heavy pedestrian traffic on the various motorway routes towards Aglon.
Drivers are encouraged to be sensible about the traffic restrictions, the rules of the road and the possible longer journey times.
The water temperature in all water bodies has dropped below +20 degrees.
The temperature of the water will continue to drop as the winter season progresses, and it is currently below +20 degrees Celsius in all rivers and lakes, as well as in the sea, according to data from the Latvian Centre for Environment, Geology and Meteorology.
The sea will cool to +16...+18 degrees, the wind has caused the water temperature to drop to +13 degrees on the west coast of the Gulf of Riga, and to +9 degrees in Paradise.
The water temperature in the river Lelyupa and Daugava, as well as in the large lakes, is +18..+20 degrees, in other bodies of water +14..+19 degrees.
Before the year, the water temperature in rivers and lakes on August 12 reached +24..+25 degrees, the warm water on the southern coast of the Gulf of Riga was up to +22 degrees.
Russian military aircraft identified near the Latvian border.
Russian military aircraft identified near the Latvian border, the BNS agency learned from the National Armed Forces.
On 17 December 2014, the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Latvia issued a statement on the situation in the Baltic Sea.
The BNS has repeatedly reported that Russian military aircraft and naval vessels are regularly spotted at the Latvian border.
Two children were sexually assaulted in an amusement park in England.
Berkshire police are searching for a man who sexually abused two six-year-old girls at a Legoland theme park, reports the Daily Mail.
Police have asked parents to look at photos taken at the amusement park, as they may show the attacker.
The girls told their parents what had happened.
The man was unknown to the girls, white in color, about 20 years old.
Kurdish activists occupy the German public broadcaster.
A large Kurdish group of 30 people stormed the WDR building in Düsseldorf on Thursday evening, where they held a nearly two-hour protest, German police said.
Protesters who came with placards chanted various slogans in an attempt to draw attention to the current situation in Turkey.
Officials say the demonstration was largely peaceful and that the protesters eventually left voluntarily at the request of the workers.
The insurer shall pay compensation to passengers whose flights are cancelled at the airport on Wednesday.
If Insurance paid travel insurance premiums to a family for a flight cancelled at Riga Airport on Wednesday 10 August, which caused them to cancel their planned visit to a music festival.
On 11 August, If Insurance received a claim for compensation from a client.
The family had planned to go to a music festival in Belgium, but because the flight was cancelled at the airport on Wednesday, the customer was charged a fee of EUR 204 for the accommodation reservation, which could no longer be cancelled, and for the tickets purchased for the festival.
The airline has promised to reimburse customers for the money spent on air tickets.
If the insurance of all travel insurance premiums has paid compensation for the interruption or cancellation of the trip in an average of 15% of cases.
"Tickets are reimbursed for purchase, return, or exchange, and accommodation is reserved", says Dagnija Rutka, director of the Risk Insurance Product at If Insurance.
As is known, on the evening of 10 August a private aircraft stopped at Riga Airport due to technical problems, so only a few outbound flights were cancelled, but several incoming flights had to be diverted to other airports.
A neighbor's renovation brings a man to a crumbling roof and forces him to leave his home.
LTV's Studio 4 spoke to Dmitry Saidyashev, whose neighbor started a major renovation of his apartment and since then Dmitry has been feeling a bit of a leak and is not sure if it is safe to stay in the apartment.
The problem is, my neighbors have been doing construction work and my apartment has a broken roof.
I then informed the city of Riga, the building manager and other organizations.
The building board said we're not an operational service and we don't have any experts.
"The owner of the house has to go to the Latvian Union of Engineers, and an expert will be there", Dmitry explains.
An expert on the case arrived, recorded the incident and concluded that the cover was in poor condition.
But it's been a month since Dmitry first applied to the building authority, and until early this week, no one could say whether his stay in the apartment was life-threatening.
The building department said, "That's the law, wait, if you're not satisfied, write to everyone in turn".
"Then I wrote to the Riga City Hall, but they sent it to the building manager, then the manager went back to the construction company, and then there was a dead end", Dmitry says.
After examining the pile of paper, it is clear that construction work has been suspended, although at any moment you may hear someone working there.
The expertise would be required within two months, and the owner of the apartment building would have six months to correct all these defects.
The independent expert has drawn up his opinion, but the building authority considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert did not indicate whether the metal railing in this supporting structure was damaged, so there is no certainty that the owner of the lower apartment is at risk.
"That is why we asked this expert for more information", says Ilze Zuka, a representative of the City of Riga's building department.
Despite the ban on any renovation work on the upper floor, the building work continues.
The fine for building without a building permit is between EUR 70 and EUR 700, but in this case the fine can be much higher.
Pending the expert's opinion, the building board has decided that both the apartment building and Dmitry's apartment should be closed.
'This is a case in which the building authority has not used the practice of the public, who may have, through their ignorance or simply unwillingness, put at risk not only their own property but also the owner of the sub-property, which has prevented him from using his property in this way,' says the building authority's representative.
Now Dmitry has to find a new place to live - with relatives, friends, a hotel, or a new apartment.
But Dmitry can try to recover the damage from his neighbor in a civil suit, which can take a long time.
Due to the ongoing construction, both apartments are currently off-limits until the civil engineer gives his approval, which can take up to three weeks.
The owner of the apartment where the renovation was carried out will have to pay for the damage.
The owner of this apartment faces up to six months in prison for failing to comply with the construction authority's orders.
Think about it.
How many lava flowers are in this picture?
The correct answer is five.
In Ukraine, five white lion cubs were born in the Demidov Zoo near Kiev.
Everyone feels good and sometimes has a bad reaction to the joint feeding.
The cost of converting the former Kemmer Sanatorium into a five-star hotel is EUR 22 million.
The cost of converting the former Kemmer spa into a five-star hotel 'Park Hotel Kemmer' will be EUR 22 million, Gita Želve, representative of the future hotel manager SIA 'Park Hotel Kemmer', told LETA.
The establishment of the hotel is the first stage of the renovation of the former health resort of Kemer.
The second phase will be a wellness clinic, scheduled to open in 2022, while the hotel is scheduled to open in May 2018.
Želve notes that the exact costs of the clinic are not yet known.
However, she notes that it will be located in the former 12,000-square-foot [4,000 sq m] building of the Kemer Medical Center.
The clinic will be on three floors.
The owner of Park Hotel Kemeri and the proposed clinic is the international fund G Capital Europe, which invests in European assets.
G Capital Europe is owned by several investors who invest in the fund, according to Želve.
As previously stated by George John, CEO of G Capital Europe, the investment in the former resort polyclinic is expected to be between EUR 12 and 15 million, for a total investment of over EUR 30 million.
It has already been reported that the restoration of the cultural and historical park covering an area of more than 42 hectares, the restoration of the driveways and street sections, the construction of an interactive natural tourism object, the improvement of the territory and the construction of a parking lot on Emil Dārziņa Street, which will contribute to the socio-economic development of the city of Jurmala and the increase in tourist numbers, Jurmala dome plans to attract EUR 14.5 million from the European Union funds, co-financing with EUR three to four million.
The design work is scheduled to last until mid-2017, but construction and refurbishment work will start in the autumn of next year.
The historic health resort complex of Kemeri is reportedly planned to house a five-star Park Hotel Kemeri and a wellness clinic.
However, the reconstruction took time.
The 2010 report also stated that Ominasis would continue to maintain regular communication with the hotel operator Kempinski, which continues to provide day-to-day technical controls at the Kemeri Sanatorium', and that 'the reconstruction of the existing Kemeri Hotel would be completed' by 2011 and that preparations for the opening of the Kempinski Hotel chain would begin immediately.
In October 2014, Park Hotel Kemi confirmed its willingness to purchase the Kemer Sanatorium property belonging to the bankrupt Ominasis Latvia at an auction, but a month later the auction was declared void because the winner had not paid for the purchase within the agreed time.
The sale price was set at the starting price of the last unsuccessful auction, EUR 2,86 million.
As the representative of the municipality, Ieva Aile, informed LETA, the municipality confirmed by signing the protocol that it would be supporting the restoration of the historic Kemmerer Park, the creation of an interactive nature tourism site, connected roads and parking lots with the support of the co-financing of the European Union Structural Funds.
The President will present the opera singer Antonenko with the Order of the Three Stars.
The President of the Republic, Raymond Vejon, will present the Order of the Three Stars to the opera singer of the third class, Alexander Antonenko, on August 16, according to the agenda of the President.
The award ceremony for the Order of the Three Stars will be at the Black Swan House at 1:00.
According to information provided by the Latvian National Opera and Ballet (LNOB), Antonenko graduated from the Józef Medin Music College in 1998, where he studied percussion and singing under Margarita Gruzdeva.
He studied at the Vocal Department of the Latvian Academy of Music under Józef Vītol in the class of Arvīds Lustes.
In 1997, he began singing in the Latvian National Opera choir, but in 1998 he debuted with the role of Oberto in G.F.Handel's opera "Alčína".
He received the "Lielo Music Award 2003" for vocal performance in opera performances and in Verdi's Requiem.
It is noted that in the 2004/2005 season he became the most internationally renowned Latvian tenor, being engaged by the world's major opera houses.
Since autumn 2004 he has sung at the Deutsche Oper am Rhein in Düsseldorf, the Berlin and Graz Opera, the Semperoper in Dresden, the Royal Opera in Oslo and Stockholm, the Covent Garden Opera in London, the Monte Carlo Opera, the Vienna State Opera, as well as the Geneva, Dresden and Düsseldorf Opera and the Salzburg Festival.
In 2009, Antonenko made her debut with great success in the Metropolitan Opera as Prince in Nara.
In 2011, Antonenko sang the title role in Othello with Ricardo Muti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at the Paris Opera, at the Covent Garden Opera he sang in the new production of Luigi's Settlement, and in Stockholm he performed in The Girl from the West by Christoph Loy.
A year later, Antonenko sang the role of Othello with great success at London's Covent Garden Opera.
The e-mail of former NATO commander Bradlov was hacked by Russian hackers.
Hackers who hacked into the computers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in the United States may have carried out several other cyberattacks, including the email of Philip Breedlove, former commander of NATO's European force, and the servers of the George Soros Open Society Institute, Bloomberg Business News reported Thursday.
The hackers published the information on DCLeaks.com.
Among other things, it included a list of Bradlov and information about the work of the Soros Institute.
The hackers had access to the institute's computers for a year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyberattacks were carried out by the same hackers with ties to Russian intelligence who hacked into the DNC's emails.
The Wall Street Journal reports that the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama is considering new sanctions on Russia in response to the DNC hack.
To enforce the sanctions, the administration will officially prosecute hackers backed by Russia or the Russian authorities for a cyberattack on the Democratic Party's servers.
WikiLeaks reportedly released in July some 20,000 emails obtained from the DNC computer system that suggested Democratic Party leaders were trying to damage the campaign of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's former running mate, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, in the Democratic primary.
According to US media sources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating the hack of the Democrats' servers, and other US intelligence officials believe that Russia's involvement in the cyber attack is almost beyond doubt.
Yoko Ono's presence was a threat to The Beatles.
Paul McCartney admitted that Yoko Ono's presence had created a sense of danger for the legendary group The Beatles.
The 74-year-old rock star currently has a "good" relationship with the widow of the late John Lennon, but at the time she went to visit the band in the recording studio, McCartney was afraid of her because Ono was the only female member of the group - George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Lennon and McCartney - among them.
When asked about their relationship, the singer told Rolling Stone magazine: "They're really good".
We felt threatened at the time.
She was sitting on the amplifiers while we were recording.
Most of the group couldn't stand it.
We did, but not very successfully, because we were under a lot of stress.
We weren't sexist, but girls didn't usually come to the recording studio, they let us work.
When John first met Yoko, she was not sitting in the control room.
The Yellow Submarine recording artist also admitted that he now regularly communicates with former bandmate Ringo, and occasionally confirms Apple's recording studio plans, but otherwise the Beatles are "finished".
Asked if he would meet the only other living member of the legendary rock band, McCartney told Rolling Stone: "Not often".
We meet at social events and parties.
But I didn't go to the meetings, and I felt a little isolated.
I left Apple during a tough divorce.
I sent John Eastman to the meetings in my place and said, "Let me know what everyone says, because I can't stand sitting at that table".
It was too painful, like watching your pet die.
The company now works so I just listen to all the tapes.
I'm part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus was once a habitable planet
According to NASA's latest climate models, Venus was once a habitable planet.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center have developed a model to study the history of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, which has a hot surface, no water, and an atmosphere made up almost entirely of carbon, once had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation is due to its dense atmosphere.
But recent simulations suggest that Venus once had a flat, Earth-like atmosphere that was slowly rotating.
The model also looks at the earliest topography of Venus.
The planet was drier than Earth, but it had enough water and geographical diversity to support life and to keep water from evaporating.
In the early days of Venus, the sun was 30 percent brighter.
In the GISS model simulation, the rotation model of Venus reveals that the daylight part of the day lasts for two months, explained GISS scientist Antonio Del Genio in a press release.
This process heats the planet's surface and causes matter to form thick clouds that act as a rain shield, shielding the planet from the sun's heat.
The result is a temperate climate, actually a few degrees warmer than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, similar to the theory of evolution that scientists have hypothesized.
Although once habitable, Venus has been subjected to extreme heat and ultraviolet radiation for billions of years.
Their oceans were evaporated and their algae were scorched by ultraviolet rays.
When the water completely evaporated, all that was left was a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly greenhouse gas known today as Venus.
The scientists published the results of their new model of the climate of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is stepping down as Avalanche coach.
On Thursday, Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey operations Patrick Roy filed a motion to dismiss, citing a lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado vice president and general manager Joe Sack confirmed the news and said the club will begin its search for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have been energetic, passionate, and dedicated in my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for Colorado", said Roy, 50.
I've spent a lot of time this summer thinking about how I can improve the performance of the team to give it the brilliance it needs and achieve the highest level of results.
To achieve this, the visions of the head coach and the VP of hockey operations shall be fully aligned with the visions of the organisation.
He should also be able to influence decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sack, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sack said Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organization and wish him well in the future.
In his first season with the Avalanche in 2013-14, Roy was named the league's Coach of the Year and received the Jack Adams Award.
He helped the team to 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but Colorado was eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Minnesota Twins.
The Avalanche finished the 2015-16 season with a 39-39-4 record, five points behind the Wild, and did not receive a second Western Conference invitation.
Hall of Fame goalie Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career - two with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil rig workers resume talks and call off strike
The strike by workers over the pay of North Sea oil rig workers has been called off as negotiations between the two sides resume, the negotiators said.
There are periodic strikes against the Wood Group oil refinery on the North Sea oil platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
The joint statement stated that the unions of Wood Group and Unite and RMT agreed to resume negotiations to resolve the dispute.
Several full-day meetings are planned over the next week, starting early next week, to review the issues.
The unions have announced that their recent measures, organised after a break of more than 25 years, are aimed at a planned 30% wage cut.
Due to negative market pressure, Wood Group has reduced the wages of its North Sea employees by 9% this year.
As early as 2014, the company cut the wages of its land workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional wage cuts would allow the company to survive the downturn in the market.
Shell has already cut the salaries of several thousand people and announced plans to wind down its oil and gas operations in 10 countries to optimise its work in preparation for a major merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from falling oil prices, and the situation is further complicated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
Earlier this week, Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues of the day - plans for a strike in the North Sea.
He said the North Sea was vital to the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits all, not just individuals.
In 2016, almost USD 1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new North Sea projects, compared to USD 7 billion invested over the last five years.
Kepler measured the rotation of stars in the Pleiades.
The latest Kepler mission has helped astronomers to compile the most comprehensive catalog of the rotation rates of stars in the Pleiades.
The new data help astronomers understand why stars in this star rotate at different speeds and how the rotation of stars can be related to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we can learn more about the relationship between the mass, age, and even history of stars in their solar system", says Louise Rebula, a scientist at Caltech's Pasadena Infrared Process and Analysis Center.
The Pleiades star is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in this galaxy are just beginning to grow, reaching about 125 million years of age.
They're spinning at full speed.
At their maximum speed, these rising stars emit a large amount of stellar wind.
When winds enter the star's magnetic field, they slow down the star.
As stars age, their rotation slows.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by measuring the time between the appearance of a recognizable star region, such as the solar eclipse.
The latest catalogue of stellar rotation rates shows that larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller ones.
Rebul compares stars to dancers, with larger-body dancers performing pirouettes more slowly than smaller-body dancers.
Rebul says that the Pleiades' "ballet" shows that slow-spinning objects are larger and more massive, while faster-spinning objects are very small stars.
Because of its close proximity, Pleiades serves as a vast space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars and their rotation rates.
Rebul says that the Pleiades helps to build theoretical models of star rotation in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have much to learn about how, when, and why stars slow down and stop completely.
Rebull and his colleagues have detailed their analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiadian stars in three new publications soon to be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
