The number of new cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is expected to increase rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The overall incidence of coronavirus (COVID-19) infection is similar across the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, suggesting that, although the prevalence varies from country to country, COVID-19 infection spreads rapidly in all countries.
In light of the situation in Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared to accommodate the large number of COVID-19 patients who require care, especially in intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a number of cases of an unknown respiratory infection were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the outbreak was caused by a new strain of coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
From now on, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 will be known as coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Current evidence suggests that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild illness, such as respiratory infection or respiratory distress, and most will recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 is associated with a severe illness requiring hospitalization, while 6% of cases are considered to be a severe illness requiring intensive care.
The overall mortality rate for COVID-19 hospitalizations is 4%.
In this study, we will look at the overall COVID-19 situation in each European/EEA country and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it to that in Hubei Province, China.
We will also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom with that of Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom
As in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries and the COVID-19 pandemic will spread to other countries as well.
On 11 March 2020, the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
On 5 March 2020, the Eurosurveillance report, Spiteri et al., reported the first European case of COVID-19 according to the WHO definition.
In the European Union/EEA, the first three cases were reported in France on 24 January 2020; they were people who had returned to France from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were reported in all 30 European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom (UK), and as of 31 December 2019 and counting, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths were reported, with Italy accounting for 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths.
Total number and total number of cases of COVID-19
According to the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases per country, which is obtained exclusively from official sources such as national health ministries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated daily at 8 a.m.
They used this data to estimate the spread of COVID-19 in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, and compared it to Italy.
In terms of the actual incidence of COVID-19, we consider the 14-day incidence of COVID-19 in people with COVID-19, and therefore we consider the incidence of COVID-19, in each European country/European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also provided the total number of cases in each country as of 15 March 2020 at 8 a.m., compared to the Italian data from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the European Union/EEA and the United Kingdom
The incidence of COVID-19 in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom over 14 days is similar to that in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, COVID-19 began to peak around 21 February and then reached a moderate peak around 28 February 2020 (Additional data).
It was largely driven by the high number of cases in Italy, but in all European Union/EEA countries the number of COVID-19 cases were also rising (Some data).
Figure 2 represents the total number of cases of COVID-19 in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom compared to Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It shows that, as of 8 a.m. on 15 March, 15 other European/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had the same number of cases as Italy had 3 weeks or less earlier.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
The data on the total number of COVID-19 cases indicate that the epidemic is spreading in a similar way in other countries.
This is despite the fact that countries differ in their treatment, healthcare professionals' treatment, and sometimes interpretation of the disease in different ways from country to country and the rules for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19, including follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, Italian primary care physicians reported that 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care and media reports suggested that intensive care units in regional hospitals were overcrowded.
Data on COVID-19 cases that were hospitalized and/or in intensive care are currently available in the European Union/European Economic Area for only 6% of the population and 1% (data not shown).
However, they should be carefully combined to complement the latest data on the number of cases and deaths.
A 201011 study showed a dramatic change in intensive care and intermediate beds in Europe, with 29.2 beds per 100 000 population in Germany and 4.2 beds per 100 000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less capacity than Italy (12.5 intensive care and medium beds per 100,000 population in 2010).
The improvement of the quality of care for patients with out-of-hospital conditions, with the approximate figures for all European/EEA countries and the United Kingdom in terms of hospital admissions for COVID-19 and for a &gt; 90% risk of a lack of intensive care beds, is provided in the six new ECDC risk assessment for COVID-19.
Because of the high prevalence of cases in some parts of the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, and because intensive care units are often used to cover a specific region, information on illnesses and intensive care beds should be freely available in the so-called Data Level 2 (NUTS-2) data block nomenclature.
The recent developments in Italy and other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly across the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared to respond to the increased number of SARS-CoV-2 cases and the increased number of COVID-19 cases requiring treatment, especially in intensive care, such as that in the Italian regions where the disease is present.
As demonstrated in the recent emergency assessment by the ECDC, a rapid, effective and highly effective method is essential to prevent the spread of SARS-COV-2, to divert the attention of the infected population and to focus on reducing the cost of contamintaion; as anticipating the spread of infection will not be enough to inform decision making and hospitals will not have the time to understand, accept and prepare for treatment without testing in advance.
The emergency response plan also addresses the health needs of the population to slow the spread of infectious diseases.
There is little scope at this time for countries to increase controls on their efforts to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to put pressure on health authorities.
If they do not, health services in some European/EEA countries will have more patients who will need to be placed in intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has already killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere worldwide, making it a major public health threat.
In relation to its cousin virus, SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may have also originated from bats and has similar symptoms and mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 is less virulent and less lethal than SARS but is more transmissible and more likely to affect older adults than younger adults and more likely to affect males than females.
As the literature on the disease continues to grow, the purpose of this article is to provide timely information and to discuss the research activities in this field.
We will cover key aspects of the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of this disease.
Although many questions remain unanswered, we hope that this article will help you to identify and treat this dreadful disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 became a unique and memorable event for all Chinese people, as they were instructed to stay indoors for the entire festival and for several weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of a new severe disease.
The virus is closely related to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; it was renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease it causes is now called CoV Disease 19 (COVID-19).
The pandemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout China and to nearly 50 countries worldwide.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had caused more than 80,000 cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 recoveries and discharges and more than 3,000 deaths.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "humanity's No. 1 enemy" and could be more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, women have published more than 200 articles on COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 describing how the virus is spread to more people.
This article will attempt to summarize the research that is being done on this new and rapidly spreading phenomenon.
Where possible, we will attempt to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other diseases caused by CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, which emerged in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned about the management and prognosis of this disease and other important questions.
CoVs are not considered to be a major cause of death, accounting for approximately 15% of all cases of the common cold 4.
However, in this century, we have encountered two double-current human co-virus strains, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and rapidly spread to other countries with high infection and fatality rates.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV to have emerged in human history.
As shown in figure. Figure 1.1, a group of pneumonia of unknown origin was first reported in Wuhan on 31 February 2019 by the Chinese Public Health Administration.
Seven days later they identified the genesis of the CoV.
On 15 January 2020, the first case was confirmed in Wuhan.
During that time, the plague quickly spread to neighboring cities, counties, and countries.
On the 20th, the results of the tests were announced, indicating that the disease could be transmitted from person to person.
On 23 January, Wuhan was closed and public transport was suspended.
On 24 January, the first case was identified, of the 41 cases, only 21 were reported in the Wuhan seafood market where the outbreak originated from an unidentified animal.
On January 30, WHO declared the disease a global health emergency.
At the time of writing this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Fig. 2).
The speed of the changes is unknown, and their ultimate magnitude and intensity are unknown.
As of 11 February 2020, studies of 8,866 active cases and 4,021 positive cases of COVID-19 have revealed new data on the following epidemiological patterns (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/BiUl-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but mainly people aged 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of the cases were over 50 years of age, a small minority were under 20 years of age, and only 14 cases were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 was more commonly found in males (0.31 per 100,000) than in females (0.27 per 100,000).
COVID-19 has spread in clusters mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 has a median duration of 5 (2-9) days from onset to detection.
The average incubation period is 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average time from conception to death is 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The incidence rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the conversion rate of R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infections peaked before 23 January 2020, coinciding with the peak of the Chinese Spring Festival.
The overall mortality rate was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the change in the mortality rate was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60), and severe respiratory distress.
CoVs are part of a large family of viruses and among the viruses that have some relationship to RNA.
It can be divided into four categories, e.g., alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, respectively, alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The (S) glycoprotein membrane binds to its angiotensin receptors and is converted to enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then membrane-bound.
Viral RNA is released from the cytoplasm; after the virus is broken down, the viral RNA enters the glycoprotein envelope and the nucleocapsid proteins form a viral vesicle, which combines with the plasma to release the virus.
The first genome of SARS-CoV-2 was identified on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new beta-CoV strain with 99.98% blood identity in 10 samples collected from the site of its initial outbreak, the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to SARS-CoV but not to MERS-CoV.
The virus is transmitted through the respiratory tract of humans.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is less tightly bound to the human ACE2 than that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 does not cause severe human disease like SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also synthesize a new small protein from orf3b and produce a protein from orf8.
The orf3b strain of SARS-CoV-2 may be strongly responsible for the emergence of this virus and exhibiting IFNβ-like symptoms; however, orf8 has no known function or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., described the cryo-EM body of ACE2 in extremely tall humans at 2.9 Å of complexity containing the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that these complexes, which were open and closed, were linked together and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which provides evidence for the identification of CoV and the disease.
B0AT1 may be a potential candidate for use in therapeutic therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Source and secondary habitat
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via civet bats and camels.
Comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were the most common human host for SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-like CoVs from bats called SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, the mechanism by which the virus moved from animals to humans is still unknown, and we still don't know how it got there.
Ji, and his colleagues, suggested that the virus was carried from bats to humans by snakes and that it was fused into the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins - a mammal species commonly used as a vaccine in China - may be the second most likely host for SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% of the CoV-like blood found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference between the two viruses is still a significant difference; therefore, we will continue to wait for a definitive conclusion (Fig. (Fig. 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive outside their natural environment for up to 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and at 40%-50% relative humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be resistant to ultraviolet radiation and to temperatures of 56 °C for 30 minutes; or, 75% ethanol, chlorine-based disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other disinfectants, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively kill the virus.
All humans are immunocompromised to SARS-CoV-2, so the new virus is highly contagious.
Currently, there has not been extensive research on the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
Therefore, only previous studies with other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Mot. (Mot.4).4) can be considered.
Typically, when a virus infects a host, the host's immune system recognizes it through its receptor (PRRs) including its C-type transporter, its Toll-like receptor (TLR), its NOD-like receptor (NLR), and its RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through various mechanisms, the virus induces inflammation, increases dendritic cells, and shortly binds to interferon-like I (IFNs) that inhibit viral proliferation and facilitate the release of anti-viral substances.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus to evade the effects of the pathogenic immune system.
More recently, the immune system has been able to combine to fight off the virus.
T-lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play a key role in the immune response.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies against the virus, and CD8+ T cells immediately kill the virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce cytokines that release a specific antigen to help the immune system.
However, the CoV can inhibit T cell function in the T cell death model.
Antibodies to the pathogenic agents such as C3a and C5a and antibodies are also important in fighting this virus.
For example, antibodies extracted from recovered patients killed MERS-CoV.
But an overreaction of the immune system can release more radiation than is needed, and this can damage the lungs and other organs, and worse, cause organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is initially isolated, is more commonly found in elderly people with underlying medical conditions and in pregnant women.
People who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune systems are weakened are at a higher risk of contracting these diseases than others.
The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, with a typical incubation period of 3-7 days based on studies conducted in the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 people showed that the incubation period was an average of 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as mentioned above, showed that the average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2 days) in 8,866 subjects.
It is important for healthcare providers to adjust the period of quarantine to the actual period of exposure, as this will prevent people with symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As is typically the case, for people who have been in contact with or have had contact with infected individuals, the virus requires a 14-day quarantine.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and first symptom of COVID-19, which may occur alone or with other symptoms such as severe cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, vertigo, fever, sore throat, nasal congestion, chest pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and vomiting.
Some patients experience breathing difficulties and/or shortness of breath for up to a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients soon developed shortness of breath, heart palpitations, excess acid, and blood clotting problems.
People with fever and/or respiratory distress and high fever, even if suspected of having pulmonary dyspnoea, should be screened for this condition.
A randomized controlled trial conducted in late December 2019 showed that the symptoms were 98% fever, 76% cough, 55% vertigo, and 3% diarrhea; 8% of the patients required ventilation.
They found similar results in two recent studies of pathogens and their transmission in non-infected populations.
However, a 2012 study found that MERS-CoV infections were more commonly associated with fever (98%), severe diarrhea (47%), and shortness of breath (55%) among the major symptoms.
However, 80% of these patients required ventilation, more than the number of people who contracted COVID-19 and died from MERS-like illnesses such as COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also reported in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), severe cough (29%-75%), dizziness (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were the most common symptoms and approximately 14%-20% of patients required ventilation support.
As of 14 February, the global COVID-19 death toll stood at 2% with a global total of 66 576.
For comparison, the number of deaths from SARS in November 2002 was 10% of the total 8,096 cases.
In the case of MERS, according to a census conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate was 37 percent of the 2,494 cases.
Preliminary studies have shown that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, death rate, and R0 is shown in Table Table 1.1.
The above figures indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but will kill fewer people than the latter two.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 virus than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The flocks usually come from the same family or place or come as a boat.
The cases are usually people who have traveled to or lived in or other areas where the disease has been introduced or infected in the last two weeks before its onset.
However, it appears that people can be carriers of the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that recovered patients who are discharged from hospital may be carriers of the virus, therefore prolonging the quarantine period is necessary.
Patients with normal or low white blood cell counts (especially lymphocytes) at the very beginning of the disease.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of 4×109/L with a lymphocyte count of 1×109/L, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were observed in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Liver and vascular enzymes and myoglobin levels were elevated in some patients, and C-proteins and erythrocytes were elevated in most patients.
In patients with severe disease, the level of dimer D, a blood vessel defect, increased, and the lymphocytes began to decline gradually.
Chest pain was observed in many patients with COVID-19 and was characterized by irregular dark patches or dark areas in the lungs.
Patients often had asthma, severe lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In the case of ARDS, severe pain, increased fluid pressure, and deterioration of the fibrosis cause the airway to be painful.
Impaired function of type I and II pneumocytes reduces surfactant levels and increases the site of pain, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to open and increasing the risk of pulmonary embolism.
Thus, the severity of the lung disease they developed was often related to the severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first analysis of COVID-19 showed the destruction of pneumocytes, hyaline fragments, and internal lymphocyte rupture, and cell fractures in the lungs of people who died from the disease; it is consistent with the pathology of the virus and ARDS and similar to that of people infected with SARS and MERS.
Identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by transcription-regulated transcriptase-reactive RNA (RT-PCR) was used as a key marker for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high level of false positives, which could exacerbate the disease, the use of diagnostic imaging (not limited to RT-PCR) was introduced in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar process was used to identify SARS.
Therefore, the combination of the history of the disease, the outcome, laboratory tests, and radiographic findings is important and will help in the diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the team Feng Zhang described a method using the CRISPR SHERLOCK-based SARS-CoV-2 detection method to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 20 × 10-18 mol/L or 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 times per microliter) using a sample in less than one hour without any complications.
Hopefully, this new approach can significantly change the sensitivity and the efficacy of the treatment, if it is accepted after review.
Due to the lack of knowledge about the new CoV, doctors can only treat patients with COVID-19 in a limited way, while waiting for the majority of drugs that have been used or previously considered to be used to treat patients with other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and viral diseases (Table (Table2).2).
These include novel and potential treatments that include herbal products, immunosuppressants, steroids, patient-derived plasma, traditional Chinese medicine, and medical care.
Even plasma from a patient could be used as a medicine.
Pharmaceutical companies will work hard to develop drugs and vaccines for this virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the lungs initially and occasionally to a lesser extent other ACE2-sensitive organs, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory distress and depression are major risks for many patients and are the most fatal.
Therefore, respiratory therapy is essential for alleviating symptoms and recovery and includes medication with oxygen, oxygenation, noninvasive ventilation, and ventilation depending on the severity of the illness.
Patients with severe respiratory distress were treated with extracorporeal oxygen delivery (ECMO), a new type of heart transplantation used to treat severe heart attacks or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary and acute infections, and protecting vital organs are critical for people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Increased cytokine levels have been associated with an increased immune response in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokines are a complex of several cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
Cytokines stimulate immune cells to produce a variety of different radicals that often cause ARDS and organ damage.
Immunosuppressants are essential for cytokine therapy, especially in patients with severe disease.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an IL6 antibody, were used to treat cytokines.
Other immunosuppressive cytokine therapies include T cell-associated immunosuppressants; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF blockade; JAK inhibition; blinatumomabe; cytokine-expressing suppressor 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used as SARS treatment to reduce the severity of the event.
However, high-dose steroids were not significant for lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
However, it can cause complications, especially in blood cells, and have a significantly damaged prognosis.
However, low doses of corticosteroids were advised for patients with severe COVID-19 infection.
At the time of writing, there is no known cure for the virus.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has been shown to be effective in treating COVID-19 patients in the United States.
Remdesivir is an antiviral drug originally developed at Gilead to treat patients with Ebola and Marburg.
Later, remdesivir also showed potential against other RNA viruses including the MERS virus and SARS.
Based on these findings, Gilead has provided these materials to China for human testing of SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitin, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin, have been reported to be effective in treating patients with severe respiratory distress.
Diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, liver damage, and other adverse reactions may occur when this medication is combined with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The combination of these medications with other treatments that have been used for specific patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and antibodies from survivors
The collection of blood from survivors of a deadly disease to treat others who may have the same disease or to protect healthy people from infection has a long history.
Of course, survivors often have strong antibodies to fight off the germs in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) released by B lymphocytes to fight viruses and other pathogens and identify and then destroy the infected molecules.
Based on these data, plasma is collected from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and is isolated from 10 patients who were critically ill.
They improved after 24 hours; the viral load decreased and the oxygen level in the blood was maintained.
However, verification and clarification are essential to recommend the use of this method for use before a validated treatment is developed.
Also, because of the side effects of the drug, other plasma risks should be considered.
For example, antibodies can stimulate the immune system and trigger the release of cytokines, which are potentially life-threatening.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies to fight a pandemic.
Therefore, it is important and desirable to isolate B cells from recovering patients and to determine the potency of these antibodies or to carry them to determine whether these antibodies can attack viral proteins.
In this way, we can produce antibodies more quickly.
TCM has been used to treat many conditions in China for many years.
However, the risks are due to the combination of many different substances depending on the disease pattern according to TCM.
Many of these active ingredients are unknown or poorly understood because of the difficulty of extracting and verifying these ingredients and their proper synthesis.
Currently, due to the lack of a robust and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become a preferred option for people with mild to moderate symptoms or who have recovered from severe illness.
For example, the capsule therapy of Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen was found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest survival rates from COVID-19 vaccination were observed in several Chinese provinces that used TCM in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei Province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, only one survival rate (13%).
However, this comparison is difficult because other factors such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease must be considered during the assessment.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) itself with the treatment of WM and TCM.
It was found that the time needed for the body to cool down, symptoms to subside, and clinical outcomes were shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group.
Most notably, the incidence of symptoms (from mild to severe) was much lower for the WM+TCM group than for the WM alone group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM alone group (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM has yet to be confirmed after extensive clinical trials.
It will also focus on understanding the mechanisms and explaining the potencies of the components of TCM medicines or their combinations where possible.
People who think they may have or have COVID-19 are more likely to be afraid of a potentially life-threatening illness, and people in quarantine are more likely to be anxious, lonely, and angry.
In addition, infectious symptoms such as fever, oxygen deprivation, and coughing and other medical complications such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia can lead to increased anxiety and depression.
In the early stages of SARS, patients were reported to have exhibited a range of symptoms including severe depression, anxiety, shock, irritability, memory loss, depression, and even suicide attempts.
Contact tracing and quarantine to protect people from COVID-19 can lead to increased anxiety and guilt over the transmission of the disease, quarantine, and distress to family and friends.
Therefore, they should provide medical care to people with COVID-19, those who are suspected to have it, and to anyone who needs it.
Healthcare professionals should consider selecting a multi-person support team, maintaining open and timely communication and providing accurate and up-to-date information on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment options, and developing and implementing social distancing devices and software.
The vaccine is essential to prevent the spread of the virus to animals and humans and other species and is often combined with a viral vaccine to combat the serious disease caused by new viruses.
Efforts are underway to derive vaccines from protein S to produce long-lasting and effective antibodies that can kill and/or protect humans from SARS-CoV.
Women have tested life-saving vaccines against SARS in fish.
However, the true efficacy of these vaccines in the elderly and critically ill patients and their protection against animal-based viruses has not yet been established before the actual human trials have commenced.
This is probably because SARS lasted 17 years and no one else has been infected with the disease since then.
In contrast, individuals and small groups of people will continue to be infected with MERS virus in the Middle East and spread to other areas due to its zoonotic origin.
Researchers have developed a MERS vaccine that destroys the virus, cell DNA, viral vectors, microorganisms, viral material and viral protein fragments and have tested some in animals.
The development of effective and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 for people who are not vaccinated is critical and a critical component of the prevention of the spread of the disease.
However, it is difficult to overcome the challenges because of the long time it takes (about 18 months) to develop a vaccine and because of the large number of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show its impact in a limited number of populations.
In many cases, sufferers can recover gradually without any symptoms.
However, as was the case with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 will cause a panic attack in those who have it and will kill those who have it severely.
Therefore, the development of diagnostic models is essential for physicians to prioritize their work, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on human studies, the following factors may be associated with or affect the risk of infection with COVID-19 (Table (Table33):
Age: Age is a key factor in determining prognosis for SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mainly in the 30-65 age group as 47.7% of cases were in the 50+ age group in the 8,866 population study described above.
Patients in intensive care had more severe symptoms and pain and were more likely to live longer than those who did not (compared to 66 and 51 years), suggesting that age is one of the factors that can determine whether a person will survive COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 is more commonly found in males (0.31 per 100,000 versus 0.27 per 100,000), as described above.
Additional symptoms and complications: People with COVID-19 who require intensive care may experience increased respiratory distress and heart failure.
Cardiovascular disease was also the leading cause of death in people with SARS.
It is suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may be identical to ACE2 cholangiocytes, which may cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and chronic disease are closely related and can be linked.
Laboratory-based diagnosis: The level of protein C (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of the pain or tenderness in the arteries and is considered one of the factors that lead to the development of this disease, which will help in the treatment, and ultimately in the cure.
The relationship between CRP severity levels and COVID-19 prognosis was also discussed.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also play a role in determining survival.
These enzymes are produced in large quantities in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
As a result, it is often a cause of heart and liver failure.
Major symptoms: Chest radiography and the development of minor symptoms should be considered along with other factors to determine the likelihood of survival from COVID-19 and whether it is a serious concern.
Steroid use: As discussed above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as a treatment for viral infections to reduce the severity of pain.
Due to the use of corticosteroids in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed hematopoietic disease and had lifelong disabilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, low-dose and short-term steroid use should be considered in patients with COVID-19.
Depression: As discussed above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many people developed depression due to prolonged quarantine and the constant worry of witnessing the death of family members and other patients.
It is important to provide medical counseling and long-term care to help these patients recover from these stresses and return to normal life.
Based on the research conducted by the women, it appears that COVID-19 has some features that are different from SARS.
In addition to its lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also be spread through the upper respiratory tract and produce mild or no symptoms during the early stages of infection, as with other cold-causing CoVs.
As a result, people with early or active pre-emergency infections may produce more viruses in their daily lives, making it more difficult to fight the disease.
However, it appears that SARS-CoV is transmitted in the case of severe infection, but no significant transmission has been initiated.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is more severe and more difficult to control than that of SARS.
Intensive efforts are being made in China to restrict travel to Wuhan and surrounding cities and to continue the nationwide quarantine in the hopes of preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these efforts have had a devastating impact on the economy and other aspects of society, the number of new cases has decreased, indicating that epidemics are declining.
The best estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and the cooling period will last 3-4 months.
However, some scholars disagree.
Paul Hunter, and colleagues, believe that COVID-19, which has been found to be more contagious than SARS, will not be eliminated by 2020.
Ira Longini and colleagues developed a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and estimated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reports that SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the partial turbinates and throat swabs of patients who recovered and were discharged from hospital 2 weeks earlier; this suggests that the new virus may be a recurrent influenza-like illness.
However, positive signs have been seen in China in the number of new cases declining, indicating that the current approach will be successful.
Initially it was estimated that Ebola would kill about a million and a half million.
But with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually conquered.
It is also possible, as was the case with SARS-CoV, that the severity of SARS-CoV-2 could be reduced and eventually become a less virulent virus for humans.
Comparison between COVID-19 infection and that of SARS and MERS is shown below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted primarily through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through contaminated surfaces.
The virus was also found in saliva, suggesting that it may have passed from the saliva into the mouth.
A recent study of 138 patients showed that 41% of patients were not infected with hospital-acquired infections, including 17 patients with underlying conditions and 40 physicians or nurses.
Therefore, we need to take strong measures to protect people - especially doctors, health-care workers, family members, friends, and even neighbors who have had contact with those who have the disease.
The primary preventive measure that can help reduce the risk of infection is wearing a mask; the use of medical face masks and N95 (number# 1860s) respiratory masks will help to prevent the spread of the virus.
A medical mask prevents fluid from the infected person from escaping into the air or into objects, where it can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (number # 1860s) can protect against viruses even at 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of viruses can be fully infected; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Because the components can be contaminated by the combination of five medical mask types, contact physicians should wear N95 (number # 1860s) masks rather than medical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare professionals should wear appropriate face masks to reduce the chances of exposure to viruses.
Viruses can also infect the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have been transmitted through his sore eyes.
Therefore, doctors should wear a white mask or goggles when treating patients.
For all those who have been in contact with infected or potentially infected people, it is important that they all wash their hands with disinfectant soap more frequently than usual, stay home to self-quarantine and avoid contact with people who may be infected.
Two meters is the ideal distance for people to stay away from a sick person.
Taking these measures is an effective way to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the virus from spreading.
Although SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a new virus in the human world, its close similarity to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 should have alerted many in China as they are well aware of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, as of 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center reassured the public by stating that the new virus is not highly transmissible and has a low reproductive rate and is difficult to contain and control.
The news did not send a message to the people, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and they lost that crucial moment to stop the spread of the disease in Wuhan.
The Chinese Disease Control Association can learn from this mistake and make appropriate changes in the future.
For example, these organizations should (1) be more careful when speaking in public because community members trust them and can influence their behavior and decisions; (2) be more vigilant and more open to hospital information than to waiting for reports from doctors or authorities; (3) take stronger action to combat disease in its early stages rather than seeking to pacify the public; and (4) develop meaningful and effective strategies to help people understand the risks of disease and to identify and respond to such risks.
The emergence of the COVID-19 from the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the world at the time of this writing.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and its symptoms are similar to those of COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has been characterized by a resurgence of SARS.
However, there are also significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important for the prevention of the disease and the recovery of patients.
COVID-19 affects more older adults than younger adults and more men than women, and is more severe and fatal in older adults than in younger adults.
SARS will cause more deaths than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
People with COVID-19 transmit the virus even when they are asymptomatic but people with SARS transmit the virus only when they are severely ill, making it very difficult to prevent COVID-19 from spreading beyond SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 is more widespread and localized than SARS-CoV.
If we perform a normal SARS-CoV-2 RNA assay, it is likely that no other individuals will be infected with COVID-19.
However, the virus can reappear in people who have recovered.
These factors greatly increase the risk of viral transmission.
To ensure that COVID-19 research progresses as quickly as possible, there are a number of key areas that need to be improved, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 originate?
Although 96% similarity has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and the two SARS CoVs from bats, it is not yet possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What animals did the virus pass from when it moved from its natural habitat, namely bats, to humans?
Until we know the answers to questions #1 and 2, we cannot stop it from spreading, and it could reappear at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, do we really know how the virus enters the cells of the upper respiratory tract and causes mutations?
Does the virus also interact with ACE2 in other organ cells?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot know what is the best and most effective treatment.
How long will this disease last?
How does the virus grow in the bloodstream of humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it end as SARS or will it become a recurrent flu?
It is important but it can take a long time to get answers to the above questions and many more.
But whatever it costs us, the only thing we can do is to stop the disease as soon as possible and get our lives back on track.
Human coronavirus originated from animals
Mutation and adaptation have been the basis for the evolution of coronavirus (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for many years.
Prior to 2003, two human co-ovirus (HCoVs) were known not to cause severe illness, such as the common cold.
The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has highlighted the potential for human infection and death from HCoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in late 2019 has put CoVs in the foreground and has surprised us in their rapid spread but decreased infectivity as they are more virulent than their cousin SARS-CoV.
HCoV infections are zoonotic and identifying the source animals of HCoVs will also help us.
Most HCoVs are derived from bats but do not cause disease.
Intermediate carriers of other HCoVs have also been identified.
Identifying the animal vectors has a significant impact on the control of human disease.
Identifying the interactions between CoV carriers in animals may also be of great help in diagnosing CoV disease in humans.
In this article, we will briefly review what we know about seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of their discovery and their origin in animals and the materials that facilitate their transmission.
The key is that we compare and differentiate many HCoVs based on viral replication patterns and genome assembly.
The current 2019 CoV disease (COVID-19) is discussed in this article.
It also discusses the requirements for successful genetic modification and its role in viral development and progression.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which includes a group of highly active RNA viruses.
Viruses with large genomes of 26 to 32 kilobases in viral RNA were named CoVs because they were crown-shaped in the electron microscope.
In their body, CoVs do not have a uniform genome sequence.
About two-thirds of the genome is composed of two open strands (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated between pp1 and pp1ab by proteins.
Many of these proteins are also used to produce the 16-nuclear protein nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for the body of proteins, including the spleen (S), epidermis (E), membrane (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
A few specific proteins are also encoded by different classes of CoVs.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four main lines (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), and beta-CoVs are more commonly associated with HCoVs and are further subdivided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Genetic evidence suggests that bats and mice are the genetic source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main source of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
Over the millennia, CoVs have often crossed drug boundaries and some have become potent human viruses.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
The virus is transmitted by the virus that causes the disease.
The remaining five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 are generally associated with mild symptoms, such as cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 are more aggressive, causing severe lower respiratory tract obstruction in many patients who are at increased risk of developing respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other respiratory infections.
The first detection of HCoV-229E, B814, was in nasal secretions from patients with a common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, several studies have been conducted to identify HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which are less symptomatic.
Indeed, many people believed that HCoVs were harmless until the outbreak of SARS.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is one of the most deadly epidemics of modern times, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing nearly 10% of the population.
Within a decade, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) had become a major epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula and had spread to a small extent around the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), also known as SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 as of March 3, 2020.
A global alert has been issued and the world is preparing for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs are of animal origin, i.e. bats, mice, or other domestic animals.
The evidence suggests that all HCoVs originate from bats, where the viruses are highly resistant and have a wide range of host strains.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created a significant challenge for the medical, scientific, social and cultural communities of China and the world.
Tracking the animals from which HCoVs originate helps to understand the history of creation, the driving forces and the constraints that guide the organisms.
It may also lead or assist in the identification of the location, transit and recovery of the organisms that contain the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the efforts needed to contain its spread in the future.
In this article we briefly discuss the origin of the species, how it is transmitted by other organisms and the HCoVs.
In particular, we are emphasizing and discussing the important fact that the major HCoV viruses do not cause disease in their host environment but become pathogenic when they are transferred from an organism to a new host.
We also discussed how HCoVs evolve and how frequent transmission reduces their infectivity.
The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also discussed in this article.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first detection of HCoV-229E, B814, in the nasal urine of people with influenza, CoVs had already been transmitted to many animals, including turkeys, mice, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
In recent years, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief description of the HCoV discovery in this series (Table 1) will be useful and informative.
HCoV-229E was first isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with a foot-related respiratory illness in 1966, and later developed in WI-38 leptospirosis cells.
Patients with HCoV-229E had a high frequency of symptoms of fever and cough, sore throat, sore throat, sore throat, and sore throat with fever and cough observed in 10~20% of the population.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 emerged from tissue cultures and passed into the lungs of mice that ate the soil.
It has been observed that the symptoms of HCoV-OC43 are similar to those of HCoV-229E, which is highly similar to common respiratory tract infections, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed, and are usually transmitted during the winter months.
The two most commonly active viruses are less than a week apart, after which the infection lasts for about 2 weeks.
According to a free human trial, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E have a higher incidence of cold.
Only a few patients with poor health were found to have severe respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as mumps disease, was the first novel HCoV to cause a pandemic in human history and is derived from SARS-CoV, the third HCoV identified by humans.
The first reported case of SARS was reported in 2002 in Guangdong province, China.
SARS infection has infected 8,096 people and caused 774 deaths, spreading to many countries and continents.
In addition to the delivery of the drug, it was found that each recipient could pass the drug to at least two other people, with a half-life of 4-7 days and a maximum of 10 days after receipt.
People infected with SARS-CoV, initially experience muscle pain, fever, sore throat, and chills, followed by shortness of breath, coughing, and respiratory distress.
Lymphocyte depletion, renal dysfunction, and elevated creatine kinase are among the most common symptoms of SARS.
Alveolar degeneration, premature release of epithelial cells and increased macrophage growth are also seen in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of those infected will enter the intensive care unit and will require ventilation support.
Also downstream of the respiratory tract, many organs such as the digestive system, liver and kidneys can be damaged if the disease is severe, often causing a buildup of cytokines, which can be fatal in people with poor health.
The virus was first detected in a sample of the saliva of a relative of the infected man who had travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, much effort has been made to investigate HCoVs.
HCoV-NL63 was detected in a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was previously thought to be more common in young people, the elderly, and patients with poor health and respiratory problems.
Nasal symptoms, conjunctivitis, fever, and respiratory illness are common in infections caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another study reported that the same virus was isolated from nasal secretions from an 8-month-old boy with a foot-and-mouth disease in the Netherlands.
Even in the country-bas, it was widely distributed.
HCoV-NL63 appears to cause about 4.7% of all respiratory illnesses, with most cases occurring in the early summer, rainy season, and winter months.
HCoV-NL63 also causes laryngitis pneumoniae, also known as croupe.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was identified in a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to bronchiolitis and bronchial infections, HCoV-HKU1 has also been associated with severe asthma.
As with HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was detected globally, and has been implicated in human respiratory infections.
All four HCoVs are highly resistant to humans and are generally considered less likely to cause severe disease, although there has been an accidental and unknown cause in rare cases of a strain of HCoV-NL63 that has recently been reported to cause mild respiratory infections in China.
In general, when HCoVs that are highly transmissible in humans and persist in the human population, they are less susceptible or less virulent.
MERS-CoV was first identified in 2012 in the lung of a 60-year-old patient with severe lung and kidney disease in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases were from the Middle East, it has spread to other populations due to occasional contacts in many European countries and Tunisia.
A smaller outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 cases.
Symptoms of MERS are similar to those of SARS, but are more common in severe respiratory illness.
Unlike SARS, most MERS patients also had severe renal impairment, which is not the same as MERS in other HCoV infections.
More than 30 patients had symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders, including diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 cases of active cases and 34.4% of deaths were reported, making MERS-CoV one of the most deadly viruses.
Towards the end of December 2019, cases of respiratory illness with previously known SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infection a public health emergency of global concern and named it COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases had been reported worldwide, with a mortality rate of 3.4%.
Significantly, the death rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, compared to the overall figure of 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory illness such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV; it is characterized by fever, cough and respiratory distress.
Some patients also had diarrhea.
Lung disease is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly turn into severe respiratory illness.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar in their nucleotide abundance of 82%, they are divided into several subgroups of disease.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less virulent but more transmissible in humans when it is closely related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been detected in asymptomatic individuals and may have contributed to its rapid global spread.
Comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 and six other HCoVs reveal similarities and differences that are particularly interesting.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the disease are almost identical.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 is similar in many respects to the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms associated with COVID-19 is similar to that of SARS-CoV and four other HCoVs (e.g., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
In some cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes symptoms that are commonly seen in human HCoVs, including unusual, mild, or no symptoms at all.
In some cases, a small number of people with severe COVID-19 may be diagnosed with SARS-CoV infection, although the number is somewhat lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows similar patterns to the human HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
In addition, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is much higher than that of the HCoVs found in humans.
In addition, it is necessary to further investigate whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is decreasing after infection with humans as was the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the saliva.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been transmitted to humans through saliva, the significance of the SARS-CoV response is significant and further research is needed to better understand this in the future.
It is of particular interest whether SARS-CoV-2 can be induced by the seasonal processes that occur in HCoVs that infect humans.
However, some features of SARS-CoV-2 and its transmission, emergence and subsequent transmission to humans will influence the spread of COVID-19.
All HCoVs present in humans produce small, adaptive pathogens that are specific to humans.
In some ways, it is also possible that humans are susceptible to all four HCoVs.
In other words, both can be resistant to HCoV pandemics and can survive.
HCoVs that have infected humans with severe infection and those that have had severe HCoV infection, have been cleared of infection.
To do this, HCoVs must replicate in mature individuals so that new ones can emerge to overcome the environmental constraints.
Thus, the longer SARS-CoV-2 is present and the more people are infected, the greater the chance of its transmission to humans.
If it is well-controlled, it is unlikely to be transmitted through quarantine or other modes of transmission.
For many years, four infectious CoVs have been circulating in humans, causing colds in people with a high resistance to the virus.
These viruses do not need to be hidden in animals.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and the more common MERS-CoV are not adapted to human populations and are not in any way effective at controlling their spread in humans.
It will have to remain and spread among animals and seek out contact with humans, usually through one or more of the most viable carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar symptoms to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four other human-transmitted HCoVs.
It is as transmissible as human-infected HCoVs, at least for now.
However, it is more transmissible than the human-infected HCoVs but less transmissible than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Whether it will become accustomed to human contact and will move through people without a carrier or a transport animal remains to be seen.
Before discussing the origin of HCoVs, it is useful to discuss their characteristics and development, biology, habitat, transport and factors that make them potentially HCoVs.
The animal is the host for HCoVs that are susceptible to mutation by a highly specific nucleotide-dependent ancestor.
The virus is highly adaptable and does not transmit disease to its host.
Similarly, a single HCoV carrier is susceptible to long-term storage.
In both cases, the host is infected with the HCoV and its suitable host environment or with the virus that produces it.
However, once HCoVs are introduced into a suitable host before or shortly after human exposure, they do not adapt well to the new environment and often cause disease.
This secondary host may be a human pathogen and contributes to its virulence by allowing the virus to reproduce and then enter the human body and spread as it infects many people.
HCoVs can cause infectious disease if they cannot be prevented from spreading to the secondary host.
However, HCoVs can also adapt to secondary environments and even survive in secondary environments.
In this case, the secondary habitat becomes its ideal habitat.
The outbreak data showed that people with SARS had a long history of contact with pets.
Studies of the pathogenicity of the virus indicate that the animal population is more susceptible to SARS-CoV IgG than the general population.
The animal civet (Paguma larvata) and a vivverin dog in a live animal market, were first found to be infected with SARS-CoV-like viruses that are very similar to SARS-CoV.
They supported this because they found that other SARS had emerged after killing all the civets in the markets.
However, it is believed that the masked palm civet from the wild or farmed without being fed to live animal markets is not SARS-CoV positive, suggesting that these civets may be a secondary host to the SARS-CoV virus rather than its primary host.
Interestingly, since 80% of the animals in the Guangzhou markets have antibodies against SARS-CoV, it can be assumed that some of the microorganisms are secondary hosts for SARS-CoV viruses.
These are all endemic to SARS-CoV.
A study of animal hosts of SARS-CoV has shown a strong relationship with the bat CoV, called SARS Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-RhBatCoV HKU3), which is found in the Chinese horseshoe bat.
These bats have antibodies against SARS-CoV and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome.
These bats and CoVs have 88-92% of the same nucleotide sequence as SARS-CoV.
This research has helped to develop a new theory that bats are the carriers of human infectious diseases.
It is also found that most SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) originate from bats, but only WIV1 in total can be considered a living virus.
The human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the enzyme responsible for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 from bat droppings was used to demonstrate the use of bat, civet and human ACE2 as host to the invading cells.
Importantly, the serum of SARS survivors could have killed WIV1.
To date, WIV1 is the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV to bats, as it is 95% nucleotide-identical.
Although there is a strong relationship between the two viruses, it is generally accepted that WIV1 is not a secondary host for SARS-CoV and the kidneys are not a host for SARS-CoV.
The study of the relationship of MERS-CoVs in the same population with bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5
The CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV strains use a specific antigen, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), to replicate the virus.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence MERS-CoV is a small pathogen closely related to other bat-type beta-CoVs found in Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoV has been detected in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its close relative CoV-HKU25 have 87% nucleotide similarity.
Therefore, bats cannot be the primary host of MERS-CoV.
However, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedary camels are infected with MERS-CoV which kills the immune system, as are euta camels in the Middle East and in many African countries.
MERS-CoV is a homologue of the human virus, isolated from the nasal cavity of dromedary camels, suggesting that camels are the natural hosts of MERS-CoV.
It is also important because often mild but significant signs of viral transmission have been observed in camels that have been tested positive for MERS-CoV.
Importantly, infected camels not only spread the virus through the respiratory tract but also from the saliva to the mouth, which is also the route by which the virus is transmitted from bats to us.
However, questions remain as to whether most MERS cases were transmitted from camels prior to the outbreak, whether it was a human transmission or whether it was transmitted from unknown MERS-CoV-infected animals.
SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% nucleotide identical to the bat CoV RaTG13 that was isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are so profound that it is not possible to say that they are the same.
In other words, bats cannot host a second or more hosted SARS-CoV-2 unless we identify similar CoVs in the future.
It appears that the secondary host of SARS-CoV-2 must be among the wild animals that are traded and slaughtered in Huanan, the suspected source of most COVID-19 viruses, suggesting that it may have been transmitted from animals to humans.
A number of studies on metagenome suggest that a group of endangered animals called pangolins (Manis javanica) may be the ancestors of the beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of the new pangolin CoV share 85-92% of the same nucleotides as those of SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are very similar to RaTG13 in that they are 90% identical in terms of nucleotide levels.
Its group consists of two sub-groups of plant-derived SARS-CoV-2 viruses, which are identical in their source region (RBD) to SARS-CoV-2, 97.4% amino acid structure.
In stark contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very different, although they share a strong similarity at the genome level.
A previous study in dead pangolins found viral infections in the poison, and was similar to SARS-CoV-2.
This study uses alternative methods of recombinant therapy to produce a genome that is within 86.3% of the total viral genome length.
There is no denying that pangolins could be one of the secondary hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there has long been documented evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is actually derived from pangolins due to differences between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2 that resemble beta-CoVs.
In addition, the distances between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are much smaller than between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 derived from beta-CoVs.
The development of the SARS-CoV-2 pathway in bats, pangolins and some other animals has not been determined.
Although there is a strong relationship between RBDs and SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, the SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have substantially similar genomes.
It has been widely suggested that the strong similarity between pangolin RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is due to their highly divergent evolutionary patterns.
The idea is that there is a link between a pangolin-derived SARS-CoV-2 and a beta-CoV in RaTG13 in the fourth wild line.
The most common evolutionary mechanism, recombination occurs mainly in beta-CoVs.
The jury is still out on which animal is the source of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the infection caused by HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied for their animal origin.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E probably originated from bat CoVs, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses originated from rodents.
Reports indicate that the ARCoV.2 CoV bat (Appalachian Ridge CoV) has been detected in North America, and the three-colored bat was closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is similar to another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, but its secondary host was reported to be camelids.
For context, the current knowledge of the animal origin of HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis provides evidence that HCoVs have historically evolved from one organism and have been passed on to others.
When HCoV-OC43 was transmitted to humans from animals around 1890, it was thought to have caused a respiratory infection.
This article explains how HCoV-229E came from one organism and passed on to another is unclear.
The presence of the bat alpha-CoVs is thought to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
This includes one alpaca alpha-CoV.
Several studies have confirmed that the virus was transmitted from bats directly to humans.
First, bats were first encountered in their natural habitat by humans, not alpacas.
Nevertheless, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E- derived from bats, alpha-CoVs are different and do not cause disease in bats, whereas alpha-CoV alpaca caused respiratory infections in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpaca is not detected in animal faeces.
Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that alpacas have been exposed to HCoV-229E from alpha-CoV in humans.
Indeed, bats are the source of many viruses that infect humans, including the mouse virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats may have directly transmitted HCoV-229E to humans.
Alternatively, although the same alpha-CoVs in bats have been blood-feeding CoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels may be secondary hosts that carry the virus to humans, as was the case for MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good example of how the virus is transmitted from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolution of the MERS-CoV origin from bats is known as early as the discovery and subsequent observations have led to their confirmation.
Bats are known to carry a large number of viruses that are distributed across many species and species.
The ability to move, live in groups, have close contact and strong flight are all very good for bats to be a 'spreader' of viruses.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary camels for a long time.
The camel is so much a part of the camel that it is no longer its second home but a suitable and comfortable place for it.
MERS-CoV is a mildly pathogenic and highly transmissible strain in these animals.
Transmission to humans is a risk and people will continue to wear face masks as the spread of MERS-CoV cannot be monitored.
Unlike the role of camels in the spread of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic to pangolins.
They are a potential site of death for SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoVs, as are civets for SARS-CoV.
There is a high probability that SARS-CoV-2 will be transmissible from one organism to another, from animals to humans, but future studies will need to confirm this.
First, bats may host SARS-CoV-2 viruses that are very similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can be separated from bats by killing them or by mining them.
First, pangolins may be one of the second most vulnerable populations to SARS-CoV-2 in the near future.
Humans contract the virus by killing and eating animals.
It is possible that mammals and domestic animals may be infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Animal and wildlife research to produce antibodies is highly desirable.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that was exposed to bats and pangolins.
Research is ongoing to determine the origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to these possible animal species, three key features of this virus are also important in preventing CoVs from spreading to other organisms.
First, it is highly mobile and reproduces in RNA.
Unlike other RNA viruses, the circulation of CoVs can be considered as stable and stable and replicates at ~10-4 times per year in 2 locations, depending on how the CoV species adapt to its new environment.
CoVs have a number of exoribonucleases, which inactivation can cause them to multiply rapidly and reduce their potency or even prevent them from growing.
Interestingly, the key nucleotide of Remdesivir is known to inhibit the generation of CoVs by inhibiting both exoribonuclease and RNA-derived RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to be tested in humans.
However, the number of mutation CoVs is about one million higher than the number of regions in which they are found.
Furthermore, the mutation rate was usually high if the CoVs did not adapt to their new environment.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a higher mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2 appears to have a lower mutation rate, indicating that it is more transmissible to humans.
In a sense, it has adapted to another habitat that is closer to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV is also associated, which is well adapted to dromedary camels.
In short, it is because the genotype mutation will lead to the development of vaccines and therapeutics against the SARS-CoV-2 virus to weaken it.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs has some influence on mutation and replication, thus increasing its potential for replication, and is favorable for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions improve.
This is supported by the fact that the open and functional frames of the protein produce the 3 end of the genome.
Third, CoVs mutate randomly and often when they modify RNA through a complex process called copying.
The environment in which it lives and fuses is frequently altered during CoV RNA transcription.
Multiple identical RNAs and small genomes can be combined to produce novel CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of normal association has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, and in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
The interaction of the virus with the host virus in terms of its transmission
In addition to the three viral features mentioned above, the relationship of the virus to its environment is another important factor in how it spreads from one organism to another.
In it, the association of SARS-CoVs is presented as an example, and suggests that it transmits disease by contacting one organism and entering another organism.
Based on the comparative analysis of human and animal civet SARS-CoVs, it appears that SARS-CoV will continue to rapidly mutate in its host environment, particularly as it moves through the RBD of the S protein.
The RBD of the CoV S protein is usually associated with the host cell and is highly selective for the host antibody.
In SARS-CoV, RBD has a 318 to 510 amino acid sequence in the S1 domain, which interacts with human ACE2 and other viral entry sites.
The RBD of SARS-CoV can identify ACE2 receptors from many animals, including bats, civets, rats and wild dogs, allowing the virus to be transmitted from one organism to another.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found to be different from human and civet virus isolates from RBD and 4 of these with the receptor were found to be associated with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV civet has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, and this increases the interaction between the mosquito protein and the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, two amino acid substitutes may be essential for the virus to adapt to humans.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 is the same subtype as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 portion of the S protein indicates that the S protein's affinity to human ACE2 is mutagenic.
In fact, one cryo-EM study showed a 10- to 20-fold greater association than that between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be important to determine whether a secondary agent is required to spread SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but in a different S-type domain.
There are several other HCoV receptors, including aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetyl sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
It may also help to identify the extent to which CoVs are able to adapt to humans after an initial exposure to an animal.
In addition to the host cell, the effects of HCoVs from one organism to another are controlled by their interactions with other environments and their specific inhibitory factors.
The difference in the protein of the environments in which HCoVs live and the environments in which the hosts such as bats, dromedaries and rodents are found may be a factor in preventing their transmission from one organism to another.
HCoVs must be able to adapt to the host and modify the host's immune system to be able to migrate from one organism to another.
In this case, the molecular basis for the important relationship between the virus and its environment is still unknown and will require further investigation.
Efficient genome-dependent and inhibitory testing for SARS-CoV-2 using the advanced CRISPR method can be helpful.
New HCoVs emergence: a return to the basics
The variation of bat CoVs is a contributing factor to the emergence of new HCoVs.
In definition, bat CoVs are the source of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and gene association also contribute to HCoV proliferation and are two important steps in this process.
For example, the gain or loss of protein gene coding has the potential to dramatically alter the interactions between viruses.
In the SARS-CoV protein family, ORF8 appears to be important for human adaptation, as the SARS-CoV bat viruses, were isolated but found to be a different form of the ORF8 protein.
They found that they had eliminated the 29-nucleotide sequence of SARS-CoVs that had been isolated at the onset of the human epidemic.
This cleavage separates ORF8 from ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a factor that allows it to move from one site to another.
In addition, SARS-CoV can also associate with the alpha- and gamma-CoV sequences, where many subunits have been identified in RNA derived from polymerase RNA.
The compounds were also found in nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it appears that the MERS-CoV pandemic was shared among several strains, which were produced by dromedary camels of Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cross-links have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs have been associated with other animal CoVs with their genes.
Care should also be taken that selecting the false strain may lead to unintended genetic mutations in the host genome, and may render the host virus vulnerable to external threats, such as the immune response of the host.
An example of this is the complete loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype, which was caused by the loss of two nucleotides.
Although intact ORF4 was detected in bats and in camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV showed a single nucleotide increase, causing a frame reversal.
Last but not least, the development of new HCoVs is due to the influence of their environment.
No or only a few symptoms were observed when bats were infected with CoVs, suggesting an adaptation between CoVs and bats.
Bats appear to be anatomically and physiologically distinct from CoVs.
For example, improvements in the accuracy of the castration process in bats reduced the risk of CoVs.
In addition, the killer cells of the bats were killed by the activation of NKG2/CD94 and showed low levels of strict histocompatibility of class I molecular complexes.
In addition, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from the active metabolism of bats can kill CoV or produce it and influence its exoribonuclease-mediated relay, thus helping to select the most pathogenic strains when they are in a new environment.
Many CoV infections can also develop through recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or proteins to adapt to the host environment.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.
CoVs do not cause disease or cause minor symptoms in their host such as bats and camels.
It is usually contracted without the use of an immune system.
This is where the symptoms of people who are not symptomatic are detected and what causes the most severe symptoms.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by hyperactivation of the immune system and excessive cytokines in the area of the immune system, and result in severe lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic patients, the innate immunity to CoVs is double-acting.
Similar methods of eliminating the immune system may be effective against SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
Interferon is particularly effective against bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon even in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be highly effective.
Furthermore, induction of NLRP3 in inflammasome in bats is not effective.
Based on these hypotheses, stimulating NLRP3 in the inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is a direct consequence of the same factor that causes SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While the bat beta-CoV is found to have 95% of the same nucleotides as SARS-CoV, bat-CoVs have 96% of the same nucleotides as SARS-CoV-2.
Although civet and other animals in markets have been found to carry viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 host sites are similar.
Pangolin beta-CoVs appear to be highly similar to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolins may be a common host of these viruses or that pangolin beta-CoVs are involved in the gene sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 end-gen.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that the human-made SARS-CoV-2 is deliberate or accidental.
CoVs have been the focus of renewed attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has significantly changed our view of whether HCoVs originate from animals and are host animals before transmission to humans.
There is no conclusive evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through their host organisms.
Because SARS-CoV infection is caused by human-to-civet contact in markets, closing wildlife markets and killing the live civets could potentially stop the SARS outbreak.
In the same vein, pangolins should be removed from raw meat markets to prevent the transmission of the disease to humans, as there is evidence that several beta-CoVs from pangolins are associated with SARS-CoV-2.
However, future research will help determine whether humans have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 from monkeys and other animals.
In some cases, MERS-CoV has long been endemic in dromedary camels.
Camels play a vital role in transmitting the disease to humans, as do meat, milk, hides, and wool products to the local population.
It is widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore it is not possible to kill all camels to combat MERS, as was done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent further outbreaks of MERS, we need to conduct a robust research to develop a suitable vaccine for MERS-CoV in camels, and to implement other preventive measures against the disease.
While we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genomes can cause other diseases.
Many CoVs are circulating in the wild.
In particular, these animal CoVs can be expressed in a wide variety of ways.
There is a very high probability that these animal CoVs will reproduce and recombine, resulting in new CoVs that will be more widespread and/or lethal in the future.
The practice of eating wild fish in some parts of China is likely to end as people have less contact with animals.
As SARS, MERS and COVID-19 have plagued us, we must prepare and plan for their response.
Indeed, many viruses have been on our planet for centuries.
It stays in its place until it has a chance to emerge.
Although bats have many characteristics that contribute to the spread of these viruses, we can reduce human contact with bats and other wildlife by educating people to keep away from these animals.
Monitoring of the mammals is important to understand the nature of CoVs and their habitat, as well as to help prevent the transmission of these viruses from animals to humans and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the best way to prevent animal-borne viruses is to keep people away from areas where these viruses are found in wildlife.
The exact source of the animal SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown.
First, if bats have infected pangolins with the old SARS-CoV-2 virus, it would be useful to understand how bats and pangolins coexist.
Second, if bats directly transmitted the virus to humans, we need to know how humans came into contact with bats.
Third, if the third mammal is the second true host of the virus, it should be explained how it interacts with other organisms including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals and even domestic animals can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, it is also important to monitor and test for the disease.
It is rather bats, pangolins or other mammals, which are expected to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 or other closely related viruses, that will be identified in their future habitats.
Continued monitoring of these data may help to understand how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to animals, and this has important implications for the control and protection of humans against COVID-19.
Up-to-date information on the number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in the country is essential
On 6 February 2020, our organization published a safety advisory for the detection and treatment of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, which provides a comprehensive approach to the global pandemic.
However, with the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), our knowledge and understanding of it has gradually improved with the current available data and clinical tools; hence the diagnostic strategies and guidelines have been continuously updated.
In this post, we responded to a comment on our support and provided the latest criteria for the  suggested cases and  accepted cases in the following Final Diagnostic and Preventive Care for COVID-19 (version 7) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is now called acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO defined COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our organization has developed a supporting advisory package that is published online in the Army Medical Archives on February 6, 2020.
It has been widely read since its publication.
However, as COVID-19 emerges, our knowledge and understanding of it will gradually increase based on current evidence and clinical tools that are available; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies will be kept up to date.
The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) has published a diagnostic manual for COVID-19 in seven editions between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, with some of the contexts changing drastically.
As our support received a comment from Zhou et al., they developed a simplified method of assigning points based on their clinical experience.
Their work has increased the available evidence for support and has provided valuable information for the global pandemic.
We acknowledge their important work and express our gratitude to them.
However, their work also required additional support from the Diagnostic and Treatment Services for the COVID-19 (Test version VII) study.
In the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a case, the investigators may need to combine one section of epidemiological case history with two sections of clinical manifestations to make a full analysis, or may need to complete three sections of clinical manifestations if no epidemiological data are available:
Epidemiological information: (1) reports of travel to or residence in Wuhan and adjacent areas, or other locations of cases of COVID-19 reported more than 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (2) reports of contact in case of SARS-CoV-2 (positive nucleic acid test); (3) reports of contact in case of fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and surrounding areas or other locations where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (4) reports of contact in case of endemic disease (≥ 2 confirmed cases with fever/respiratory symptoms in less than 2 weeks in small areas, e.g. office, school, n.b.).
Clinical manifestation: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with symptoms of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total white blood cell count is normal, decreased, or the lymphocyte count decreased in the early stages.
A confirmed case diagnosis should include a case suspected by at least one of the following key components or serological evidence: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) whole-genome sequence showing increased homogeneity with newly identified coronaviruses; (3) positive for IgM specific antibodies and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a change in IgM for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies from negative to positive, or a ≥4-fold increase in titer in the case recovery phase on the songe.
Note that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid by immunisation or blood sample was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and third edition (22 January 2020).
The blood sample quality assurance was added in the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020); and the serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
These changes in the detection rate followed the work that was done to find the most effective diagnostic tools for the optimal detection of nucleic acid, along with a sample of the immuno-antibody pathway within a blood sample, which led to the development of several hypotheses, and facilitated the recognition of the positive specific antibody results in the accepted tests.
In addition, there is increasing evidence that suggests we should isolate both atypical and asymptomatic patients.
For follow-up, the Zhou et al. graph should be kept up to date, as a person without clinical symptoms was assigned the position of a small riske.
The scoring system should also be verified by additional clinical tools and studies.
In conclusion, we hope that the evidence will be permanently amplified and that the reader will be able to give as much as he has seen.
For the diagnosis of cas considered  and accepted  tozo should follow and comply with the local diagnostic procedures from their countries.
Our team will also keep you updated as we develop our support to help.
Bangladesh reports three new COVID-19 deaths, the highest on any day
Yesterday, Bangladesh reported five new COVID-19 deaths in a single day.
This is the highest death rate from the virus.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Emergency, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported the number of infected patients at 114 and 33 in the home recovered.
17 people died.
In online media, the Director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the dead were two men and two women.
For Dr. Meerjady, two are 60 years old, two are between 51 and 60, and one is between 41 and 50.
He also said that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 January.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, the local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, the director of the Kotelema-Mobiba commission, who was in the Kuwait Maitree hospital.
On Saturday, in a video message posted online, Bangladesh's Minister of Transport Obaidul Quader said that buses will be closed for several days, including next Sunday.
The bus closure began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Carrying essential goods  medicines, fuel and food  may be carried.
The first cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh were on 8 March, in two patients from Italy and the wife of one of them.
On March 19, the three were rescued.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than one million people worldwide
As of Thursday, the number of cases of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease had exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins data.
52 deaths were due to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
This victory came the day Malawi and Zambia had their first cases of coronavirus.
North Korea reported on Thursday that it was the first country in the world to have no coronavirus cases.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 new cases and 79,332 cases as of 1 and 10 pm European Time (0800UTC) on 4 April 4.
In the United States, there have been more than 244 thousand cases of coronavirus, and 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reports that, following Johns Hopkins University, the coronavirus death toll was 1,000 on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have implemented strict policies to contain the spread of the virus.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the Mayor of Moscow, extended the lockdown to May 1.
In a national news release, President Vladimir Putin said that Russians will continue to receive their paycheck even if they do not go to work by April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the lockdown to 15 days; the vote passed by 215 votes to 10, with one abstention.
In Saudi Arabia, a lockdown was imposed on the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for the entire day; previously, the lockdown was only from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand has imposed a curfew from 10pm to 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state would impose a curfew until May 1.
The market in Australia has stopped counting how much paper a person can buy
On Sunday and Saturday, the Australian supermarket Woolworths and Coles introduced a policy of buying one or two paper bags from each store in the country.
ALDI also set a single rule for the first day.
The rules were written in a letter outside their boutique and on their Facebook page.
People were buying in large numbers due to the fear that COVID-19 could cause people to be confined to their homes.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also introduced rules on home delivery services and paper machines.
The following four laws were just as effective at Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March.
Coles, in his March 8 news release, said that the four-person rule was in effect, but some products are sold out within an hour of being released and called the demand to be higher, while ALDI, on Facebook on Tuesday called it to be higher.
Sales rose sharply last week, according to a Woolworths representative.
Butik of Costo a Canberra also finished second in the last race.
To satisfy the anxiety of running out of supplies, Coles ordered more, Woolwoths ordered more, AlDI ordered more Wednesdays' supplies that were going to be needed days ahead.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are raising prices, but the country's laws are causing them great concern.
The idea that the productivity of the population must increase to satisfy the demands of the people.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the release of the previous day's specials, some stores will not be offering the Wednesday special.
In a news.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a senior marketing researcher at Queensland University of Technology, said that the store is catering to everyone.
He found that paper was a bulky substance, so it would be absorbed by the mucus, and would be quickly removed, leaving the store empty, which would increase the risk of waste.
"Coles and Woolworths are right that if there were more items in the stores, if things like toilet paper and hand sanitizer could be bought in bulk, the price would drop", says Russell Zimmerman of ABC News.
The paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap says they were out of stock last Wednesday.
Kimberly-Clark, a maker of Kleenex paper, and Solaris paper maker Sorbent, said they are on a 24/7 call to meet demand, following news.com.au's report.
Domain.com, a housing service, said that some homeowners were offering free rentals to the first person to bid on a property, when people were buying less because they had nothing to do on the weekend.
The Thursday edition of the NT News, Darwin's reading magazine, contained eight pages of paper that people could cut to help with the paper-printing process.
Before the government was willing to impose restrictions, ABC Australia reported on March 3 that it did not want to limit the amount of food that people could buy.
Russell Zimmerman noted that there is also a growing demand for other items, such as masks, sanitary products, dry food, hand sanitizers, and flour.
And, outside Australia, on Sunday at the Ocado supermarket in England it was found that people were buying less Andre's paper towels per two packs of 12.
World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current outbreak of COVID-19  The disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus  to be a pandemic.
Although the name pandemi refers to the longevity of the disease, not its severity, WHO recognized the need for governments to take action:
All countries can stop this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, assist, impose quarantine and follow up and join forces to fight, " said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO.
We are terrified of how it spreads and how nothing is happening.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the United States, pandemics are "miracles".
He said that, according to a CNN report in February, "except for influenza, no other respiratory illness has had a similar global impact or spread".
Ghebreyesus also said, "We have not yet seen a pandemic like the one we saw with the coronavirus".
He added, and we will never see a pandemic that can be stopped.
The pandemic designation is based on the WHO's decision in January to declare it a global public health emergency.
Dr. Anthony Fauci of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said "the situation could get worse".
On Thursday, the United Nations reported that of the 126,000 cases of COVID-19 in the world, 4,600 had died.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is the pandemic of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by the respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The disease was identified in Whuhan, China, in December 2019, became a public health emergency on January 30, 2020, and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, there were 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 in 210 countries and territories, resulting in 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people survived.
The mortality rate is 4% in China, the global rate is 13.04% in Algeria and .08% in New Zealand.
Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications include pneumonia, difficulty breathing.
If the disease is present, it will take five to twelve days for symptoms to appear.
There is no known vaccine or cure.
First, they will diagnose symptoms and help you recover. To prevent infection, you should wash your hands, cover your nose or mouth if you cough, stay away from people, and be aware of those who are in quarantine because they were in contact with an infected person.
Governments around the world have imposed road closures, curfews, curfews, workplace safety equipment, and lockdowns.
The pandemic has exposed the world's economic woes, the slowing or cancellation of sports, churches, political and recreational activities, and the shortage of goods in the world due to the explosive excess of consumerism.
Schools and universities have been closed globally or partially in 193 countries, affecting 99.4 percent of the student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread across the internet, and xenophobia is most evident in the hatred of Chinese, and East and Southeast Asian peoples and their neighbours, and those in areas where the virus is endemic.
After road closures, carbon in the atmosphere is reduced.
Officials in Wuhan, China (the largest city of Hubei province) detected a new outbreak of pneumonia on 31 December 2019, and a study was initiated to diagnose it in early January 2020.
The infected individuals were from the Huanan Zoo and the virus is believed to be zoonotic.
The virus that causes the disease is called SARS-CoV-2, a novel virus derived from the bat coronavirus, the papillomavirus and SARS-CoV. The first symptomatic case was reported on 1 December 2019, and it is unknown whether the patient was from that region.
Of those infected in 2019, more than half were identified as marketers.
On 13 March 2020, a report from South China in the Morning Post reported that the outbreak began on 17 November 2019, with a 55-year-old man in Hubei. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that cases had declined in China but had started to rise in Italy, Iran and South Korea, where cases surpassed those in China.
It may be that we don't know how many people are infected among those with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, the overall infection rate was younger, with 2.4% of the population aged 19 years and younger.The head of the UK's National Science Foundation, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the population in Brittany would need to be infected for the virus to be transmitted.
The number of cases is the number of people with COVID-19 who have tested positive, the law states.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have introduced a policy of not testing people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March in China and 23 February found that 86% of COVID-19 cases were unidentified, and they were responsible for the spread of the disease in 79% of those identified.
A press release issued on 30 March found that the number of cases in Italy was higher than previously reported.
The prevalence of (R0) COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A recent estimate from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests a 5.7 percent chance.
Most people who have contracted COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who do not recover, the time between symptoms and death is 6 to 41 days, with a maximum of 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, 97,000 people had died from COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, 80% of those who died were 60 years or older, and 75% had other health conditions such as heart disease and diabetes.Those who died from COVID-19 were those who tested positive for COVID as required by the regulations.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be higher, but it does not include untested cases  such as, home, nursing home, and more.
A preliminary study from Italy found that the number of deaths from COVID-19 was 4-5 times higher than previously thought.
A U.S. official from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that Or know that (local mortality rate) is incorrect because it is too low, according to U.S. reports. Such low mortality rates are common in pandemics, such as in the 2009 pandemic of H1N1 swine fever. The first death in Wuhan was on 9 January 2020.
The Chinese death was on 1 February in the Philippines, and the Asian death was on 14 February in France.
As of February 28, apart from China, more than a dozen people have died in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, forty countries had reported cases of the disease, in every continent except Antarctica. A number of efforts are underway to determine the exact number of deaths.
These rates vary widely, and follow current testing, as well as clinical and treatment patterns, the time since the outbreak began, and other population-based factors such as age, gender, and health status. Mortality rates amongst the rates of infection are among the highest.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall mortality rate was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number of the table.
In China, the death rate among those with the disease is 17.3% (for those with symptoms on January 1 to January 10, 2020) and 0.7% (for those with symptoms on February 1, 2020). Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of cases and deaths, and the case fatality rate (IFR) which is the percentage of cases (based on the test) and deaths from the disease.
These statistics are not hourly, but are based on the trends in the world and in the population.
Many academics have tried to find these limits for large populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Vaccines has found that the mortality rate is between 0.1% and 0.39
The above figure is one of Germany's COVID-19 statistics, and the statistical data will be based on CFR tests.
WHO has declared this pandemic to be controllable.
The duration of the pandemic is uncertain and varies from place to place
According to Maciej Boni of Penn State University, If not properly treated, the disease can become more severe when its natural habitat is lost.
But there is no way to know how it will be.
The Chinese government's chief of staff Zhong Nanshan said the outbreak could be stopped by June if all countries follow WHO recommendations on how to control the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine reported that SARS-CoV-2 would be circulating for one to two years.
A study by Imperial College Neil Ferguson, found that social distancing and other restrictions are necessary for the time it takes to get vaccinated (it can take 18 years or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University says, "I don't know if it's a coronavirus, because it's so easily forgotten, it's gone forever, and it can become a disease that comes and goes, it can come back every year".
Its return rate depends on how well the human body can resist it and whether it is overheated.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be quite severe and may not be recognized by people who are infected.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Minor symptoms such as weakness, respiratory distress, hearing loss, shoulder fracture, joint pain, engine pain, headache, cold with tremors, hemoptysis, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO estimates that one in six people will experience severe illness and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified serious symptoms such as respiratory distress, chest pain or chest pain, loss of consciousness, difficulty walking, dizziness; emergency medical care is required if these symptoms are present. Additional illnesses may include pneumonia, respiratory infections, sepsis, and death.
Some infected individuals may have no symptoms, with no symptoms but with tests that indicate the disease, so the researchers suggest that those who were close to those who tested positive should be evaluated.
China says as many as 44% of people are asymptomatic.
The incubation period (duration of infection and onset of symptoms) is one to 14 days; the average is five days.As a result, the proportion of people with COVID-19 who experienced significant loss of consciousness decreased from 30% to 15%.
The mechanism by which the disease spreads is well known.
It is believed that the virus is spread by contact with people and by small droplets that are produced when someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks; the distance is 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 ft).
Studies have found that the average length of a sperm whale is 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some suggest that the virus can also be spread by tiny body fluids remaining in the air for long periods of time, which occurs when a person speaks. Respiratory fluids and when a person is breathing, and walking, are not airborne.
Water droplets can escape from the nose or eyes of people who are nearby, and can be inhaled.
Inserting a tube into a syringe for Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause the airways to expand inside the body.
It can also be spread by contact with the skin, and by contact with the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Some say it can walk through the mud, but this one is just a little scared.
The Chinese government denies that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through mosquitoes. The virus is most isolated in the first three days after symptomatic onset, but can be transmitted asymptomatically in the last days of the virus.
The human infection has been detected within three days of infection, which suggests that the disease is contagious if the person is asymptomatic.
Only a few laboratory studies have shown that asymptomatic cases have been reported but that asymptomatic cases have been found in other countries when following close contacts of infected individuals.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECD) says that it is not known exactly how the disease is spread, but one person can spread it to two or three people.The virus can survive for long hours on surfaces.
Because, the virus has been detected on plastic (polypropylene) for up to three days and on 304 steel, for one day on cardboard, and for four days on copper.
However, this depends on the temperature of the environment. Dogs and other pets can be infected with COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but UK authorities have warned that people should wash their hands after touching animals, as well as after touching infected skin.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel, early-stage infection that was first isolated from patients with pneumonia or respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All new SARS-CoV-2 strains are produced in the environment. Outside of the human body, the virus can survive on soap and then be destroyed. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the SARS-CoV family.
It is said that it can replace animals.
Genetic analysis has identified coronaviruses in the genus Betacoronaviruses, in the genus Sarbecovirus (genus B) and in two species of bats.
It is 96% identical to the genome of this bat-derived coronavirus (batCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, a Chinese study found that the only difference was a single amino acid in some parts of the human genome of the smallpox virus.
The entire genome has been identified in 92% of the human ancestors of both the coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which does not suggest that the disease is ancestral.
Post-viral infection may be detected in the presence of symptoms, but diagnosis for this diagnosis should be made by internal polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of the infected areas in CT imaging.
It is difficult to see what differentiates PCR from CT in Wuhan, as CT is more sensitive than PCR, but it is less sensitive, as more images are seen in pneumonia and other diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology advised that CT is not recommended for newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients.
WHO published manuscripts of several RNA tests for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test has been used to detect the nature of the polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done with a swab or a blood test.
The results will be announced in the next few hours or days.
However, these tests are designed to detect the presence of nasal mucus and throat.Many laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been found to be authentic due to the large number of users.
In the US a serological test product developed by Cellex is approved for emergency use only for laboratory use.
Radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans of asymptomatic patients have shown a spike in blood clotting and a lack of blood coagulation.
The Italian Radio Society is working on a website to view images of people who are sick.
Because it is associated with many diseases such as adenovirus, the resulting lack of detection in PCR is a significant factor in the detection of COVID-19.
A large Chinese study that looked at breast CT and PCR suggested that the vaccines were too slow, slow and ineffective, to be considered effective in fighting the pandemic.
Artificial scans to detect the presence of the virus in the nervous system in the human being by radiography or CT scans.
Actions to prevent the spread of ys disease include proper hygiene, hand washing, avoiding touching the face, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or itching in clothing and immediately discarding it in the trash.
Those who may be infected should wear masks when outside the home.
Social distancing is also recommended.Many governments have suspended or restricted non-essential travel in pandemic areas.
However, the virus has become a global public health hotspot.
This means that the virus is spreading between people in the community, and some communities don't know how or where they got sick. Healthcare professionals who treat patients should follow the advice of social distancing and surveillance. Social surveillance is essential to identify the source of the disease and to control it.
The government has threatened to block access to the phone, Amnesty International and 100 other organisations for their human rights violations.
Many mobile applications are designed for healthcare, as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen students were working on social security, such as enabling Bluetooth to track how close people are to other phones.
Afterwards, people will receive a message that they have been in close contact with a person with COVID-19. Information on how to prevent infection, such as rinsing the nose and cleaning the mouth with a mouthwash, is not accurate.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, but many organizations are working to make it available.
Hand washing is essential to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, after going to the toilet or if their hands are dirty; before eating; and after blowing their nose, coughing, and sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus can be washed with household soap, which will dissolve its hiding place.
The CDC also recommends that handwashing with a product containing 60% more alcohol than soapy water is not recommended.
WHO recommends that people stop touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The concentrations can be in the form of a solution (in one minute of exposure to the metal), 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochloride, 0.5% hygrogen peroxide, and 0.2%-7.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chroxedine gluconate, are less potent.
The CDC recommends that if a person with COVID is seen in a hospital or suspected of having COVID, as well as in the workplace, a child's classroom, any area such as a bathroom, seating area, shared electronics, screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines that the patient touches, should be cleaned.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a handkerchief or cloth when coughing or sneezing, and dispose of it promptly.
Hospital masks are recommended for those who are sick, as wearing a mask may block the passage of fluid when speaking, itching or coughing.
WHO has issued guidelines for when to wear masks.
Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, says Wearing a mask can prevent people from touching the face, which is a major cause of infection. Mask can also be worn by a person who is treating a potentially infected person.
WHO recommends that healthy people should only wear masks if they are at risk of infection, such as those caring for a person with COVID-19, but also considers it important that people avoid touching their faces.
Many communities have now required people to wear masks outside the home.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of disposable face masks.China recommends disposable face masks for people who are not infected, especially if they are within 1 meter (3ft) or less of other people.
Hong Kong has asked people to wear medical masks when traveling on buses or in crowded areas.
Health authorities in Thailand have asked people to wear a face mask at home and wash it daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have introduced regulations that prohibit people from going outside without wearing a face mask.
On 16 March, Vietnam required all citizens to wear masks when outdoors to protect themselves and their loved ones.
The Australian government has required that everyone entering the market wear a face mask.
Israel requires people to wear masks when they are outside the house.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks a day since mid-March, required all passengers on trains and buses to wear masks as of 1 April.
Panama has introduced a mandatory mask requirement for outdoor use, and has also introduced the option of making homemade face masks for those who cannot afford to buy a mask.
Masks are widely used in Japan, South Korea and Malaysia as well as in Singapore.
Social distancing (or social isolation) is a prevention of disease that can stop the spread of disease and reduce social cohesion.
Other measures include quarantines; road closures; and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, and large shopping malls.
Social distancing can be helped by staying at home, avoiding traffic, avoiding public places, avoiding contact with others, and staying away from people.
Many governments are implementing social distancing measures in areas of high infection.
The US government says that the number of people allowed to be in a church can be limited to 250 or fewer (if COVID-19 is not detected in the community) or 50, and then they say 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned social gatherings of 2 or more people. Modern and young people with certain medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and a weak immune system may be at higher risk of severe infection. The CDC recommends staying home in areas where there is an outbreak. At the end of March 2020, the WHO and other health authorities have recommended Stay Away and Stay Away, to suggest social distancing but not online or offline contact.
The "stay away" policy says people should talk to each other, but should talk to each other if possible.Some governments have introduced social distancing measures in response to the pandemic.
It is safe to only have sex with a person who is not infected or symptomatic.
Home quarantine is recommended for those with COVID-19 and those suspected of having it.
Health facilities have been providing adequate quarantine.Many governments have imposed or recommended mandatory quarantine in affected areas.
Strict quarantine rules have been imposed for those who are susceptible to infection.
Those who have been in close contact with a person with COVID-19 and who have traveled from areas or regions with a high incidence of the disease should remain in quarantine for 14 days.
A means of preventing the spread of the virus that stops or slows or slows it down.
Early-stage containment of the outbreak includes monitoring and quarantining of infected individuals and conducting interventions that delay the disease and administering vaccines to individuals to reduce disease in the population.
When it becomes difficult to contain the spread of the disease, the cost becomes: to reduce the spread of the virus in the community.
The process of elimination can be done in parallel.
Mitigation requires more work to be done to reduce the spread of the disease to humans.1. Disease control is the process of slowing the spread of a pandemic, called pandemic mitigation.
This reduced the risk of overcrowding in healthcare settings and allowed time for a vaccine and vaccine to be developed.
Non-hospital measures that can help prevent infection include hand washing, mask wearing, quarantine; mandatory social distancing measures such as school closures and restrictions on large gatherings; mandatory consent to these measures; and a strict curfew. Further stringent measures were introduced in China when the threat became too great, with a city-wide quarantine and road closures.
Some countries have introduced regulations to control the virus.
South Korea has begun mass testing and has established quarantines, and restricted movement.
Singapore has given money to those who have been put under quarantine and has imposed sanctions on those who have not.
Taiwan has been slow to produce masks and has launched a campaign against those who have been collecting masks in large quantities. The British and American experience has shown that (push back but stop the spread of the pandemic) has been very strong in terms of (push back the pandemic).
The final rule could help hospital staff by reducing the number of people going to the hospital by two-thirds and halving the number of deaths and injuries among hospital staff.
A lockdown can be effective but should only be continued as long as the virus is still present in humans (or until a vaccine is available), so that the spread can resume if people do not go beyond the lockdown guidelines.
Long-term measures to contain the pandemic will have a cost to the economy and the economy.
There is no cure for COVID-19, but there is a practical application, and testing of existing treatments.
Taking pharmacy cough medication, drinking fluids, and getting enough sleep can help with symptoms.
If it is severe, oxygen therapy, intravenous administration, and respiratory support may be helpful.
The use of steroids can be dangerous.
Many of the symptoms have been approved for treatment with vaccines and some viral infections are being studied for treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also suggested that alternative local and home remedies could help alleviate the symptoms of SARS-CoV-19.
The increase and decrease in the number of hospitals for COVID-19 patients is a key issue in the WHO's response.
ECDC and WHO's European office have developed guidelines for clinical practice to address the needs of other healthcare settings, such as laboratory COVID-19 testing, preventing the need for additional patient care, quarantining or isolation of COVID-19 patients, and increasing the availability of care by providing bedsores and bed ventilators.
There are many terms in the origin of this first patient (known as patient zero).
The first case of the novel coronavirus is believed to have occurred on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In one month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei increased dramatically.
They were people on the streets of Huanan market, who also sold live animals, and one claimed the virus originated from these animals; others said it was wild or zoonotic.Many people were diagnosed with pneumonia on 26 October and were treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, he told the Jianghan CDC in Wuhan on 27 October.
On 30 December, a team of doctors at Wuhan City Hospital reported that a new strain of SARS-CoV-2 virus was circulating.
Eight priests, including Li Wenliang, were arrested by the police for speaking against the priest, and Ai Fen was suspended by his superiors for causing the incident.
The Wuhan Regional Health Commission released the report on 31 October and informed WHO.
Most cases of pneumonia were reported to health workers in Wuhan for diagnosis in early January.In the early days of the outbreak, the number of cases rose sharply at seven to half a day.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other cities in China, supported by the New Year festival and the fact that Wuhan is a major transportation hub.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new cases per day, with two cases in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
After official data showed 6,174 people with symptoms as of 20 January 2020.As of 26 March, the United States has surpassed China and Italy as the country with the highest number of cases in the world.As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million people were infected worldwide; more than 97,000 had died and more than 364,000 had recovered.
I had 200 villages and one sick person.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have imposed travel restrictions and road closures.
People are placed in a national lockdown (also called a stay-at-home order, lockdown, or lockdown) and imposed curfews.As of 2 April, 300 million people, or 90% of the population, are under a similar lockdown in the United States, over 50 million people are under lockdown in the Philippines, over 59 million are under lockdown in South Africa, and 1.3 billion under lockdown in India.
As of 26 March, 1.7 billion tonnes of global quarantine capacity was in place, which pushed 2.6 billion people in the world just two days earlier to quarantine  the entire global population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, with some suggesting it could have been on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian identified several cases of pneumonia on 26 December, and then his hospital informed the Jianghan CDC in Wuhan on 27 December.
The first genetic tests for these patients were carried out on 27 December 2019 and detected the SARS-CoV-CoV variant.
The Wuhan Regional Health Commission issued the report on 31 November.
WHO also issued a statement on the same day.
While the tests were being conducted, the Wuhan doctors were forbidden by the police from making false statements about the accident.
The National Health Commission of China said that the disease is not transmitted between people without any indication.
In early January, the Chinese government launched a campaign that Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping called a "war on the spread of the virus".
In what has been called the "largest lockdown in the history of the world", the health campaign began on 23 January with the closure of routes into and out of Wuhan, covering 15 districts in Hubei, for a population of 57 million.
Private vehicles were banned in the city.
The Chinese New Moon Festival (January 25) was over.
The authorities also started building the huoshenshan hospital which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was later established, the leishenshan hospital, to treat the sick.
In addition to the new hospitals, China also developed 14 sites in Wuhan, including stadiums and community-based health centers. On 26 January, the government began monitoring the spread of COVID-19, and issued a travel ban for travelers during the Spring Festival.
Universities and colleges in the country were closed.
The communities in Hong Kong have introduced several regulations regarding university education.
Remote work began with the monks in China.
Road closures were imposed in Hubei.
The buses were rerouted, and the museums in China were shut down.
Mobility controls were implemented in several cities, and an estimated 760 million people (more than half the population) were placed under lockdown.After the outbreak in March, the Chinese government imposed strict restrictions to prevent the virus from spreading to other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day quarantine for all foreigners.As of 23 March, China had only one case of the disease in the country in five days, from a person returning from Guangzhou to Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese premier Li Keqiang said that the spread of the disease among those inside the country had been contained and that China had closely monitored the threat.
On the same day that the roads in Hubei were closed, they left Wuhan, two months after the quarantine.The Chinese Foreign Ministry in Hubei said on 26 March 2020 that they could not issue visas for entry in the country on any day from 28 March and that they did not specify when the ban would end.
Those wishing to enter China will need to apply for a visa at the Chinese Embassy or Consulate.
The Chinese government issued a warning to the companies on March 30, and gave a small amount of money to the company's shareholders.The city authorities requested a day of mourning at 10:00 on April 4, observing the Qingming festival, but the central government urged people to remember online to observe social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
COVID-19 first emerged in South Korea on 20 September 2020 before it emerged in China.
The health centre reported that the number of patients was increasing on April 20, due to a meeting held by the Daegu Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji people who traveled to Daegu from Wuhan were found to be responsible for the outbreak.
As of 22 February, 9,336 people in Eklesia, 1,261 or 13% had symptoms.South Korea had the highest number of cases on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 people were infected in Korah, rising to 3,150 on 29 February.
All communities of South Korean people with lymphoma were placed under quarantine after three people tested positive for the virus.
Airports were also affected.South Korea initiated the world's first and largest population-based virus testing campaign, and quarantined those infected and those in close contact with them.
The testing service allowed people to come in first if they had symptoms so that foreign travellers could report through a mobile application, public transportation and virus testing and increased the testing capacity to 20,000 people tested per day.
It was found that the South Korean government was able to effectively monitor the spread of the virus even without the imposition of quarantine. South Korean society was appalled by President Jae-in's comments on the incident.
Several Koreans have called for his resignation because of what they called ill-management, or dissatisfaction with what he said.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had been on the brink of a nuclear arms race for four weeks because of a single man.

In Ukraine, buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners from Wuhan, were attacked as they were being transported to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from the northeastern part of India, which borders China, and who study in India's major cities have reported that they too have been affected by the coronavirus outbreak.
Bharatiya Janata Party state president in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh said the Chinese have destroyed the country and are being punished by God.
The Chinese Consulate in Kolkata, however, denied the allegations and said it was "wrong". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese people has become more prevalent due to the epidemic, and foreigners are called "foreigners' trash" and are considered to be "disposable".
Most of the journals on the paywalls have removed some or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific journals have published papers on the subject that are freely available to the public.
Some scientists have chosen to quickly post their results to sites such as bioRxiv.

Tests for the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) respiratory illness and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses are focused on the detection of the virus and the detection of antibody responses.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is aimed at detecting the SARS-COV-2 viral RNA.
It is used to detect new or existing diseases in the body.
Antibody testing (serology) can be performed for diagnosis and monitoring purposes.
Antibody testing reveals the number of people who are infected, including those whose symptoms are too mild to be detected or who are asymptomatic.
The exact mortality rate and the overall immunity level of the population can be determined from the results of these tests.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020 no country had reliable data on how the virus is spreading among its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested 3% of its population, and there are significant differences in the way countries have tested.
This difference may also have a significant impact on mortality, which in many countries is likely to be very low.
Using the post-transcriptional reverse polymerase (rRT-PCR) assay can be done on breath samples obtained from a number of sources, including partial nasal swabs or a cough sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
A RT-PCR test based on a test of the saliva only produces a positive result if the disease is present in the primary host.
The virus may then disappear from the throat but continue to reproduce in the lungs.
For patients who have a secondary urine test, this may be done by draining the inner airway through a catheter or a urine sample.
The first PCR test was launched at Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using the results of the polymerase reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) technique, and resulted in the production of 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also launched a test kit on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebioch developed a test kit, the PC-based SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirisi) on 28 January 2020.
Identify all E genes that contain all beta coronaviruses and specific RdRp genes of SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI was the first company to receive approval from the Chinese Pharmaceutical Industry Regulatory Authority to develop a PCR kit for the SARS-COV-2 test.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing the kit to test for the novel coronavirus-2019 (2019-nCoV) in real-time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to all laboratories using Reagent International Resource.
In our three genetic tests on the older models, the test kits were not producing good results, and the difficulty of testing at the CDC in Atlanta; resulting in a testing of 100 samples per day by February 2020.
The use of two-time-release assays was deemed ineffective on 28 February 2020, after which state and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approves tests under emergency authorization.U.S. laboratories began supporting the tests in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020 LabCorp announced that the public could now test for COVID-19 using RT-PCR.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics has agreed to begin testing COVID-19 in the general population on March 9, 2020.
No final numbers were provided; sampling and testing should be done according to CDC guidelines.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test kits were developed at the VECTOR Virology and Biotechnology Research Center.
On 11 February 2020, the Ministry of Health approved the use of the test. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a COVID-19 test machine. On 13 March 2020, the FDA approved Roch Diagnostics to perform tests that would have taken 3.5 hours to complete at maximum capacity, allowing one machine to perform approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA approved Abbott Laboratories to test the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA has previously approved the use of Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received EUA approval from the FDA for a 45-minute test.
The FDA approved a test that requires the use of isothermic nucleic acid instead of PCR.
The procedure does not require temperature adjustment, and the method can provide a positive result in less than five minutes and a negative result in less than 13 minutes.
There are currently 18,000 pen machines in the United States and Abbott researchers will perform 50,000 tests per day.The test, which uses a specific antibody to the nucleocapsid protein (protein N) of the new coronavirus, is being tested in Taiwan, with the hope that it can produce results in 15 to 20 minutes as is the case with the influenza test.
In March 2020 the journal reported that a chest radiograph is not essential in the early stages, but CT [computed tomography] can be done even before symptoms appear.
CT scans include simple multilateral scans with peripheral, asymmetric and external scans.
The sub-pleural is large, powerful and strong when disease is spreading.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the beginning of the outbreak states that CT is much more robust than PCR, but has limited validity, and some of its scans are superior to pneumonia and other infections.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology advised that CT should not be used for the detection of COVID-19 or as a primary test. In March 2020, the CDC advised that people use PCR in the early stages.
To fight infection we can generate antibodies including IgG and IgG.
It can be used to diagnose human infection from 7 days or more after the onset of symptoms, to assess immunity, and to monitor individuals. Testing can be done in a central laboratory (CLT) or in a point of care (PocT) setting.
The most complex automated systems in many hospital laboratories will be able to perform these tests but their capabilities are limited by the number of people each system can handle.
For CLT a small sample of blood is usually used, although several samples may be used to assess immunity.
For PoCT a blood sample was usually drawn from the skin of the tongue.
Unlike PCR, phase-locking methods are not required before starting.On 26 March 2020, the FDA identified 29 sites that are subject to mandatory reporting and can now distribute their antibody tests.
On April 7, 2020, the FDA approved only one emergency test.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval to begin operating their own test machines, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in viral blood samples.
They are capable of running multiple tests on samples at the same time and will be faster than conventional PCR for viral RNA testing.
Antibodies are usually detected within 14 days of the onset of the disease.In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the test kits purchased were effective.
Hong Kong introduced a home-contact procedure, where the emergency department would give patients a tube, spray it, return it, and send it for testing. The British NHS announced a home-contact procedure for testing suspected cases, which would prevent a patient from transmitting the virus to others when they visit the hospital or use an ambulance to test a person. In testing for COVID-19 in suspected cases, a doctor would take a sample with extreme caution.
Mobile testing centers have helped South Korea to provide rapid and comprehensive testing worldwide.In Germany, the National Association for Medical Health Insurance said on 2 March, that it has the capacity to perform nearly 12,000 tests per day in ambulances and performed 10,700 tests in ambulances last week.
The cost is covered by health insurance if the examination is required by the doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to perform 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, the examinations allowed most major cities to hold the examinations.
As of 26 March 2020, the number of cases tested in Germany is unknown, as only cases are reported.
The first laboratory survey conducted in the week of 12/2020 showed that approximately 483,295 samples were tested and based on the week of 12/2020 and 33 491 samples (6.9%) were positive for SARS-COV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam hospitals developed a new method and tested samples from 64 people at a time, placing samples and only testing samples for multiple infections.In Wuham a 2000-sq-metre high-risk laboratory named Huo- (YanKishinwa: 火眼, or Human Eye in Lingala) was launched on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which can test 10,000 samples per day.
In a study led by BGI founder Wang Jian that took 5 days, Hubei's manufacturing costs would have been 47% higher and the cost of quarantine would have doubled had they not started the testing process.
Huo-Yan in Shenzehen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, followed quickly by the Wuhan laboratory, with a total of 12 Chinese cities following them.
As of 4 March 2020 the number of tests performed per day reached 50,000.One of the models, a multiplex device developed by Origami Assays, can test COVID19 samples from 1,122 patients using only 93 assays.The best models can be used in small laboratories without the assistance of robots.
In March, the shortage of test kits became a major concern in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This has led some authors to develop a method to use samples that require a human subject to be heated to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to extract RNA genomes for further testing.On 31 March, it was reported that the United Arab Emirates is testing more people for coronavirus per day than any other country, and has already tested the vast majority of its population.
It was developed through a series of initiatives, including the acquisition of a large number of laboratory test kits by Group 42 and BGI (under their Huo-Yan brand of Chinese Emergency Diagnostic Laboratories).
The laboratory, which was built in 14 days, can perform several hundred RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this size to be used outside of China.
Several test methods have been developed for various strains of coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has endorsed a German-designed test-tube for use in developing countries that do not have the capacity to do so themselves.
The German version was released on 17 January 2020; the version that was released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January; it resulted in the US testing being unavailable.China and the United States were initially concerned about the lack of quality testing equipment, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide a sufficient number of machines to meet the medical demand.
In contrast, the medical community has argued that the South Korean testing facility has significantly reduced the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Testing facilities, mostly in private laboratories, were developed over several decades by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization stated that screening programs are the most effective way to slow the spread of COVID-19.The high demand for screening in the context of the pandemic has left many US laboratories with limited capacity and limited access to fluids and diagnostic equipment.
In March 2020 China reported a failure of its testing equipment.
In the United States, the CDC's test kits were "defective", prompting the government to lift restrictions on private laboratories from testing.Spain purchased test kits from a Chinese company, Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results to be inaccurate.
The company said that the negative results could be due to incorrect sampling or incorrect machine operation.
The Spanish Ministry of Health said it would remove the machines that produced negative results, and replace them with machines from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test machines purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave negative results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test machines from China but they were negative.
Prime Minister Matovič said they were being dumped into the Danube.Ates Kara, Turkey's health minister, said the machines Turkey bought from China were "very bad" and "not usable".The UK bought 3.5 million test machines from China but in early April 2020 said they were "not usable".
Testing, followed by quarantine of infected individuals and follow-up of contacts of people with SARS-COV-2, has been successful.
Researchers in the Italian city of Vò, where the first COVID-19 case in Italy was reported, tested nearly 3,400 people twice, over a period of about ten days.
About half of the cases were asymptomatic, and all those who were found to be infected were quarantined.
A travel ban was imposed in the area, preventing any further transmission of the disease.
With strict contact tracing, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus in Singapore has spread more effectively than in other developing countries, but without strict restrictions such as restaurant and retail closures.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began to announce a stay-at-home order on 28 March, but schools were reopened during the holiday on 23 March.
Many other countries have also taken strict measures to control the disease, monitoring contacts, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but others have been more lenient, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Data-driven studies have found that countries with high testing rates, in terms of mortality, had fewer deaths, and those countries were likely to be able to identify people with few or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with sufficient testing capacity and official laboratories with limited COVID-19 capacity send initial positive and ten initial negative COVID-19 test results to one of 16 WHO-approved laboratories for review.
Of the 16 accredited laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the list of % of cases is based on the national testing systems available.
Countries that test only inpatients will have a higher percentage of cases than countries that test the general population, whether they have symptoms or not.
Hand washing, also called hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning hands to remove dirt, oil, germs, and other contaminants.
Washing hands with soap often at certain times of the day prevents the spread of common diseases, such as diarrhoea, which is passed through the feces and is passed through the mouth.
People can also develop respiratory illnesses such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (such as the urinary tract).
The five key times of the day when hand washing with soap is important are: before and after shopping, after cleaning baby's diapers or cleaning the crib, before feeding the baby, before eating and after cooking food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, you can wash your hands with a hand sanitizer.The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After removing and dressing the baby kush or washing the baby from the toilet.
After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After contact with animals, animal food, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the hygiene practices during medical practice.
Handwashing before administering medication or treating a patient can help prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
The main reason for hand washing is to remove harmful substances (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and other substances that can cause harm or disease.
It is important for those who handle food or practice medicine, but it is also important for everyone.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other diseases; preventing diarrheal diseases; and reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the mortality rate of newborns born at home.
A 2013 study found that handwashing can affect the development of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, the number of children dying from respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced only by making changes in habits, such as washing hands with soap.
This small step could reduce the mortality rate of this disease by about 50%.
Activities that promote hand washing can increase the risk of diarrhoea threefold, and are just as important in providing clean water in developing countries.
48% reduction in diarrheal illness can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the simplest and least expensive way to prevent diseases such as diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), and is a key practice that should be followed in homes, schools, and communities worldwide.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (ARI) is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, killing nearly 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, promoting handwashing with soap before and after meals and after urination could save more lives than any vaccine or drug, and reduce the number of deaths from diarrhoea by half and deaths from severe respiratory illness by a quarter.
Hand washing is often combined with other water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also helps prevent the infection that is transmitted by touch.
The only drawback of handwashing is that frequent handwashing can damage the skin and can dry it out.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to dry, scaly hands, eczema or dermatitis, which is a common medical condition.
Excessive hand washing is also one of the symptoms of a condition called obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five main periods when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the rate of oral-to-nasal transmission: after going to the toilet (bathing, shopping), after washing a child's face (cleaning and dressing), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after cooking food or handling raw meat, or poultry.
Other occasions when proper hand washing is a must to prevent the spread of disease include washing hands before and after treating wounds; after coughing, sneezing, and touching the nose; after touching animal or animal feces; and after touching human waste.
In many countries, handwashing with soap is not common.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap.In 2014 a study showed Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97 percent; the United States was near the middle at 77 percent; and China at the lowest at 23 percent.There are many initiatives today that have changed the practices of handwashing with water and soap at special occasions.Collective handwashing for schoolchildren at designated times is one of the initiatives in developing countries to incorporate this into children's behavior.
The Health Priority Program, which was piloted by the Philippine Ministry of Education, is an example of a program to promote children's health and education.
Two-yearly flushing, along with daily hand washing with soap, daily brushing with toothpaste, are important parts of the community program.
Women use it in Indonesia and produce beautiful fruit.
Removal of bacteria from the skin is best done by adding soap or water to the disinfectant.
The main function of soap and detergents is to facilitate treatment, and to increase its effectiveness.
Water can also be a good cleanser for the skin because the oil and proteins, which are naturally present in soil, cannot be broken down by water.
However, cleansing is more effective when it is done with sufficient water.
Because soap is reusable, it may be contaminated by contaminants from previous users.
A few studies of the transmission of germs by strong soaps have concluded that they are not infectious because they are washed with a detergent.
However, the CDC says that a water-based soap with no contact area is more effective in preventing the spread of disease.
Many recommend the use of disinfectant soaps for health care.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of antiseptic or disinfectant is being promoted to eliminate the world's most virulent pathogens.
However, disinfectant soaps often contain a disinfectant such as triclosan, which contains many of the most commonly used microbes.
Thus, even if antibiotics that are not picked from soap contain an antibacterial agent, they may not be as effective as those that are cooked.
In addition to topical and skin-protective agents, complex agents may include acids (acetic acid, ascarbic acid, lactic acid) and pH adjustments, benzoic acid to treat bacteria, and other skin-dyeing agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, herbal products).Researchers at the University of Oregon School of Public Health have found that our natural soaps are as effective as the soap containing the disinfectant triclosan in fighting infection and removing germs from the hands.
Handwashing water that is not sterilized is not germ-killing.
Bacteria grow more quickly in a body that has a temperature of 37 °C.
However, hot, soapy water is more effective at removing oil and dirt and bacteria than cold water.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific research shows that using a hand sanitizer does not eliminate germs.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a water-based hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, waterless hand sanitizer (also called alcohol-based hand sanitizer, hand antiseptic, or hand sanitizer) became widely available.
It is usually made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with a carbolic acid gel, or a humectant such as glycerin in water, or a foam to make it more usable and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide to the liquid increases the activity of the antibiotic. An antibiotic with an alcohol content of 60 to 95% is effective in killing the bacteria.
Alcohol-based antibiotics are effective against bacteria, resistant to fruit antiseptics (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and other viruses (including AIDS, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, measles, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
A 70% alcohol hand sanitizer kills 99.97% (lowering log by 3.5, and raising decibel by 35) of germs on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (lowering log by 4 to 5) of germs on hands 1 minute after application. Hand sanitizer is more effective at killing germs but not as effective at killing other viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are generally not effective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, which are often transmitted by the gut.An antiseptic or alcohol-based hand sanitizer should be prepared in sufficient quantities to be thoroughly washed with or over both hands.
Wash the front and back of both hands and the middle of the hands and fingernails for 30 seconds until the water, foam or gel dries.
It requires washing and nail polish, covering both hands. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing as a substitute for hand sanitizer, especially if the hands are very dirty.
Water-based hand sanitizers are widely used because they are easy to use and quick to disinfect; however, they cannot be used as a substitute for a good hand wash, unless soap and water are available.
Regular use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can dry the skin unless hand sanitizers are added.
Alcohol-based hand dryer can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other hand dryer ingredients.
During human vaccine trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with hand sanitizers, produced less skin irritation and less dryness of the hands than soap or disinfectants.
The skin usually did not become red, bruised, or irritated by the alcohol or other drugs.
The use of anti-inflammatory products instead of soap and water to wash hands has become increasingly popular.
Even though they are strong, water-based hand sanitizers do not remove organic matter from the hands, but only clean them.
Therefore, hand sanitizers are less effective than soap and water in preventing the spread of most germs, as the germs remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of nonalcoholic hand sanitizers depends largely on the ingredients and the method of preparation, and it appears that the most effective are those containing alcohol and those containing seventy-one percent alcohol.
In the past, benzalkonium chloride-based antibiotics have been effective in killing bacteria after application, unlike alcohol, which has been found to lose its effectiveness with prolonged use, possibly because of its high concentration of skin acids.
In poor areas, people can buy soap and use dust or earth instead.
Dust or soil may be more dense than water itself, but not as dense as soap.
One concern is that contaminated soil can increase the spread of disease rather than prevent it.
Like soap, dust is also a lubricant because it combines with water to form an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends using dust or sand instead of soap if soap is not available.
The best hand-washing practices recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the spread of disease are as follows:
Wash your hands with warm or cold running water.
They said the use of running water was because players sitting in the same area may be infected, and the water temperature is irrelevant.
Wash your hands by rubbing them with soap and water, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap kills bacteria on the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly and for longer if soap is used instead of water.
Apply the soap for 20 seconds.
This helps to remove bacteria from the skin, and prolonged brushing kills most bacteria.
Wash your hands thoroughly with running water.
Hands can be re-infected by wiping with a towel.
Wash with a clean cloth or let air dry.
Wet hands are susceptible to infection. The areas that are most commonly affected are the thumb, wrist, the middle fingers, and the base of the fingernails.
Toenail polishes and nail polishes may be contaminated.
It is often recommended to use ointments to treat dry hands; dry hands can damage the skin and can make a person more susceptible to disease.
Many inexpensive hand sanitizers can be used to help with hand washing where water and/or soap are unavailable such as pouring water from a dish or cup with a top and proper holes and/or using a dustpan if necessary in developing countries. If water is scarce (for example in schools in rural areas in developing countries), they do not have water conservation systems, such as tippy-taps and other less expensive methods.
Tippy-tap is a simple method of using a top-mounted, string-tipped, and string-operated tap to spray some water and soap on the hands.
Proper hand washing is essential for good health, but there is considerable debate about the proper way to wash hands in public restrooms.
Research is increasingly supporting the idea that hand washing is much more effective than the multi-valve hand dryer.
In 2008, a small study was conducted at the University of Westminster, London, and funded by the European Tissue Symposium, a hand dryer manufacturer, to understand the differences between hand dryers, hand dryers and new hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hand dryer, the number of germs in the fingers increased by 194% and in the hands by 254%.
After washing and drying hands with a hand dryer, the number of germs increased on the fingers by 42% and on the hands by 15%.
After washing and wiping hands with a hand dryer, the number of microbes decreased, from 76% on the fingers to 77% on the hands.The scientists also conducted tests to determine if people who used the washbasin and the washbasin had spread microbes after several rounds of hand drying.
A hand dryer, which emits air at a speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), could spray microorganisms from the hands to the toilet and touch other people in the toilet up to a distance of 2 meters.
Using a hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 metres away from the machine.
Hand dryers have shown at least one of the microorganisms to be spreading.In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt examined several hand drying methods.
The following differences in bacterial counts were found after hand-drying:
There are many companies that manufacture hand dryers, and there are different hand dryers and cloth dryers.
Hand washing with a hand dryer is another way to dry hands during travel if soap and water are not available.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers should contain 60% alcohol.
The use of hand sanitizers became widespread long after the Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered their efficacy (in 1846) in preventing the spread of disease in hospital settings.
Many devices are designed to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget to do so.
One study found that the rate of disease transmission was reduced by their use.
Hand washing agents are for 15 seconds, applying water and a lot of soap or ointment to all areas of the hands.
It is necessary to wash hands together by joining them together in a circle of friends.
If there is dirt under the nails, a small piece of cloth may be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in water on the hands, it is important to remove the water and wipe it with a clean cloth.
After drying, a drying cloth should be used to trap the water (and to flush the exit door if available).
This helps to prevent the hands from infecting these areas.
The purpose of hand hygiene is to remove contamination (microbes) and prevent transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that in hospitals, too many people do not wash their hands, and many doctors and nurses often forget to wash their hands before touching patients, thus infecting them.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple hygiene measures can reduce the risk of blood-borne diseases by 66%.The World Health Organization has published a handbook on hand washing and dusting for healthcare professionals.
The organization's handwashing guidelines are available and can also be found on its website for public comment.
Whitby and his colleagues made a significant assessment.
The vending machines can test and tell if the hands are clean, if the required cleaning method is sufficient.
The World Health Organization has identified five steps to wash your hands:
after contact with blood/ bodily fluids
before you perform this hand sanitizer, and
After treating a patient. Adding an antiseptic to a hand sanitizer (a soap or detergent containing a disinfectant) helps the hand sanitizer to disinfect.
Disinfection may be necessary before surgery or in areas where bacteria are particularly common.  Wash hands for surgery, if necessary have a water pump that can be opened or closed, do not touch hands, use a small amount of chlorhexidine or iodine solution, a disinfected cloth to dry hands after washing, and a disinfected washcloth to remove dirt and other disinfected material to remove nail stains.
All jewelry must be removed.
The hand and forearm should be washed to the middle of the arm, usually for 2-6 minutes.
Delaying the grinding (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When rinsing, you should prevent water from flowing from the front of your hands to the back of your hands.
After washing hands, they should be wiped with a sterile cloth and a medical glove should be worn.
To prevent the spread of germs, it is advisable to wash or use hand antiseptic before and after treating a patient.
Based on clinical studies of staphylococcal disease, it was found that the greatest benefit from handwashing occurred after the first 20% of handwashing, and that the least benefit was achieved after handwashing at 35%.
Handwashing with soap increases the rate of infection of food by three times compared to handwashing with antifungal soap. In contrast to handwashing with an alcohol-based handwash, handwashing with a hand sanitizer for 30 seconds reduces the rate of infection by 26% compared to handwashing with antifungal soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers at controlling the H1N1 influenza A virus and clostridium difficile spores on the hands. Efforts to improve hand hygiene in hospitals may require teaching hand hygiene to staff, making more alcohol-based hand sanitizers available, and oral and written instructions to staff.
There is a lot of research to determine which of these strategies will work in many areas of health.
It has been found that in developing countries, handwashing with soap is affordable, essential to good health, and even essential to a healthy diet.
However, the lack of water, soap, and handwashing facilities in the home, in schools, and in the workplace makes it difficult for everyone to get used to handwashing.
For example, in many African countries, hand washing facilities near private or public toilets are scarce, although cheap options are available for hand washing facilities.
However, not washing hands often may be a habit and not due to a lack of soap and water.
Promoting and encouraging handwashing with soap can drive policy decisions, promote important handwashing messages and help people make real behavioral changes.
For a successful project, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A review of 70 studies found that promoting community handwashing is important in LMICs, but resistance to stigma is less effective.One example of promoting handwashing in schools is UNICEF's "Three Steps" which encourages schools to develop simple, low-cost practices that can make students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene measures.
If schools succeed in instilling some moral values, they can now move on to the more rigorous ones.
The establishment of hand washing facilities may be part of the public awareness campaigns on hand washing that are being carried out to reduce childhood illness and death.
The Global Handwashing Day is another example of a public health campaign that is helping people change behaviour.In the wake of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF is promoting the release of a handwashing emoji.
Other studies have looked at the overall cost of handwashing in developing countries in terms of DALYs.
However, a study shows that promoting handwashing with soap is less expensive than other methods such as water and other cleaning methods.
The importance of handwashing for health, especially for vulnerable populations such as new mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand-washing: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, an Englishwoman, who pioneered the practice of nursing".
At that time, the only commonly accepted cause of illness was a foul odor called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of foodborne illness and health-related diseases prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to further promote hand hygiene and to emphasize the importance of preventing the spread of disease.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised global awareness of the importance of handwashing with soap to prevent similar infectious diseases.
For example, posters with the words "safe hand washing practices" have been placed near public hand washing stations and office and airport hand washing stations in Germany.
The expression "to wash [one's] hands of what is unclean" implies that one should refuse to take responsibility for something or to share in it.
It appeared in the biblical passage where Matthew records that Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a common phrase in English-speaking countries.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mother Macbeth begins the ritual washing of her hands to cleanse the mental impurity that is her own conscience of the crimes she has committed and encouraged her husband to commit.
It seems that after reminding people of bad habits or if they themselves think about them, they wash their hands more often than others, and they are more appreciative of hand sanitizers.
Furthermore, people who are allowed to wash their hands after these practices are often not allowed to participate in other more intensive hygienic practices, such as volunteering.
Hand washing is a religious practice that is both symbolic and purely physical. Symbolic hand washing, which is the use of water rather than soap to wash hands, is a practice of hand washing in many religions, including the Bahá'í, Hindu, the Tevilah and the Netilat yadayim in Judaism, the Lavabo in Christianity and the Wudhu in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam all require that people wash their hands after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam also require hand washing before and after eating.
Safety equipment at work COVID-19
COVID-19 workplace protective equipment is used to implement safety and health measures to prevent the spread of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The appropriate prevention measures at work depend on the workplace and the work, including the risk of exposure to hazardous situations, the extent of exposure to the community, and the risk of workers being exposed to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), a low-risk job is one that requires minimal contact with other people and coworkers, requires the use of basic safety precautions, such as hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, developing respiratory illness, and maintaining a healthy and hygienic workplace.
Medium-risk occupations are occupations that require frequent contact with or in close proximity to people who are known or likely to have COVID-19, but may be ill due to contact with many people or travel to many countries.
This is especially true of employees who are exposed to a lot of people - in schools, in busy workplaces, and in other crowded places.
Precautions in this group, in addition to the usual precautions for infection, include the use of ventilators with high-pressure filters, precautions for coughing, and personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person with COVID-19 infection.
OSHA considers physicians and morgue staff to be known or likely contacts of COVID-19 patients at high risk, and requires that those who perform aerosol work or handle or collect samples, of people who have or may have COVID-19.
The safety precautions for people who do these jobs may include avoiding poor ventilation in buildings, and wearing appropriate protective clothing for this work.
An outbreak of COVID-19 can have significant risks in the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work because of illness, the need to protect others, or the risk of exposure to the disease.
Business patterns may change, as may consumer demand, and the way in which these goods are obtained (e.g., shopping at busy times or through home delivery services).
Finally, they can prevent delivery to areas where COVID-19 infection is common. Preparing for disease can help determine what to do to protect themselves.
The plans cover the risk levels in the workplace and workplaces, including the people you will be working with, the risks that will be associated with accidents in the home and other settings, and the risks that workers such as the elderly or people with chronic health conditions may be exposed to.
It also discusses how to monitor for these risks, and how to manage the potential health effects of the disease.
Prevention and control measures for infectious diseases will be determined by national or local legislation.
The best approach to preventing infections involves reducing the risk of infection among employees, protecting those at high risk from a long-standing illness, maintaining a healthy workforce, and making sure that it does not interfere with the work of other companies that work with you.
The course of action will depend on how the disease affects your brain.
Personal risk management is a recognized process to protect the safety of employees and the health of the public in the most effective manner.
Where the risk of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the best way to deal with it is to focus on the machines, following the authorities' assessment, and finally providing the appropriate personal protective equipment.
Machine supervision is about keeping workers away from the hazards of work without compromising work ethics, and it can be a good way to do things.
Management review is a change in the way work is done that requires the employer or employee to change their way of working.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less effective than mechanical or official inspections, but it can help to avoid certain risks.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the risks to the worker, whether they are suitable (e.g. respirators), properly and consistently worn, maintained, and replaced, if necessary, and properly disposed of, washed, maintained or disposed of for disease prevention.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the least hazardous occupations are those that require fewer contacts and fewer coworkers.
The best prevention practices for the spread of disease in the approved workplace include regular hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if sick, if they have respiratory illness, covering the mouth or nose if they cough or sneeze, having dry clothes and a disposable area, maintaining telecommunication equipment or other equipment if necessary to prevent employees from using other people's equipment, and maintaining workplace hygiene and cleanliness.
Early identification and isolation of potential patients is the most effective way to protect employees, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of respiratory infections remain at home until the fever, symptoms of fever, and other symptoms resolve in at least 24 hours without the use of antipyretics or other medication for other symptoms, and that they establish effective policies for adequate leave, allowing employees to stay home to care for sick family members, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, the average risk at work is related to conditions such as people who are in close contact or within 1.8 meters of people with or thought to be infected with COVID-19, but may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 due to the high prevalence of the disease in the workplace, or due to recent travel to other countries where COVID-19 is common.
It is important for workers who encounter a variety of people including in schools, crowded workplaces, and other crowded places. Maintaining machinery for such people requires the installation of high pressure air filters, making ventilators more efficient, installing air-tight separators such as air-tight vent valves, and windows for customer reception. Official safety teams for many organizations will need to encourage sick workers to stay home, prevent online meetings from being a danger to themselves, provide warnings to avoid unnecessary travel to COVID-19-prevented areas, create a uniform and other forums for communication about workplace hazards, provide training for COVID-19 safety and health personnel and provide training on workplace safety, such as the use of hand-blown, hand-washing, and manual handling equipment, and inform employees of COVID-19 safety precautions, such as the use of hand sanitizers, hand sanitizers, and hand sanitizers.
Workers in this group are less likely to use a respiratory device.
If a patient is on a flight, the most effective way to protect the flight crew and passengers is to keep the patient at least 6 feet away from other passengers, designate a crew member to care for the patient, and provide a face mask or ask the patient to cover his or her mouth and nose with a cloth when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew should wear a mask when assisting a sick passenger or handling bodily fluids or other potentially infectious materials, and take extra precautions if the patient develops fever, persistent cough, or respiratory distress.
Bags and other disposable items should be disposed of in a safe place, and contaminated areas should be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial ships, including cruise ships and other passengers, safety includes avoiding travel if you are sick, and taking precautions and informing the medical staff immediately if any passenger has a fever or other symptoms.
It is important to monitor the health of the individual in the facility.For schools or child care facilities, CDC will recommend that the facility be temporarily closed for cleaning or disinfection if a patient has been on the school grounds regardless of whether the disease is widespread in the community.
If the disease is not spreading widely in the community, precautions may be taken to prevent contact with others, such as cancelling trips, conventions, and other large gatherings such as physical education or choir meetings at schools or dining out, including the separation of offices, waiting for arrival and departure times, avoiding unnecessary visits, and using separate medical offices for children with flu symptoms.
If the disease is widespread in your community, in addition to warning residents, you may be able to close schools for extended periods of time.For officers who will be performing their normal duties, the CDC says their risk level is low.
Police officers who have to deal with people who may have or have had COVID-19 should follow the same protocols as those used by healthcare professionals, including wearing appropriate personal protective equipment.
If you come in contact with a person during a surgical operation, these people should clean and disinfect their work straps and equipment prior to use, using a vacuum cleaner and following the safety and disposal guidelines provided by PPE and the safety and washing guidelines.
OSHA considers some healthcare professionals and morgue workers to be at high risk or in high risk groups.
High-risk occupations include delivery, care, laboratory, and personnel who transport patients who may have or have had COVID-19.
They are at increased risk if they perform aerosol work, or collect or use samples from people who have or may have had COVID-19.
Aerosol treatments include intubation, treatment of cough, bronchoscopy, or other dental procedures or examinations, or the acquisition of exocrine.
The most common risk for morgue workers is that they are working on the autopsy of people who died from COVID-19 at the time of death or suspected death; they are at high risk if they are later tested for the disease from which they died. Another risk for them is when they are treating people who have or are suspected to have COVID-19 in their rooms, including when performing aerosol work.
A ventilator may be appropriate in some hospitals and morgues.
Samples should be used according to biosafety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating patients into separate waiting rooms depending on whether they are confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. In addition to the recommendation to wear PPE, OSHA recommends people who work within 6 feet of people who are known to have, or have been infected with, SARS-CoV-2, and perform other aerosol work.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 respirators or higher should be widely used in respiratory prevention including fit testing, training, and clinical evaluations.
Some types of respirators are more protective and work-safe than others. WHO does not recommend full-face masks, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not spread through bodily fluids.
WHO will only recommend the use of medical masks for testing purposes.
For people who are collecting respiratory samples from patients, caring for, or transporting COVID-19 patients without performing aerosol operations, WHO recommends the use of medical masks, goggles, or face shields, blouses, and bags.
If you are using aerosol sprays, instead of a medical mask, use an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Because the supply of PPE is limited, WHO will recommend the use of less PPE in telemedicine, social distancing measures such as open windows, allowing access to the patient's room for COVID-19 patients, use only PPE that is necessary for a specific task, continue to use the same respirator without removing it when treating multiple patients with the same illness, maintain and use other PPE properly, and discourage the use of masks for people without symptoms.

CC0: No rights at all
This month we are experiencing truly amazing events.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that we are connected to each other and have responsibilities to each other.
We do not know what the consequences will be, but we do know that our effective efforts to combat it are supported by the strength, cooperation, and community that are vital to this organization.
The friendliness and love we have seen among all our colleagues in e-mails, phone calls, and conversations really makes us feel that we are working with the best of people.
I am very grateful to all of you and very happy to have you as my friends.
Last week, someone told me how much they appreciated our work.
It reminded me how important it is for people to go to Wikipedia right now, and it's a strong indication that important work should be online and accessible to everyone.
Your work helps make it happen, whether it's putting updates on our sites or paying our friends or protecting our community.
Right now, the world needs the information that Wikipedia provides.
This is the time when things will matter to the world not only what we do but how we do it.
Because this work and your role are so important, we will change the way we work together, starting this week.
Changes in Service and Schedule
As Robyn has just mentioned, group c met last night to discuss our work schedule and our schedule for the coming days and months.
In these discussions, we discuss what we think is the best way to deal with the challenges we will face and the best way to ensure our organization continues to function in this era.
We want to relieve stress and support our ministry for as long as possible.
If you want to call us, that's fine.
For managers, entrepreneurs and all employees:
Our daily work hours will be 4 hours, or 20 hours a week until we change it.
We are not saying that you are on leave - if you are able to work overtime, you may be hired.
But the world is uncertain, and if you have to care for a loved one, go shopping for food, or go to the doctor, his health should come first.
We do not keep track of your work hours.
If you get sick, don't come to work.
It should be done without saying it, but we will say it.
Don't be a sick day or PTO - just tell your boss and help your co-workers figure out how to schedule so that important tasks can be kept on track.
(If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, please contact Bryan within T&amp;C Ops to have T&amp;C support and help you get the attention of the authorities).
They will charge for every hour of work.
We have said this, and we reiterate our commitment to honor our agreements with our contractors and co-workers on the hours.
All employees will be paid based on the hours they regularly work when things are done as a routine.
It also depends on whether you are sick or unable to work.
If you want to do it, we'll help you.
Many people use work as a means of sharing their anxieties with those around them.
What we do can be very helpful, especially in times like these.
It also depends on how you protect yourself.
We would ask that you speak with your supervisor, so that we can work out what we are doing and make the necessary changes.
Some activities are considered to be of special importance.
There are other areas in which we need to keep moving forward.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp; Safety, and Fundraising teams (including) perform essential functions that may require additional support.
We will begin work with all departments to identify our new goals and focus now on supporting the key aspects of our work.
We all have a lot to do, but we will focus on the more important tasks.
Failure now will not hurt us later.
We have no intention of working twice as hard to recover once the disease is gone.
We will not require you to work overtime to complete tasks on dates that are not currently valid.
We will accept the change, and we will adjust to set new goals and deadlines where necessary.
What will happen to the APP (annual planning)?
In order to adapt to the new circumstances and daily working hours, we would like to change the timing of the publication of our 2020-2021 annual planning.
We propose to add more days to our 2019-2020 planning to allow us to make budgetary adjustments that will allow our employees to focus on more important tasks, safety, and time-sensitive care, and to consider who needs or wants to work the same hours in the coming weeks.
The extension would significantly increase the workload of the current administration and the pressure on the entire organization.
We will send our proposal to the authorities next week and inform our representatives and teams what to do next once we get the official response.
We thank the APP team for managing these projects.
Office status, health risk, and cleanliness
Last week, we were informed that one of our friends may have been in contact with someone who has the COVID-19 virus.
But to be on the safe side, we disinfected every part of Francisco's office with antifungal agents.
They used a disinfectant used in hospitals to clean all the rooms, the lobby and the elevators that lead to our office.
The house is used according to its own rules.
We feel reassured that the office will be fine when we return.
Our DC office is hosted by WeWork, who have informed us of their COVID-19 security policies and have made them available to all DC employees.
Last week, our DC office was reorganized to work remotely in response to guidance from San Francisco.
As some of our friends in New York City know, we also had discussions about finding a place in Brooklyn.
This series is still on hold.
Some of our friends will be serving at a distance for the first time.
Our long-time remote workers know that it can be a change, and we would like to offer you some advice:
Keep the meeting to an hour or two.
If more time is needed, see if you can do it in stages over several days.
Be clear about the purpose of the meeting, what will be discussed, and send in advance the details.
Indicate the video to be used, using tools such as Google Doc and Zoom to make live discussions more effective and better connections.
Have a moderator to ensure that each meeting runs smoothly, someone to answer chat questions and speakers list items, and someone to help take notes (or help each other take notes).
Email IT support if you need a good headset.
Spend your money well on food.
Join the #remoties chain on Slack to chat with your friends about work
The HR team is looking forward to online meetings for guidance to help manage the various projects for the Foundation.
Last week, we announced the suspension of all public events sponsored by Wikipedia, such as editathons, until the WHO declared the pandemic over.
We will inform them that we understand that the request to cancel these appointments and other restrictions may make it difficult to meet our commitments and that we will not be responsible for any delay or change in these commitments.
Next week, we will be introducing more rules at Wikimania and other community meetings and events.
The feelings of our global community are saddened by the suspension of these activities but relieved by the meaning and ability to focus on their communities, Wikimedia, and other resources.
To achieve this, CRT is preparing to create Meta-Wiki pages to provide a platform for groups to monitor our impact and conversations with each other.
Keeping informed about COVID-19
We will be posting an invitation to our calendar on Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for an important staff meeting.
We will use this time to share with you new information, answer your questions, and spend time with each of you.
We are with you in this matter and will help you in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to follow this email newsletter, and other important information about COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will continue to update these pages and keep all information in one place.
We will also make every effort to keep in touch with our neighbors in the affected areas.
If you have any questions about travel, meetings, work, or coping with problems, or any other matter that requires assistance, please feel free to report and make your request to the CRT.
We are there to provide support and assistance when needed.
If you have a confidential or important matter, contact Bryan Judan - Global HR Director.
No one should view these changes as a way to relinquish our responsibilities and work.
It is, however, an acknowledgment that in this period our work and responsibilities will change in ways that have never been done before.
These are steps we believe are necessary to help each other keep working, provide our community with the support it needs, and serve a more trusting world.
Our work of repair will be waiting for us until it is finished.
Now is the time to help one another and to make room for the important work that is to come in the weeks and perhaps months ahead.
We need all of you to make it happen, so we ask that you all take care of yourselves and your families so that they are strong when the need arises.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
The program is presented by Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the entire team of directors (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme found on the surface of the cell membranes of the lungs, blood vessels, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 inhibits the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the concentration of angiotensin-II and increasing the concentration of ang(1-7) making it a potent drug for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 is also used to treat coronavirus infection.
The human enzyme is called hACE2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a metalloenzyme found in Zinx on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein is present in the N-terminal peptidase M2 and C-terminal of the viral amino acid transporter.
ACE2 forms the only membrane-bound protein type, with its activity as an enzyme on the surface of other cells and tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is translocated through the membrane by another enzyme called sheddase, after which the protein is secreted into the bloodstream and then excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is found in many organs: ACE2 binds to the cell membrane of the type II alveolar enterocytes of small intestine cells, endothelial veins and tendons and smooth muscle of muscle cells in organs.
ACE2 mRNA is also present in the cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of aCE2 is to activate ACE.
ACE binds the angiotensin I hormones to the vasoconstriction of angiotensin II.
ACE2 is bound to the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine by angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-pPhe) and is hydrolysed by it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also bind to many peptides such as [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane embolization of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is implicated in Hartnup disease.
Like the transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the primary target of the coronavirus, as well as HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus from which SARS originated); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus from which COVID-19 originated).
In general, the binding of the S1 protein strand of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the ACE2 enzyme on the cell surface induces endocytosis and co-transmission of the enzyme virus to one of the endosomes within the cell.
This site of infection requires the S-protein modifying serine protease TMPRSS2, which is being investigated as a potential therapeutic agent. This induces some individuals to inject ACE2 into the cell, in an attempt to fight infection.
However, a small number of academic and legal societies have advocated that they should continue with recommended ACE and ARB therapy.
A systematic and meta-analysis study published on 11 July 2012 found that treatment with ACE reduced the risk of pneumonia by 34%.
However, the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE who were at higher risk of pneumonia, such as those with heart failure.
ACE treatment was also associated with reduced pneumonia mortality, but the results were less robust than those for pneumonia risk.
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is a novel therapy for acute respiratory distress, and has been used to treat pulmonary hemodynacia and oxygen saturation in pigs with lypopolysaccharemia in acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is 10 hours and will be active for 30 minutes to 24 hours.
Several studies suggest that rhACE2 may be a potential treatment for patients with renin-angiotensin-resistant (RAS inhibitors) or high circulating angiotensin receptors. rhACE2 is being studied clinically for the treatment of respiratory distress.
COVID-19 apps are mobile apps designed to track potential cases of infection during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic.For example, how to identify (people) who may have been in close contact with an infected person.
Many applications have been developed, with government support in other places.
Many forms of surveillance have been developed by mobile phone applications.
Humans are not as intelligent as the systems that track people's location.
The least noticeable of the privacy issues is the Bluetooth signal that will tell a person if they are near other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would be adding support for the Bluetooth application to both Android and iOS.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, developed an app that helps local residents identify if they have been in close contact with a person with COVID-19.
It is being done in 200 cities in China, Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being developed.
The app was developed by IT experts in the country, released for public use and will be made available to the government. North Macedonia has launched StopKorona!, a Bluetooth app that will track the health of infected people and support the government's fight against the virus.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology in the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was pending approval by Google Play and Apple's App Store.
On 12 April, the government announced that the application for surveillance was fully developed, and will be available in the coming weeks.Another application is being developed in Ireland, and in France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering using Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia is developing an app that will screen COVID-19 patients living in Moscow, to be used for out-of-home surveillance.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has identified several potential issues with these application systems, including the potential for false positives, and the difficulty of accessing them because the application can only serve a local community.
Due to concerns about the potential impact of the coronavirus app, Apple has limited the number of organizations that can upload apps to the App Store, limiting them to employees of "government" or other well-known organizations.
Google and Amazon have also implemented these policies.
People who have fought for the right to privacy to monitor, wonder if the facilities are safe and if they will be destroyed after the coronavirus
Amnesty International and 100 other organizations called on lawmakers to monitor the people affected.
The organizations listed seven recommendations that governments can follow:
I will observe vigilance in a responsible and orderly manner.
There must be a time to end the vigil;
The count will be limited to COVID-19;
They should record people's names and faces and should not be shown doing so;
Computer surveillance should not be carried out in the midst of hatred;
To allocate the number of people outside the work to be provided by the written orders;
It must be in a way that protects the community and helps if someone is harmed by this worker;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also wrote their own recommendations.
The plan by Google and Apple would draw attention to the need to remove the system when it is no longer needed.
Other communities have helped to track people through a search engine rather than an app, which does not require an app and can avoid surveillance.
In Israel, the use of the retina was legalized.
Looking at a location grid is also a form of distraction.
However, not all systems should be able to track a person's location; many systems that monitor people's movements are built on intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, they have been able to keep track of what people don't need to have an app.
In the application, information was collected from multiple sources including telephone, credit cards, and was used to alert people to possible infections via SMS.
And passers-by were notified, and the government made the site publicly known, which is a good legal action because it was done in the context of the MERS pandemic in the country.
Information that is publicly available on many apps and websites. Countries such as Germany have been using an internal system to monitor the population.
As of 6 April 2020, it has not been released.
Surveillance has been well documented, with several studies since 2013.On 7 April 2020, more than a dozen students were developing systems that would monitor the presence of people, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to alert a phone if it is near another.
However, PEPP-PT is an internal and external workforce, and there is no formal recommendation to implement it. External protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact (TCN. fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Tracking People by Telephone.
With these protocols, no personal information is released, and everything is done over the phone.
Group Prive and MIT Media Lab are developing SafePaths, a platform to use data security to help locate and monitor contacts to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
It was developed from the white paper Apps Gone Rogue: Protecting privacy in a pandemic  Released in March 2020. Another project was SafeTrade by Enigma MPZ, a company developing privacy technologies that started as a research project at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrade enables automated data storage technologies to allow individuals to choose whether to share their location and health information with other individuals and government agencies, but does not enforce data retention policies.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was launched with a consensus on a common platform, to make it easier for people to access, and to facilitate global interoperability through tracking and alerting applications, which was essential for the global adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had BlueTrace protocols in place for its government employees.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the makers of Android and IOS, announced a project to support the surveillance of users while protecting their privacy, based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptographic technology.
They have also published a white paper outlining the technology that will be used.
For Apple and Google, the system will be built in three steps:
Developing a new application for the surveillance of citizens to help the government protect the privacy of citizens.
Installing it on IOS and AndroidGoogle and Apple want to control privacy by installing the system on their operating systems, and then removing it in the same way
Drug therapy (also called curative medicine) is the administration of a drug to treat a disease or condition for which it was prescribed.
It is a term of scientific study being explored in order to develop a successful vaccine for COVID-19.
Other studies are underway to investigate vaccines for COVID-19 and plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has 66 vaccines, all of which have a binding ligand.
Identifying the areas of contact provides a practical tool for detecting the severity of COVID-19 infection.
For SARS-CoV-2 the most important proteins are the sequence of the protease papain, the RNA polymerase related to RNA, the helicase, the S protein, and the ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein and a team of researchers from a combination of multiple populations have identified a skeletal response to a vaccine that may lead to the search for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine as a potential treatment option.
Chloroquine is a medication that is used to treat immune system disorders.
On 18 March, WHO announced that Chloroquine and Hydroxycloroquine would be among four drugs in the United Nations' Vaccine Trials Network.
New York Governor Andrew Cumo announced that the State of New York will begin testing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on March 24.On March 28, the FDA approved the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate in the Emergency Use Assessment (EUA).
The FDA has not approved the vaccine for clinical trials but it has been approved in the USA as a clinical trial for high-risk patients who are hospitalized but cannot be treated.
The CDC states that the use, dose, and duration of hydroxychloroquine for SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown.
Doctors say they use this vaccine when there is no other treatment.
A turkey test being conducted in Istanbul is testing the effects of chloroquine when combined with zinc, Vitamin A, Vitamin C and Vitamin D.
Major studies are being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The medical school at NYU Langone is testing the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine.
In China, vaccine trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen showed that Favipavir was highly effective.
35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative within 4 days, but the average duration of the disease is 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive treatment.
In a Wuhan study of 240 patients with pneumonia, half were given favipiravir and half were given umifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency advised the public about the potential risks of the drug at the outset.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the vaccine in Japan, and will help the clinic to deliver the vaccine to university hospitals, where the vaccine will be administered to patients with COVID-19.
For South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe warned the Trump administration against buying the vaccine. The vaccine may be less effective in people with severe infections and high levels of the virus.

Remdesivir was developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg virus.Gilead Sciences found remdesivir to be effective in vitro against many phyllo-, pneumo-, paramyzo-, and coronaviruses.
One of the key features of the vaccine is its ability to inhibit the virus from becoming too virulent to cause serious disease and spread in humans.
One early study suggests that Remdesivir may be more effective. Several studies are underway, including two being conducted by the University of Cleveland; one for moderate-to-severe cases and the other for severe cases.
Three clinical trials are underway to identify Vitamin C for people with severe COVID-19; two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and one placebo-controlled trial (Italy).

The bCOVID-19 vaccine is not effective against the 2019 (COVID-19) virus.
No vaccine has yet passed the clinical trial stage, and much work is underway to develop a vaccine that will pass.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, a case virus, to be available for 18 weeks.
Five vaccines were in Phase I in April.
COVID-19 was detected in December 2019.
It became a major global pandemic in 2020, requiring significant funding and studies to develop a vaccine.
Several organizations are using the genome sequencing to develop a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2.
They said in April, CEPI's ability to find a vaccine is their ability to do it on a large scale, to do it in a large geographic area, and to get it to the world.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 technologies were in development by early 2020 to develop a vaccine that would be effective against COVID-19.
Several sites have completed Phase I safety testing of the vaccine:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Preparation of the phase I and candidate vaccines: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vectors (Phase I of the study and candida: CanSino biology, adenovirus of the 5 vector types)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, 115 vaccines were in early stages of development with 78 approved as projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others, but the public has little information on these (in development or in development).
Phase I-II trials evaluate the efficacy of a vaccine and conduct immunoassays, randomized control, placebo, and multicenter, and dose-response studies.
Phase III trials involve a large number of subjects and follow-up teams, and clinical trials to see if the vaccine is effective in preventing disease, all based on the efficacy of the administered dose.
Of the 79 vaccines in development as of early April 2020, 74 have not been developed in humans (they were still in clinical trials).

On 2 April 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported the test site of PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "the MNA-induced SRAS-CoV-2 S1 subunit of the vaccine was found to be highly antigen-specific antibody-resistant [in mice] as early as 2 weeks after vaccination".
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo's School of Pharmacy announced the development of a vaccine based on DNA obtained as a nasal spray.
In the use of animal feed, DNA is modified to be replicated in human mice to produce small amounts of non-infectious virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and universities joined forces to access IBM's supercomputers, and to integrate the cloud computing services of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, called non-specific effects.
This means they may have benefits after their illness has passed.
The Australian emergency response service will employ 4,170 health workers.
It is possible that the vaccines in question will not be safe and effective.
The first discovery to evaluate vaccines for COVID-19-specific use in animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, some laboratory animals, and monkey primates, points to the safety of Level 3 containment measures for handling live viruses, as well as international consensus on the use of safety standards.
Experimental vaccines against SARS and MERS have not been tested in human models.
Until 2020, no vaccine or vaccine exists to treat or prevent SARS and is administered safely and effectively in humans.
Following research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the development and development of new vaccines and therapies for SARS was a priority for regulatory agencies and public health agencies worldwide.There is no reliable vaccine for MERS.
The MERS outbreak, it was believed that the discovery of the newly discovered SARS virus would provide a valuable template for the development of vaccines and therapeutics for the treatment of MERS-CoV infection
As of March 2020, one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) had completed phase I human clinical trials, and three others were in development, all of them are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviral vector vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Posters on social media have promoted conspiracy theories claiming that the virus that causes COVID-19 was discovered and a vaccine was developed to combat it.
The patents posted on social media of the form being discussed are references to previous patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other types of coronaviruses such as the SARS coronavirus.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a viral infection caused by the respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SRAS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhea, sore throat, vomiting, abdominal pain.
The onset and duration of symptoms is usually about five days but can range from two to fourteen days.
Most cases have only mild symptoms, but some end with severe swelling and organ damage.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in the deaths of more than 153,000 people.
More than 568,000 people have been infected with measles. The virus is mainly transmitted between infected people, mainly through small amounts of saliva produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
The salivary glands also produce a respiratory tract, but they usually remain on the surface of the skin or in the throat with infection.
People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on the surface for up to 72 hours.
It is most common during the first three days of symptom onset, but prevalence may be present before symptoms appear and during the post-infection period. Standard diagnostic methods include reaction with real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in nasal swab.
The use of face masks is recommended for people suspected of having the virus and their caregivers.
The standards for public use of masks vary, with some authorities recommending against the use of masks, some recommending it, and some recommending it.
Currently, there is no vaccine or cure for COVID-19.
Regional outbreaks of disease have been recorded in dozens of countries on all WHO continents.
People who have been infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath.
Symptoms of the disorder include difficulty breathing, chest pain or pressure, loss of consciousness, awakening pain, and facial or facial discoloration; a doctor should be consulted immediately if such symptoms occur.
Small coughs, upper respiratory symptoms such as chest pain, runny nose or sore throat may be present.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been reported in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially showed only chest pain and palpitations.
In some people, the disease may result in liver failure, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but ranges from two to 14 days.
97.5% of infected individuals develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection.Reports suggest that not all infected individuals develop symptoms.
The reason for the asymptomatic diagnosis is not fully understood; however, early symptoms are thought to be associated with the disease.
The proportion of infections that are asymptomatic is currently unknown and under investigation, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases are asymptomatic in hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to classify asymptomatic cases with a daily dose on 1 April; of the 166 cases on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
The feces may contain a large amount of virus.
Harsh words are more offensive than normal words.
A Singaporean study found that a dry cough can cause a burp to be 4.5 metres (15 feet) long.
Although the virus is not primarily airborne, the National Academy of Sciences suggests that bioaerosol dispersion can be produced and that airborne extra-viral samples can provide positive samples for viral RNA.
Other surgical procedures such as catheterization and CPR can cause the breath to be absorbed into the air and then dispersed through the air.
The risk of transmission is low, and this risk is accepted at the local level. the virus is more vulnerable to transmission if people are symptomatic; therefore, transmission may occur before symptoms appear, which is a risk factor.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) says that it is not yet known how easily the disease can spread, with one person usually infecting two or three other people. The virus can survive on surfaces for long periods of time.
Specifically, the virus was found to survive on cardboard for up to one day, up to three days on polypropylene and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this is where the difference between humidity and temperature is most noticeable.
Soaps and detergents are also effective when used correctly; soap products cut through the grease layer, protecting the virus, removing it, and removing it from the surface or other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are available.In the Hong Kong study, saliva samples were collected within two days of admission to hospital.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed a higher viral load on the last day, while the sixth patient had a higher viral load on the second day of the test.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SRAS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three patients with a previously unrelated acute respiratory syndrome in Wuhan.
All strains of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are associated with a common coronavirus.
Except in humans, the virus is killed by the saliva, the head is split into protective bundles.SRAS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most susceptible organs to COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cell via angiotensin-convertant enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is predominantly found in the alveolar type II cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac arrest was reported in 12% of patients hospitalized with a stroke in Wuhan, China, and is more common in severe cases.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms increases, which is a systemic inflammatory response to the immune system's pain when the disease is severe, but myocardial infarction can also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are widely expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
An increased incidence of thrombosis (31%) and vascular thromboembolism (25%) has been observed in ICU patients with COVID-19 and may be associated with poor prognosis. COVID-19 mortality rates have been shown to be associated with diffuse alveolar lesion (DLA), and lymphocyte-based infiltrate inflammation in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 is tropic to ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In addition, pathogen-producing T cells from GM-CSF have been shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6 monocytes and the pathology of chronic liver disease in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrate has also been reported in surgery.
WHO has published a number of test protocols for the disease.
The standard method for assaying the site is real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is particularly useful for breath samples taken using a nasal swab and a throat swab; however, a nasal swab or a sputum sample may also be used.
The results will be mostly known in the next few hours or days.
Blood tests can be used, but this requires two blood samples taken two weeks apart and results without a small fast valve.
Chinese researchers were able to isolate the coronavirus and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories worldwide could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to detect the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody testing (a test that detects active antibodies and whether a person has previously been infected) was under development, but not yet in widespread use.
Chinese experience with the production of the test indicates that the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The US FDA approved the first screening test site on 21 March 2020 for human use at the end of the month.Diagnostic support teams at Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital evaluated the methods for detecting any clinical infectious diseases and epidemiological risk.
The multiline opacity of the mirror surface on both sides of the peripheral, asymmetric and lateral partitions is common in the first few cases.
Subpleural dominance, pleural pavement (swelling of the septale lobe with different alveolar fillings), and consolidation may occur when the disease progresses.
Only limited data have been available on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main findings of the autopsy were:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, consolidation of the liver and edema of the lungs.
Four common areas of painful abdominal pain may be found:
common: swollen stomach, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation and lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multinucleated squamous cells
acute: a disordered alveolar disorder (DAD) is a disorder of the alveolar exudates.
DAD is the source of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute hypoxemia.
The end of the leaf: the formation of exudates in the alveolar cavities and fibrosis of the interstitial membrane.
Blood: bound by the circulation of blood in the intravesicle (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Measures to prevent and reduce the risk of infection include staying indoors, avoiding public areas, washing hands with soap and water often for 20 seconds, using respiratory hygiene and avoiding contact with eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.
The CDC recommends masking the mouth and nose with a mask during the diagnostic process and recommends the use of hand-mask if the mask is missing.
True cleanliness after a cleanse and a kesia is required by the diligence.
The CDC recommends the use of face masks in public, in addition to limiting the spread of asymptomatic individuals.Social distancing strategies are designed to reduce the concentration of infected individuals and close schools and public places, limiting movement and closure of public places.
Distancing devices also show that people stay about 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
No vaccine is known to effectively prevent COVID-19. The development of an untested vaccine is expected to be completed by 2021 and hopefully, the key to curbing COVID-19 will be to try to slow the epidemic peak, which is called "curve flattening".
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds, after using the toilet or when their hands appear dirty, before eating; and after blowing their nose, coughing, and using a toilet.
It also recommends the use of 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizers, but only when soap and water are unavailable.In areas where hand sanitizers are not commercially available, the WHO has recommended the use of local formulations.
In these formulations, the oxidation is usually caused by ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help clean up the abnormal bowel movements with alcohol; it is "the most effective hand antiseptic".
They add glycerol to the moisture.
People will be helped by a range of support services including hydrotherapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected organs.
The CDC recommends that people think that they are the mother of the virus by wearing a simple face mask.
External membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory distress, but its effectiveness is still under study.
Personal hygiene and diet are also suggested to improve immunity.
Treatment support may be necessary for people with mild symptoms at the onset of the infection. WHO and the National Health Committee of China have published guidelines for treating people in the hospital setting for COVID-19.
Intensive care and pulmonology specialists in the U.S. have developed treatment options from a variety of agencies and free resources, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For these symptoms, some physicians may prescribe the use of paracetamol (acetaminophene) instead of ibuprofen in the initial attack.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care settings where aerosol-producing devices such as air ducts or hand-held ventilators are used.
For healthcare workers who are alerting patients for COVID-19, CDC will send a human kit to the Airborne Infection Response (AIIR) Centre in addition to standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne precautions. CDC has recommended the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Materials that may be used include: PPE, respirators or face masks, eye protection, and medical bags.Then, respirators (instead of face masks) are more desirable.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has issued a ban on the use of any type of respirator under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
It is designed to protect the wearer from wind, but its mobility and the ability to cut through the windpipe are not guaranteed in its use.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face masks or, in all cases, homemade masks.
The overall incidence of COVID-19 is not sufficiently high to require the use of mechanical ventilation or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases do.
The type of respiratory support for patients with COVID-19-associated respiratory illness is being intensively studied in patients in hospital, with evidence that the tube tube can be avoided by the passage of high-pressure air through the cannula or by positive pressure of two levels.
But it is not known whether either of these will provide the same benefits to patients who are seriously ill.
Some doctors recommend an intravenous ventilator if necessary, as this technique prevents the transmission of particles to the air through the nose using a high pressure airway. Severe cases are more common in older people (over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developing countries lack hospital beds for each person, limiting the health system to accepting the same number of COVID-19 cases per day as the number of patients admitted to hospital.
A study in China found that of the 5% of patients admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% were air-conditioned, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized for COVID-19 end up in the intensive care unit.
The mechanical ventilation is becoming more complicated due to the respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with COVID-19 and the oxygen supply is becoming more severe.
The ventilators are in a controlled mode with high PEEP required to maximize oxygen supply while minimizing the risk of airborne respiratory injury and chest discomfort.
High PEEP may be lacking in older ventilators.
Research into a treatment option began in January 2020, and several antiviral vaccines are currently undergoing clinical trials.
Remdesivir is proving to be the most promising.
Although new vaccines may not be available until 2021 for clinical use, many of the investigational vaccines are already approved for use in other clinical settings or are still in clinical trials.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO has recommended voluntary participation in the trial to ensure safety of the vaccine materials being developed.The FDA has granted a short-term exemption to survivors' plasma for trial treatment in cases where life is threatened or imminent.
It has not yet received clinical trials to prove it is safe and effective in treating the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to help combat the pandemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app has a history of identifying the contacki of the victim using the monitoring data to determine when the accident will occur.
Each user can also verify the status of three other users.
If the threat is detected, the app will not only send the person to quarantine but also alert local health authorities.High-resolution mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and medical technology are being developed to track contacts of the affected in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track mobile phone data of suspected coronavirus cases.
This measure was introduced to enforce quarantine and protect people who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared mobile phone data storage with Germany's federal agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to help detect and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has developed facial recognition technology to identify quarantine-breaking individuals.
Italy's regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he had been informed by mobile operators that "40% of the population will continue to be displaced".
The German government has conducted a week-long hackathon with over 42,000 participants.
Also, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for a high-tech strategy to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience isolation anxiety, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, or fear of the consequences.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying, "increased social isolation, social isolation, fear of pain, stress and lack of resources are the main factors that are affecting the lives of people with dementia".
The disease may progress more slowly with fewer symptoms than minor respiratory complications, such as a common cold.
Mild cases usually resolve within two weeks, but those with more severe symptoms may take three to six weeks to resolve.
Pregnant women may be at increased risk for infection with COVID-19 or with related viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 are lacking.In some cases, COVID-19 may affect the bladder and lungs.
In those severely affected, COVID-19 can develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory depression, sepsis or multiple organ damage.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, blood clots and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Adverse blood interactions, particularly prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of people hospitalized for COVID-19, while adverse kidney reactions were seen in 4% of the general population.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have elevated levels of kidney enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
Thus, patients sent to the ICU had an average of seven days between admission and death.
In the first case study, the median time from the onset of the first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a range of six to 41 days.
In a study conducted by China's National Health Commission (NHC), males had a pregnancy rate of 2.8% while females had a pregnancy rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of samples from the cadaver's liver revealed alveolar composition and fibromyxoid cell exudates from both kidneys.
Cytopathological changes of the virus were detected in the pneumocytes.
The picture of the lens is similar to the symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Of the 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, cardiac arrests were caused by elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to the March data from the United States, 89% of those admitted to hospital were pre-diabetic. Medical resources and socioeconomic conditions of the population may affect the mortality rate.
Estimates of the number of people who died from the disease differed due to changes in the rates, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The simple calculation of the population can cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, since the deaths were due to long-term illness, this would suggest that the mortality rate for these patients is low.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to suffer severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to receive intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.The fear arises from the long-term pain associated with the disease.
The chief of the Hong Kong General Hospital found a 20% to 30% reduction in liver strength in the survivors, and scans of the liver revealed organ damage.
This can also lead to acute post-operative syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether previous vaccination would provide effective and long-term immunity to people recovering from the disease.
Immunity appears to be achieved, despite the characteristics of other coronaviruses, but cases of people with COVID-19 were followed up with a positive test for the coronavirus at a later date in the reporting period.
Such cases are considered to be a reduction in the seriousness of the disease and are not a new phenomenon.
The virus is thought to be global and has appeared in nature, with a high rate of infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019 the most commonly reported cases are all cases of human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, states that the earliest date of symptom onset was 1 December 2019.
Official publications of WHO report that the first symptoms appeared on 8 December 2019.
The many years have been spent in the process of counting the number of people who have died.
These rates vary widely and time depend on the size of the sample, the healthcare system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health of the individual.
In late 2019, WHO assigned to patients ICD-10 reference codes of codes U07.1 for patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for patients with clinical or epidemiological diagnoses of COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The case-to-case ratio shows the number of patients with the number of diagnosed cases in the time interval between the time of administration.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global ratio of cases to cases of measles is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which is the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease who die from the disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which is the percentage of people diagnosed (diagnosed or undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound, but follow specific populations from the beginning of infection to the end of case.
Although not all people have developed antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people might have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a village of 4,600 people, 80 (1.7%) have died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread from Carnival celebrations, and affected young children, resulting in a low death rate and not all deaths from COVID-19 were classified as such.
In addition, the German health system was not overly stressed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as assessed by blood donors.
6900 (0.4% of the total population) are confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The pandemic rates and the rate of mortality differ between males and females.
The homicide rate is higher than that of the other studies conducted in China and Italy.
The percentage increased for men in their 50s, and the gender gap remained steady in the 90s.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for males and 1.7 percent for females.
The reason for the difference between the female and male is not fully understood, but it may be genetic and behavioral factors.
Immunological differences by sex, low cigarette use in males and the development of conditions related to mortality such as hypertension in younger age groups than in males may increase the incidence.
In Europe, 57% of the cases were male and 72% of the COVID-19 deaths were male.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not linked any COVID-19 cases to the data.
Evidence suggests that viral infections such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
An increasing percentage of healthcare workers, particularly nurses, are bus drivers, which is why they are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization confirmed on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease will be "COVID-19".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that CO is for coronavirus, VI is for virus, D is for disease, and 19 years of transmission was first reported: 31 December 2019.
It is recommended to avoid fingerprinting in a specific geographic area (e.g., China), specific country or community, in a series of international referrals to provide a reminder to prevent stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called respiratory syndrome syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO is increasingly using the term "COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in its communication to the public.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
At the time of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus of the disease was both called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO designated 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV respiratory illness as the reference names for both virus and disease based on the 2015 recommendation instead of the previously selected names for disease and virus.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
In addition to the standard medical device manufacturing line, some digital fabricators are also printing medical equipment such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital had an emergency ventilator valve that its staff could not deliver on time, a local company used reverse engineering and printed 100 valves needed in one night.
Following the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories and fake news about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease quickly spread on the Internet.
Humans have been shown to have the ability to transmit viruses to other animals.
The study failed to detect evidence of viral reproduction in pigs, rabbits, and others.
There are no approved drugs or vaccines to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines is being conducted by governmental organizations, academic institutions and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to study the effects of treatment with a combination of antiviral agents that offers strong promise of relief.
A vaccine has not yet been developed, but several agencies are working to develop a vaccine that can be approved.
The first work on the cause of SARS-CoV was performed in the laboratory, and both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three main vaccination strategies that are being explored.
First, the researchers focused on the development of a complete viral vaccine.
The viral response of this species, either mutant or viral, is thought to accelerate the immune response of the human body to the new COVID-19 strain.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, seeks to develop a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to the actual subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this finding is attributed to the S-spicule proteins that allow the virus to enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new technology to improve vaccination).
Vaccines developed using these strategies need to be tested for safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccines contain no genetic code of the disease that is copied from the virus that causes the disease. The efficacy of antibody-dependent vaccines is currently being considered in the field of the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this is still a matter of debate.
More than 300 clinical trials are underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials are studying approved treatments for malaria, and four are studying hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The new antiviral drugs are the focus of a large number of Chinese studies, with nine phase III trials of remdesivir being conducted in several countries and reporting in late April.
The dynamic clinical trial of a vaccine for COVID-19 with a potential approved vaccine is expected to be completed by April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being studied for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
Signs of remdesivir's effectiveness began to appear in March 2020.
Improvements in clinical well-being were seen in patients treated with remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the U.S., China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was originally used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with initial releases.
However, it is feared that the intellectuals will be able to unravel the secrets of memory.
Health authorities in Korea and China have also been advised to use chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, when administering one dose of gamma-toxin daily, advises that two of these doses are highly toxic and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued a safety warning for use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the privacy of physicians treating COVID-19 patients. Chinese version 7 also added interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir to treat COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are important for controlling SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been proposed for in vivo follow-up studies after demonstrating low concentrations of SRAS-CoV-2 inhibition.Studies have suggested that the introduction of a specule-like protein precursor using transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is of particular importance for the transmission of SRAS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have severe limitations that have led the pharmacological community to reject therapeutic alternatives without follow-up studies.Oseltamivir does not directly interact with SRAS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known activity in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine fever may be the most severe end stage of severe COVID-19.
These indications suggest that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine properties.Tocilizumab has been withdrawn from the clinical trial by the National Health Commission of China after completion of a small study.
Phase 2 non-randomized trials are currently underway at a national level in Italy after showing positive results in patients with severe disease.
The combination with a blood test for serum ferritin for the disease, has been shown to inhibit growth, which is thought to be the cause of death in the affected population.
The interleukin-6 inhibitor was approved by the FDA in all of the clinical trials conducted prior to the treatment of refractory steroid cytokine withdrawal syndrome for a different purpose, the CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized or controlled evidence to support that tocilizumab is a true cure for CRS.
Transfer of purified and co-concentrated antibodies from the immune system of survivors of COVID-19 to those who need them is monitored for both non-vaccine and passive immunization methods.
This device has been tried and has failed.
Viral neutralization is the predicted pathway by which passive antibody therapy will be able to achieve a significant level of immunity to SARS-CoV-2.
However, other pathways, such as cytotoxicity and/or antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis may be involved.
Alternative forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, the use of engineered monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
Serum samples from patients with the disease, including partial blood samples from healthy individuals and antibodies specific to the virus, may be used to isolate the virus.
