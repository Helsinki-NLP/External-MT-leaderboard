This not only confirms the fact that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as their colours and three-dimensional arrangements.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brownish-brown at the top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides a first glimpse into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a highly developed structure, called a scaly tail, but instead have other feather features  barbels and barbels  the researchers concluded that the scaly tail was probably a later evolutionary development than those other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but for temperature regulation or visualization.The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the scapula shows adult plumage and not a pole.
The researchers suggested that, although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the scapula showed adult plumage and no plumage.

The work done was essentially theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal force between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a similar force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of corona, and is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the candidate they have chosen in an envelope.
After verification by voting officials of the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the urn and signs the list of voters.
French electoral law rather strictly codifies the procedures.

Deputy Inspector General D K Arya stated, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer".
The accused are designated as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The route where the accident occurred was temporarily blocked while emergency services were releasing the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of his son.
She is detained pending her indictment and trial, but all eyewitness evidence may be tainted by the fact that her image has been widely published.
It is a common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice operates differently and the courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee remarks "journalists really seem to be walking a dangerous line when they post suspicious photos and stuff".
The Crown Office, which deals with prosecutions generally, has advised the press that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the escort, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on those before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that would be addressed include the future state of Jerusalem which is sacred to both nations and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement is signed while the PA agrees to leave such a presence for only five years.
The participants of the supplemental control trial of our populations were to be closely monitored by the guards, provided that the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of conservation and heritage at the park with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunt operation received complete safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in before a new nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP) yesterday.
He is Martelly's fifth CEO in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures that will lead the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread demonstrations opposing the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some due since 2011.
About 60 booths overheating dysfunctional iPods were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been made aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company has described as "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in reporting "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 am local time (9:19 pm GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Bureau stated that no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer holds Hong Kong tourists hostage while derailing their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fires his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages were rescued and at least six of them have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the town hall.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at Liggins Hospital, she began studying premature labor during her spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered it would speed up the fetal lung of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Moon was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Moon got through the night of the two moons. She's truly unique just like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as troubled as I was... maybe even more so... I love her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard reasserted during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those polled share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the poll's extreme, 29 percent of people polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent of them believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim in the 100 and 200-meter freestyle and three-relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaints, her physical condition was called into question.
He was unable to take the medication needed to overcome his pain as it was banned by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest prime ever on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using computer hardware and software in early February and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets may possibly have been the source of the Earth's water supply along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, particularly how the Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "blah blah political and stupid".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older technology based on ground-based radar to allow air traffic controllers to determine the position of an aircraft with greater accuracy and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is added and surface trains will not stop at Wembley and parking and relay parking facilities are unavailable on the ground.
Fear of a lack of transport raised the possibility that he would be forced to play the game at barricaded gates without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird on the equatorial islands of the Galapagos.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to take longer, due to the breeding between an endemic Darwin's pincer, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus pincer, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be well rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled to form a fine thread, which can be twisted and drawn. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and embedded in another metal. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
It's called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red clove juice.
The color of cauliflower juice changes depending on the degree of acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical product being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their protons removed from them (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Gather all two dry powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, boil them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will give you a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had communes with water in almost every house, linked to a sophisticated roofing system.
Remains of roof systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also communes in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, communes were sometimes a part of public bathing houses where men and women were gathered in mixed company.
Before you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back to Earth, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It uses a giant rocket over 100 feet high to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The most important thing the wheel has done for us is to give us a much easier and faster means of transportation.
It has brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are smaller cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic stray cats) that eat the vast majority of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the capelette, a special job that each cat has and that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large, roasted groups.
Lion groups are composed of one to three adult males of the same family, together with as many as thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds act like wolf packs or cubs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other felines) in behavior, and also extremely deadly to their prey.
A well-trained athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-voice roar of the lion, but rather like a phrase of rattled, unruly words.
The birds like to eat small animals. If they are able, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Most of the animals that the birds hunt are much smaller than it.
Scientists think that the ocelots follow and find animals to eat (catch) by their smell, narrating where they have passed on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and also move very stealthily. The ocelots hunt their prey by blending with their surroundings.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (such as by passing a mountain range or a river, or by moving to a new island in such a way that they cannot easily return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different resources and rivals, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they needed before.
The original population has not changed, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, both populations will appear so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Specificity is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants take their food from the sun by photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We make our homes out of plants, we make our clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The mosasaur was the most important predator of its time, and therefore feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra layer in the roof of its mouth, meaning that there was no way to escape anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it is possible that he was at least a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that was in the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex could not resist it.
And while most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual celebration items, which included spiders, peacocks, cockroaches, and a type of rodent called a missara.
Another difference was that while the poor and women would eat their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men would enjoy banquets together where they would be scattered on the edge of time while they ate their food.
The pasture of the ancient Romans may not have included foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a pie.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered to be the god's home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to provide for the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, were built to be a part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the home was not so important.
Most of the Jewish family life was conducted in the open air.
Women did the cooking in the courtyard; the shops were just open cutlery stalls on the street.
There were no significant forests in the land of Canaan, and wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled, and it is told in Norse sagas that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, when he travelled further west, found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But beyond his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it is not true, and although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the reverse of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, on the reverse.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in his life, this large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
And so, it is likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The landings of D-Day, and the ensuing battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the French of "Vichoi", who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
Within just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning toward Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, a cognate of the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and which also defines in some way the dimension of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizational culture involves the passing of knowledge over several generations, a persistent cultural weight, and equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as civilizations in their own right.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - Congress was its sole constituent - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no powers to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its decisions.
It also had no authority to pass tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended and the states took over the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful football team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the scattered islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geographic point of view, as an "archipel".
The origin of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Formosa Island, or Polished Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, initiating a transformation in native grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work in its rice fields and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the coastal regions of western and northern Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still photography worldwide is 35mm, which was the dominant film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image-capture formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, in a somewhat surprising way, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is thus said to be 3:2.
Many frequent formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is bravely abused and often ridiculed, is a simple guide that creates dynamism while preserving a measure of order in an image.
He states that the most effective approach for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was the subject of a serious examination.
For more than a millennium, the Christian religion had held the European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the villain.
One of the main Christian tenets is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary resources of the church are specifically there for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money caused many people to question whether this principle was being respected.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain launched a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent all ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, causing further danger to neutral vessels.
Since there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his employer in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing different time periods; each stage of China or each ruling family represented a distinct dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty, the most notable of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods a fierce war was fought between many nobles who were vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Even after the Revolution the professions were open to all male candidates allowing the most ambitious and brightest to succeed.
The same is true for the military because instead of having class-based army classifications, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the repressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to attend a pilgrimage which became known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (the Light) for contemplation.
The balm itself, which has survived through time, gives a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Perched atop one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the balm is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even if you knew it existed. Once inside the balma, it is a complete isolation.
Nothing is visible without the clear, beautifully rounded sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. Not much of this world can be seen or heard from inside the balm.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramidal structures built to honor the dead pharaoh.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Khofo and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor Khofo's wives and family members.
The "high arch" mark looks like a V and the "low arch mark" looks like a graph or a square that is missing the bottom.
Up means you should start at the punch and throw the arrow, and down means you should start at the hook (which is where your hand holds the arrow) and throw the arrow.
A high bow usually generates a softer sound, while a low bow is louder and more assertive.
You should feel free to make your own markings with a chalkboard, but remember that printed marks are here for a musical reason, so they should be customarily respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 were sent back from Versailles to Paris by a crowd of women from the market.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and shouted threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to have the windows of his carriage completely open.
At one moment a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in the face of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to return money from a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Certainly, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The time period in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 BC).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological jumping off point or the technological imperative to a strict sense that man's destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes well beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be argued that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However a national road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, and therefore new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new sleeping techniques to repair bodily damage.
Romanticism had an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture associated with that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was perceived as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 CE and lasted until about 1100 CE.
Their status declined during the 12th century mainly because the crusaders were returning with gifts such as silks and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
Gothic art reached its zenith during the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
The dress was initially heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of slow communication channels, styles in the west could resonate as early as 25 to 30 years ago.
By the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the major advances of the period was the use of buttons to tie clothes as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is performed by producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using seeds harvested from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically many peasants were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which may include fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most frequently used methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, because of neglect, misbehavior or deliberate mistreatment, were not socialized by adults during the time they were growing up.
Some wild children have been confined by individuals (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of children was due to the rejection by the parents of a child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have suffered severe violence or trauma during their childhood before being abandoned or fled.
Others were supposedly raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When completely overwhelmed by non-human animals, the feral child manifests behaviors (within its physical limits) almost completely similar to those of the particular animal adopting it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
And while project-based learning should be the easiest and most interesting learning, it's going a step further.
The impont is not a learning method but rather an aid that provides support to individuals experiencing a novel learning experience such as by using a new computer program or by starting a new project.
Thumbnails can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of thumbnail but it is also the case with the Microsoft Office trombone man.
Virtual Points are internalized in the software and function to question, prompt, and explain processes that may be too complex for the student to manipulate alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, to even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.
We perceive the Foster Care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster family system is supposed to provide safe homes, caring care staff, stable education and reliable health care.
Host families are supposed to provide all the needs that were missing in the home from which they were taken in advance.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for Internet employment (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continuous relationships were also identified as novel aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, pointed out how people who were unable to understand a speech because of brain damage were still able to estimate sincerity accurately.
It further suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the reservoir of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination blend the two-way variation between all two reservoirs at each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to humans to meet its amino acid needs from the resources available in plants.
It has, or does not have, serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the accessible proteins in leaves and vegetables, but they are poorly digested by primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, chickens, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide high amounts of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" to some extent in the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a little later (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively discreet revelation to bring you into consciousness without completely awakening you.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm during your sleep, it may be placed on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is correlated in an opposite way to the amount of tension of body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of that is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but they were spread through the Mahayana love path and through the techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is basically quite simple, consisting of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With kundalini yoga the kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. Since the end of the war, confrontations of systems, processes and culture have led to a rupture between these countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought outright, with proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts following the invasion of eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport products is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and products across oceans.
The job of the navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move people and goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to move men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which used mostly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it had done with the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated some 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pasture areas, often overseen by shepherds who were often children or adolescents, similar to the generally better-known shepherds.
Hippo-mobile railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the horse-drawn railways consisted of simply parallel wooden posts, they allowed the horses to pull at higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Crosses were introduced early to keep the rails in place, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more effective if an iron band was placed over them.
This became common practice, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first all-iron railings were introduced.
The earliest known means of transport was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning "upright man").
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not walk straight as they usually did.
Bipedal specialization is found on Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can become activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
It's not just as a symptomatic treatment in many cases, however, if we don't want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problem, and we should deactivate it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed greatly because of humanity's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have become greater because of humanity's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks further to John Dunlap's printing press.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap leaves".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of these was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap leaves that are known to exist are the oldest copies of the document that have survived.
Many paleontologists now believe that a single group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today.
Many people do not see them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still trace back to dinosaurs.
They have feet with spines and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have no more than two values, for example 0 or 1, and those numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent.Symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of an internal warming may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic chemicals in the home.
You should check the label for specific first aid instructions for this specific poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an ancient familiarity with cymes, which are highly adapted insects to parasitize humans.
Cimecs and killer cimecs are both nesting animals, adapted to live in a nest or the housing of their host.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the dominant neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to adopt a child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to discover the way the world works through the scientific method, which actually guides most scientific research.
However, it is not just that, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations that also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external signals, have been documented by most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycle even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments by either marking the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the size of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of taking advantage of the landscape, including flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns in cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport hub everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Science indicates that this massive carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about the quality of water or bridges that they are taking.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they not function properly on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they create with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult since the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
For example, conductors tend to behave in a reasonably consistent wind; thus, circulation currents tend to have some consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate way.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships aid in the planning, design, and operations of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to flee from their enemies more easily and to find food and partners more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small teeth to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemers.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed otherwise; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds strange, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the first largest river on Earth, carrying eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at about four miles (6 km) wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed for their size and technical excellence in their construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were admirers of the monuments of their predecessors, which were much older than a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of daily life for most of those who work in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, since they can all be found in nature in their native forms and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it was also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. You should not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
And so, the hedgehog was a good friend to many people when it first appeared.
It is sad but with the advent of new writing methods, the written word has been relegated to a low status and low employment.
People now write messages on computers or computer screens, without ever having to lock themselves with a scissors.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will be when something new arrives.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to throw together a nucleus and strong protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Fracturing will return the nucleus and then release some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they tend to separate with a tiny drop or even less.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the opposite side.
It is more submerged and more often low in the highlands.
There may be more sea on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what people choose or what is of interest to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized from the time they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what is there for certain people that makes them envious of the things they do and what things in their environment will or won't make them do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers start to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to stay "one of the guys" (or women).
This type of manager has difficulties in making unpopular decisions, in exercising disciplinary actions, in evaluating performance, in assigning responsibilities, and in holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, another becomes a poorly recognized individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and take ownership of it.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of his team.
This behavior often results in a rift between the managers and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often serve as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams may meet in variable time zones that may not be understood by their local administration.
The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the rules for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the laborious process of building a learning organization? Innovation is one of the goals when implementing organizational learning concepts.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the needs of the customer.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation and at the same time share knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to research on cognition, thus limiting the scope of research and making it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior validates the research of scientists.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction connotation, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, scheduling and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as writing, voice and face recognition.
Such things have come from separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, although it has been built into various computer applications and home video games.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom. It would often be a pleasure for a teacher to take his students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
Technology provides the solution with virtual tours, where students can look at artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also an excellent way to get involved in an excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and each year the website is remodeled, but older versions are kept online to serve as albums.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with neglected grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to make great efforts to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
At the same time blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to nurture the public's interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Using a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning beyond traditional school days.
Proper use of blogs "can stimulate students to become more analytical and critical; through active responses to Internet material, students can define their positions in the context of other's writings as well as highlight their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the vibrant bilingual capital of Canada and features a good array of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is much further south and north is the Muskoka Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and beyond.
All of these things and more still put Ontario in the spotlight in what is considered to be the quintessential Canadian for outsiders.
The larger expanses further north are rather sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness regions.
To make a population comparison that surprises many people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and one of the most isolated, wildlife-rich continents.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the territories, and it became a major presence in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began during the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the route from Cape Europe to India.
To the north the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: It is recommended that all female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that seems too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they might consider as being a bracelet and it is not unusual for them to be followed, held by the arm, etc.
You must be firm when rejecting men, and do not be afraid to defend territory (cultural differences or not, this is not normal!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1775.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and Spanish merchants who had established trading bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the ancient Medina it is easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tajinas, earthenware, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of such items, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the far eastern coast of Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city's streets, particularly the city centre.
And although Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside of Goma will need to be studied to understand the state of ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The town is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of Africa's least expensive mountain gorilla trails.
A boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi) can be used to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 CZK for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a polluted city, and although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stages during the Henry Louis Gates special Wonders of the African World on PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it has a more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the emblematic landmark of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there is a daily fee for preservation and entrance fees.
It may also be advantageous for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to either select parks within South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider as their main interest.
The staggering number of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a glossy graph of bars made apparent by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, you have to leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront in front.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is the land that the British colonists took as their own and so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, it is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest belt of coastal mangroves in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in the interior of Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps but comprise some of the last remaining patches of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water or swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 wild deer in the area.
Buses depart from the bus station between districts (across the river) throughout the day, although most, particularly those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
As buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by Japanese small Coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby destinations, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres, are 378 metres long and have two aisles of 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017 when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurus and Payaguas, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
During the 16th century Paraguay, which was formerly called "the giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquistadors with the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and players in the entire world.
The most important tournament of the year is held in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP) which is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, and although British and American currencies may be taken; check with landlords in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are frequent.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer would indicate.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
And although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be eaten or harassed.
According to park officials, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how much they look like, bison, wapitis, urchins, bears, and almost any other beautiful animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep an adequate distance.These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or carrying junk food and keep a field clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful concentration in the city resulted in the death of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland being sandwiched between two ports. The most popular are in three zones.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour District) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend as far as Long Bay in the north and Devonport in the south.
They are mostly sandy beaches where you can swim safely, and most have shady spots provided by pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They are sometimes very busy family beaches with a good range of shops lined up on the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is not a complex beer, but is tasty and refreshing.
There are plenty of French wines to choose from, but wines from New Zealand and Australia could travel better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is a good option if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the concept of flat white is foreign. A short black coffee is an espresso, the cappuccino is served with a thick layer of cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard, and fruit juices are expensive and excellent.
Many trips to schools are made throughout the year, and accidents due to any of these things on the schools are rare.
However, you should take the advice of the authorities, respect all the signs and pay close attention to the safety warnings.
Busted jellyfish appear along beaches and along river estuaries from October to April 1770 in the north.
Llamas do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most Llamas are afraid of humans and would run away by swimming.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat being in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep upon arrival at his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping grounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transport arrangements to and from the airport or even some packages that combine flights with hotels.
They can also save you the reservation if you need time to think about the proposal or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any such change or request should however be notified through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
In some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on-site, and most attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action you will need to get up early to get a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages may have ended, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping rounds for families with young children.
If you cross the North Baltic in winter, you should check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice causes a rather rough ride for the most affected people.
Cruise ships in St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos typically make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food and drink and entertainment proposals, to keep customers in good spirits, and to keep them in their seats.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on the spot, however, drunkenness alters judgment and all good gamblers know that it is important to stay sober.
Those who are driving at high latitudes or on mountain slopes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is weak and you cannot drive as if you were on the asphalt naked.
During blizzards, enough snow to immobilize you can fall in a short time.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or wind-borne snow, condensation or ice on the vehicle's windshield.
On the other hand, conditions under ice and snow are normal in many countries, and circulation is almost uninterrupted year-round.
Safaris are perhaps the most important tourist attraction in Africa and are the focal point for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to overland trips to observe the magnificent African wildlife, particularly the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to close up close to cars and standard equipment will allow for close observation.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are best seen with twins.
A walking safari (also called "walking in the bush", "excursion safari", or "footing") consists of walking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the 1964 games.
If you have booked your 2020 flights and accommodation before the report announcement, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most of the coronavirus cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most tickets for the competitions are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Lining wet clothes can help them dry.Many hotels have a fireplace and a lounge available for rent, although there are no gifts in the room.
If a grinding iron is not available or you are not keen to wear smooth coats, then you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause overheating, or in extreme cases, burning).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are a member, you should consider buying your water from a reputable bottle company.
Travelers may encounter wild animals that are not familiar to them in their regions of origin.
Smoking animals can chew food, cause irritation or, in the case of pests, cause allergic reactions, spread vermin or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, do not fall into the category of harmful causes.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy duty-free products and special taxes in certain areas.
Travelers heading to countries where tariffs are high can often save a considerable amount of money, particularly on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through isolated, heavily wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep a calm mind: steep ski slopes, narrow roads and winding turns predominate.
The posted speed limits are clearly lower than in the preceding and following sections  frequently 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 km/h)  and strict adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.
Interestingly, however, mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other portions of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cuisines are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruits in the pastries are frequent, with apples cooked in cocks all year round, and cherries and plums making their appearance during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cooks particularly do well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some smaller but rich pastries, try what depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, accompanied by either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the proportion of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found across the nation.
However, if used without qualifier, the term tends to mean food that is originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine has a wide range of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant flavors that Javanese favor are cocoa, peppers, sugar (particularly coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The striae are supports for the rider's feet that hang from either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider but can create safety concerns because of the potential for the rider's feet to get caught in them.
If a rider is ejected from a horse but has one foot caught in the stirrup, he may be stolen if the horse escapes. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, rather narrow sole.
Then some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a sturgeon to fall from the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and boulders.
The peaks include impressive views from the peaks, and climbers from all parts of the world continually establish new routes between its endless potential walls.
Snowboarding, which includes skiing and snow surfing, are popular sports that involve skating on snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski vagabonds", planning entire ski-centric holidays in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings depicting skis date back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century and, in 1861, the first leisure ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, hiking skiing or skiing excursion.
It is a relative but usually does not include alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter done on steep terrain and requiring skis and much stiffer boots.
You have to think of a ski route as a similar itinerary to a hiking trail.
Under good conditions you can cover relatively longer distances than by walking but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy bag on paved tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through multiple countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport checks many times.
The Schengen area, however, functions to some extent as a country in this case.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross the border without going through any points of passport control.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member countries separately, and you will save time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured objects are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
This definition is subject to geographical variations, as the age limit may be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Craft products could be defined as old, even if they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important source of resources among the Sami and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many who practice other professions.
More traditionally, not all Sami have participated in large-scale reindeer farming, but have subsisted from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, keeping reindeer primarily as game animals.
Today many Sami people work in modern businesses. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami country.
Although it is commonly used, particularly among non-Roma, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is the subject of travel recommendations, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments that are not your own, although their advice is meant for your citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face situations different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
Travel advice is simply a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Inclement weather is the generic term for any type of weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Inclement weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of inclement weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea thunderstorms, and cyclones.
Violent regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risks of severe weather that may affect their area as it may affect all their travel plans.
Those planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should follow professional training.
An Internet search for 'hostile environment courses' will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course must normally cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with some practical experience.
A course will normally last between 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing games, many elements of first-time experiences and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wilderness are frequent, but publications dealing with war zones are scarce.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they carry valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with the gender not indicated (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is simply variable everywhere.
Security checkpoint scams have also become much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Preoperative transgender people should not expect to go through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
The rip currents are the backflow of the waves that rise from the beach, often to a school or something nearby.
Because of the underwater topology the return flow is concentrated in a few deep sections, and a rapid flow towards the deep waters can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of the fatigue of trying to swim to shore against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, it is no more difficult to swim back in than it is normally to swim.
Try to head somewhere where you won't be trapped again or, depending on your abilities and if you've been spotted, you may want to wait for rescues.
The return shock arrives faster than the culture shock (and less than a honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had ease to adapt to their new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readapt to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the habits of your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning to their homes.
The sound and light show is one of the area's most interesting activities for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
You usually hear the sounds of tourists and vendors for a long time. The history of sounds and lights is simply like a storybook.
The Sphinx serves as both the backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the different pyramids are alluded to.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and hold the most bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 75 miles (120 km) north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the village of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region to the south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula fuse into the plateau, and then re-emerge to form the Ellsworth Mountains range, cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which culminates at 4,892 m (14,890 ft) from Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, which requires you to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that handle data and voices.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a sabbatical year is to travel to learn.
It is particularly popular for those who drop out of school, which allows them to take a sabbatical year before university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling for a gap year in study abroad can actually improve your chances of entering higher education once you return to your home country.
There will generally be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent boating destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
In the archipelago and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
And while coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are large enough for all types of yachting, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This coincides with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example in the Netherlands the number is one in forty).
Most of the various Baltic Cruises include a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days and then sleep on the boat again for the night.
If you land only as part of the ship's excursions you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany in brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea and a tour of the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and circumstances, particularly if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and aversions of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or being unable to control anything.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly, often time is of the essence for business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger airlines have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller firms there was a problem.
If the goods were shipped by air freight, on some itineraries, it may take days to go through the unloading and customs stages.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as baggage in the suitcase. Airlines regulations will not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, which is where it is included.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to spend a good amount of money for this privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
However, it is not a good market: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal price in economy class for business class and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no point in looking for discounts for business class or first class seats on direct flights from point A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of dollars for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and are billed accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member states.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
Formerly the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and busy centre of commercial operations, set around an immense bay and surrounded by mountains.
The broad alleys, glass-faced buildings and modern shopping centres are lined with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market and the old mosques and churches, although the city has a more Mediterranean European than traditional Turkish atmosphere.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighbouring island of Øysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble dove sculptures on some graves.
It's worth a half hour's walk into this strange village.
To the north is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which was made famous by foreigners after a mild account of its splendors was documented by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north you also have to visit the great Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (holy place), a place of world famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are visiting primarily a mass grave site and also a site that has almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many living men and women who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or who worked there to their death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make any jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not degrade the site by writing or graffitiing on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, a vast majority understand it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most panels are indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disturbances are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
And while it's often not just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get around Paris is still to prove your best behavior, by acting like someone who's "well-educated", which will make getting around Paris considerably easier.
The steep exterior of Parisians will evaporate quickly if you do a few basic courtesies.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with faunas, beech and oak trees, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils and variable altitude levels.
The Rhode Island also harbors an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, stork, lynx, feral cat and wild peacock can be found, as well as several other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear gonels that cover their knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide scarves for women who are not prepared, but if you wear your own, particularly one with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
In the same way, men were required to wear trousers that covered their knees.
This can also be taken out of the back-up at the entrance but this dress is not washed after each use and so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
Malhorc cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean expanses, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (usually pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple popular dinner, especially during the summer, is the oil loaf: Bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any kind of accompaniment available such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, together with the word for you, always begin with a capital letter, and often in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It undoubtedly makes reading easier, and although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to discover if a verb or adjective is used in a substantiated form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The main letters to which attention should be paid are c and g, although their pronunciation varies depending on the next vowel.
Also, be sure to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means car, while carro means car.
It is given a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introduction to grammar will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the sentences.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know some Spanish may conclude from the list that Portuguese is close enough that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums, or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not the kind of problem they are today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to reach than those built during the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are large installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Watching cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where the flowers of pruniers were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were hosted by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look better when they are in a natural environment, so you have to resist the temptation to only remove "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formal landscaped garden, picking up a few "specimens" will also make you leave, no question.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to go and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything there as soon as you get there.
But since it is located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator you will have to manage both heat (often) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, rarely).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
You need to check that the bus you plan to take is going to Hebron and not just to the neighboring Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good base theme for vacations.
Examples include visiting the castles of the Leire valley, the Rhine valley or cruising to interesting sites on the Danube or taking a boat on the Erie Canal.
They also define itineraries for popular hiking and bike trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Several of the traditions surrounding the holidays have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries worldwide.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake in some exposed spot to watch the sun rise.
There are certainly Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
Most traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night during Easter morning, with some congregations often beginning the celebration as early as midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands arrived either by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the long distance from the mainland the mammals were unable to make the journey which made the giant tortoise the main animal to patrol the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced to the islands including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and puppies.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good chance of seeing the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark more or less continuously.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore not often a problem, you will also be able to take advantage of the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are accustomed to.
The customs are standard work clothes and colleagues are addressed by their surname or by their title of office.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group effort rather than praising individual performance.
Employees must often obtain the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
