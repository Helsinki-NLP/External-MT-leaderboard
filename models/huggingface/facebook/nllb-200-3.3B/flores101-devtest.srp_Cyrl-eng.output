In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, this gives us details that fossils in principle cannot, such as color and three-dimensional configuration.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were a shaped brown color on the top and pale or cartenoid on the underside.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur's feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but have other features of the feathers  spines and spines  researchers have concluded that the rachis probably evolved later in evolution than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature regulation and display. The researcher's view is that, although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen suggests that it is the feathers of an adult individual, not a juvenile.
The researchers noted that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows the feathers of an adult individual rather than the feathers of a bird.
A car bomb that exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than twenty others.

The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rosby number of the star, which refers to the flow of the plasma.
The smaller the Rosby number, the less active the star is in the domain of its magnetic reversal.

The work done is largely theoretical in nature, but the program is written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that his team was looking for would be produced by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
By the same principle that the Moon pulls the Earth, causing tides and currents, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter just as ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around the galaxy is arranged around the galaxy in a sort of halo, and is composed of many tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll has discovered XDR-TB in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He said in an interview that the new strain was "extremely problematic and disturbing because of the high mortality rate".

In France, voting is traditionally very simple in terms of technology: the voters go alone to the booth and put the printed ballot with the designated candidate in an envelope.
Once the official confirms the voter's identity, he inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
France's electoral law very strictly codifies the protocol.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there is no envelope at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added except those of duly registered and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to attend each part of the process.

Police Superintendent Chanda Shekhar Solanki stated that they appeared in court relaxed with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car struck it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road on which the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Padgett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
No one has since been charged in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, but any witness evidence could be compromised given that her picture has been published in many media outlets.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently and the courts consider the publication of the photographs potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observed: "Journalists seem to be treading a dangerous line if they publish images of suspects or otherwise".
The Scottish Public Prosecution Service, which has general jurisdiction over criminal prosecutions, told reporters that there would be no further comment at least until the charges were dropped.
According to leaked information, the document will address the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics covered reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian authorities agree that the presence exists for only five years.
The shooters in the damage control action were to be under the strict supervision of the ranger, given that the action was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Through a partnership between the NPWS and a corporation called the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers are recruited into the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program.
According to Mika Offlin, acting director of park and heritage protection for the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
The new nine-member Electoral Commission (CEP) was sworn in yesterday under Martelly.
It is Martelly's fifth electoral commission in four years.
Last month the presidential commission recommended the previous resignation of CEP as part of a package of measures to launch the country towards new elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Violent protests have occasionally been caused by the non-respect of elections, some of which have been in place since 2011.
There were some 60 reported cases of overheating of faulty iPods, leading to a total of six fires, but also minor burns in four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said that it was aware of 27 accidents involving such devices.
Last week, METI announced that it had been notified by Apple of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "insignificant".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in reporting "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 am local time (9:19 pm GMT Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management in the Northern Mariana Islands said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there was no tsunami warning.
A former Filipino policeman held tourists hostage in Hong Kong by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Ronaldo Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages were rescued and at least six have so far been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly lady who needed a toilet.
Lygins followed in his father's footsteps and began to build a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research preterm labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the use of hormones could accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" containing flight records on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away in the night two months. Pretty unique in her likeness. A strong woman".
Dustin Goldstein Runnels commented: "The Moon was just as strange as I am...maybe even more so...I love it and will miss it...I hope it is in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose 8 percent from 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of the respondents share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
In an extreme poll, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100 and 200 metres freestyle in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints raised doubts about his fitness.
He was unable to take the pain medication he needed because it was banned at the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software by early February, and on Tuesday it was announced.
Comets may have been the source of water that reached Earth along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets have been colliding with the Earth since ancient times.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
There is public talk that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to earlier technologies based on ground-based radar, to enable air traffic controllers to determine the position of an aircraft more precisely and to provide pilots with more accurate data.
No additional transportation that is placed on overhead trains will be stopping at Wembley, and parking lots and "parking and vehicle" type facilities are not available above ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the teams' fans.
Research published Thursday in the journal Science reports the creation of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is believed to take much longer, following mating between the endemic Darwin's hare, Geospiza fortes, and the introduced cactus hare, Geospiza contris coniros.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes.
It can be worked into thin wires, which can be twisted or braided, and it can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It may be made in a very thin form, as well as glued to some other metal, and it may be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate pictures in books known as "illuminated manuscripts".
You can make an indicator using the juice of a red cabbage.
The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on whether the chemical is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH level refers to the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
The hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, and then squeeze them into a ball with wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of wrapper.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had WC cups in almost every house, which were connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of the sewer system have been found in houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were once part of public baths, where men and women were in the same company together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call and then sends it back down at almost the same time.
Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere reflects some of the light and images.
Sending a satellite or telescope into space requires a huge rocket, over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest thing it has done for us is to make transportation much easier and faster.
This brought us a train, a car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging cats) that eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of an ecological niche, a special job each cat performs that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable of the cats, and they live in large groups known as flocks.
The flocks consist of one to three adult males in a litter, followed by up to thirty females and juveniles.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion hounds behave similarly to wolves or dogs, animals that are strikingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) and are also very deadly to their prey.
As an all-round athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four are the only cats that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's roar, but more like a sentence full of sharp, elevated words.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals, including monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if possible, since the animals they hunt are far smaller than the ocelot itself.
Scientists think that the ocelot tracks and searches for prey by scent, by smelling the place on earth where it has been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they move very quietly.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return) it will often find itself in an environment different from that in which it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and different rivals, so the new population will have to have different characteristics or adapt to be a stronger rival than was previously required.
The original population has not changed at all, and they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after several thousand or even millions of years, two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the creation of new species.
Plants make oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants use photosynthesis to make their food from the sun, and they also provide us with cool air.
We make our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based.
The mossaurus was the supreme predator of its day, and they feared nothing but other mossaurus.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional set of teeth on a hard shell, meaning that nothing in its path could escape.
We cannot say for sure, but it may have had a tongue with a sharp point, and its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a huge dinosaur like the T. rex would not be able to match it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had some strange or unusual things of their own for a feast, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called the puff.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich preferred to hold banquets where they would lie on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained the foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted porridge.
The Babylonians built a temple to each of their gods, a temple that was considered to be the house of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to please the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard in front of the temple and an inner sanctuary into which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's daily life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open stalls facing the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his findings, the area was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes at that time.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were numerous differences among the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776. The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that somewhere in the beginning of its formation this large document on parchment (29⁄4 inches by 24 1⁄2 inches) was a storage container.
Well, most likely the label was added purely as a marking.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was led by the "Vichy-French", the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had allied themselves with them rather than fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies attacked southern France, the invasion was called Operation Dragonne.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were moving toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people living and working in cooperation, a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas meaning city or city-state, which also defines the size of the community.
Civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, lasting cultural imprint and equitable diffusion.
Smaller cultures usually disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence, and so are often not recognized as true civilizations.
During the war of independence, thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - under the Treaty of Confederation.
Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the state authorities, who were often unwilling to enforce all their legal documents.
Nor did he have any right to overturn the laws of taxation and interstate tariffs.
Unanimous approval from all states was necessary before members could change, and states were so easily swayed by central administration that their representatives were often absent from the sessions.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, wrestling, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international games or Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands it has, Japan is often called an  archipelago on geographical displays.
Taiwan's origins go back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by noticed the island's name as Ilja formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning the transformation of aboriginal grain-producing practices, and employed Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal parts of Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, which granted Japan sovereignty over Taiwan, which it ruled until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photograph format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its width-height ratio has inherited the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide, and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format is considered to be 3:2 (divided by 12 to get the simplest ratio in the form of an integer).
Many common formats (say the APS family of formats) are equal to or close to this size.
The rule of thirds, often abused and often ridiculed, is a simple instruction that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in the picture.
It states that the most striking place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that vertically and horizontally divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, began to be overseen.
For thousands of years, the Christian religion united the nations of Europe, despite differences in language and customs.
With its inexhaustible power, it affected everyone from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds exist for that very reason.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle is being fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, as it cut off the flow of key military and civilian supplies, though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties over the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire stretches of ocean, thus endangering even neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
To accept a job with the Edison Company of New York, Tesla moved to the United States in 1884.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his boss at his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting the different time periods; each period of China or each ruling family represented a distinct dynasty.
There were also periods of divided provinces between each dynasty, the most famous of all being the Three Kingdoms period that lasted sixty years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period there was fierce warfare between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the throne in the vast palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political outcomes such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the state belongs to the people, not to one ruler.
Also after the revolution, occupations were opened up to all men who applied, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military, for instead of being based on class, military ranks are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that were outside of his ordinary life. He often went to meditate in a cave that became known as Hira on Mount Nur (Light).
The cave itself, which has survived through the ages, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is difficult to find, even if one knows it exists.
Nothing is left to be seen but a clear, beautiful sky and the numerous surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of a number of large pyramidal structures that pay homage to the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the Necropolis of Giza in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, consists of several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The Uz arc looks like a V, and the Nizz arc like a spindle or a square with no bottom.
Upper means you should start from the top and push the chute, while Lower means you should start from the fretboard (where your hand holds the chute) and pull the chute.
Raising the whistle usually produces a quieter sound, while lowering it produces a louder and more assertive sound.
Feel free to pen your own markings, but remember that printed chord signs are present for musical reasons and should usually be respected.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (the 11-year-old Maria Theresa and the four-year-old Louis-Charles), as well as the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced on October 6, 1789, to retreat to Paris from Versailles, and to do so were forced by a pack of women from the squat.
They were traveling back to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The ruler ordered the king and queen to open wide the windows of the chariot.
At one point, a member of the royal court waved the head of the royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover most of the expenses and interest on the securities that circulated in the name of the Philippine government in the banks of Wall Street.
Of course, the enormous profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people were the main gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must also understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The era in which these events took place is often called the Late Middle Ages, and it is the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The high medieval period was preceded by the High Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which officially ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by a fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas: that technological development itself proceeds by a path that is beyond cultural and political influences and that in turn technology has its "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it might be said that a motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
Still, a national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Massive car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new healthcare techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a considerable dose of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time customs and cultures would emerge tied to that geography, and these, in accordance with the place of society, were superior to arbitrary imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 and lasted until about 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, largely due to the fact that the crusaders returned, bringing gifts, such as silk and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
Due to the disputed channels of communication, the styles in the west could however be in a backwardness of some 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest inventions of the time as a result of the Crusades was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Consumer agriculture is agriculture conducted to produce enough food for the needs of the farmer and his/her family only.
Consumption farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses preserved seeds, native to a given ecoregion in combination with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers were self-employed, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel left out by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive because of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as unique may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often designate their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at some sad cases of children who, due to neglect, accidents, or physical abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Some feral children have been confined by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of children occurs as a result of parents' refusal to accept the child's serious intellectual and physical disabilities.
The foster children may have experienced severe childhood abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived in the wild themselves.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, feral children display behavior (within physical limits) that almost entirely resembles the behavior of the animals they were raised with, such as their fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, learning through the scale system goes a step further.
Metacognitive support is not a method of learning, but rather a support by which support is provided to individuals, with help going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The tutoring can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is actually a kind of tutor, but also a little human-sleeper in Microsoft Office.
Virtual tutors are an integral part of the software and should review, encourage and explain procedures that might be too complicated for students to perform on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, yet this is what happens.
We view the foster-family system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster-family system should provide a secure home, caring caregivers, continuous education, and reliable health care.
Family placement of children should provide for any supplies that were lacking in homes from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of use and access to content.
For example, learning and socialization are cited as important purposes of Internet use (James et al., 1995).
In studying audience response to web sites, Eimey and Meckurd (1998) identified "personal engagement" and "maintained connections" as new motivational aspects.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that if you interpret microexpressions correctly, you can tell whether a person is lying.
In his work The Chairman's Speech, Oliver Sacks pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even thinks that such abilities in understanding human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two forms of genetic variation: hidden and unseen.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes the variation from the population.
Segregation and recombination affect the constant mixing of variations between the two funds in each generation.
In the savanna, a primate with a human-like digestive tract has difficulty meeting its need for amino acids from the plant sources at its disposal.
Even if this is not done, there can be serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The plant resources most easily accessed were the proteins available in the leaves and the pulses, but primates like us find it difficult to digest them if they are not cooked.
By contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, egg) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not surprise us if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savanna.
A sleep break is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly afterward (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be explained by a relatively quiet alarm clock that would bring you to a conscious state without fully waking you.
If you reset the clock while you sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, the famous diuretic) before bedtime, which causes a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in that person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force.
The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own negativity and tension.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but these have been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightened energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity of Yoga, and through visualization of the various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and an enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the conflicts of systems, processes and cultures led to the two countries becoming divided.
Two years after the war ended, former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was planned to last 40 years, and the fight would be direct, through conflicts of smaller countries representing the interests of larger military powers, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was a withdrawal and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Trans-oceanic shipping is arguably the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and large amounts of goods across oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while also preventing the enemy from transporting their own people and goods.
One of the most famous recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to smuggle men and arms across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easier access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other pasturage, often accompanied by goats that were mostly children or young, similar to more familiar herdsmen.
Wagon tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although early railroads consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to achieve greater speeds and to pull greater loads than on the slightly more uneven roads of the time.
Railroad sleepers were introduced early enough to hold rails in place, but it was gradually realized that rails would be more efficient if they had a nail bar on top.
This became an established practice, but the iron caused more damage to the car's wooden wheels.
In time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first full-iron tires were used.
The first known form of transport was walking. Humans began walking upright 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as is customary.
The improvement in bipedalism was found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more environmentally friendly lives, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to some extent to reduce future suffering.
In many cases, this is symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and put it out.
Clearly, the world has changed a great deal as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have been made greater by mankind's overpopulation and extravagant way of life.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away, to John Dunlap's printing press.
During the night, between 150 and 200 specimens were produced, now known as "Danlap's pages".
Johnson first read the document in public on July 8 in the courtyard of the Independence Hall.
A copy was sent to George Washington on 6 July, read to his troops on 9 July in New York, and a copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Danlapp inscriptions still known to exist are the oldest extant copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with claws and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on handwritten information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits in computer jargon.
Symptoms, such as vomiting, are common enough that they cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open package of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Look at the label for the specific first-aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term beetle in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term derives from an ancient familiarity with the cockroach, an insect well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both killer and common cockroaches are long-term parental species, adapted to life in the host's cage or home.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged persons.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS symptoms as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples may decide to plan to adopt a baby.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that the other couple can be the child's parent.
The main task of science is to understand the way the world works using the scientific method. This method actually governs most scientific research.
Experimentation is not the only test, however, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were respected.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic biological rhythms that are not simply responses to periodic shifts in external influences have been observed in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to have a period of free-running rotation, even if there are no external signs.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading indicators that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments that labeled phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or protein phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are reproductive cells.
Only mutations in the bacilli can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including the flora and fauna of the wild.
Field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem data.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural areas by car to go to their workplaces, interacting with those whose workplace is located right where they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation process, all are somehow connected and support a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this high-carbon economy has dragged the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems.
Similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are seldom heard in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints and make daily mistakes? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more serious going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic jams is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave within a reasonable range of consistency; thus traffic flows have some reasonable consistency and can be represented by rough mathematics.
To better represent traffic flow, three main characteristics are established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of the facilities on the road.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings close to their body.
This gives them a greater choice of various small places to hide from predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings are the finches and water lilies.
Thousands of years earlier, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people believed that he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
This sounds reasonable, since the earth does not feel as if it were moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with its mestimic width of six miles.
A whopping twenty percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing surpassed the pyramids at Giza in their size and technical excellence of construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which by then were over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least populous country.
The Vatican uses Italian in its laws and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican citizens are Roman Catholics.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, copper have been known to man since ancient times, since they can be found in nature in their original form and can be extracted relatively easily with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, plasma, although he also theorized that they converted into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is actually a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, and there are, of course, metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that consist of small amounts of nonmetals such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that billions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Sadly, when new writing methods appeared, the pen was relegated to a lower status and used less.
People now write messages on a computer screen without ever having been near a cutter.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will become when it encounters something new.
The physics bomb works by taking energy to build a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It is like pushing heavy chariots along a hill, and then splitting the core releases a certain amount of energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to decay with little or no stimulation.
The moon's surface is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km (43 mi) thick on the near side and 100 km (62 mi) thick on the far side.
It is thin beneath the lunar sea, and thick beneath the hills.
The lower the crust, the more likely there are lunar seas on the near side, making it easier for the lava to come to the surface.
Content theories are geared towards finding out what motivates people or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalized as they matured into adults.
These theories study what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they do, and what things in their environment will cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Malle's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two forms of behavior can occur when managers start leading their former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or "one of the girls").
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary action, assessing performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he must change everything that the team has done and make it his own.
Ultimately, it is the leader who is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Such behavior often results in a gap between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams should meet the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones that local leadership would not have an understanding of.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
An invisible team is a management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals for applying the concept of organizational learning in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can come to the fore.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome obstacles can lead to a new innovative process that will meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Ejnel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of productivity.
Neurobiology data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive ability research, which in itself narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports the claims of scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of data and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI draws a strong connotation towards science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and client questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military purposes, as it is embedded in several home computers and video game software applications.
Flight is a big part of every classroom, and often the teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers solutions in the form of virtual trips, where students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting in their class.
Virtual sharing of outing experiences is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future graduates.
For example, each year, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a web page about their trip to the state capital, each year the web page is re-designed, but older versions are kept online so that they can serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve writing in students. Although students often begin their blogging experience with cluttered grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to try to fix the writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "encourages students to become more creative about the world around them". The need to stimulate audience interest inspires students to be smart and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to materials from the Internet, students can define their views in the context of other texts, as well as express their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravets, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and it has a host of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, while the north is a haven of pristine natural beauty of Musco and beyond.
All of this further highlights Ontario as something that foreigners consider to be essentially Canadian.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated, and some are almost completely uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest island, and a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the mainland, and it was largely accepted on the Comoros and on Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Wives: All passengers are recommended to say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (not just one that seems too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to something they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, hand-grabbed, and so forth.
Be firm in your rejection of men and do not be afraid to take a stand (cultural differences or not, it is not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and even the Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Dar el-Badi, and the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there gave it the name of Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagis, pottery, leather galantries, nargile and a whole range of dranguli, but all of these are aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
Goma was destroyed in 2002 by the volcanic lava of the Nyiragongo, which flooded most of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is fairly safe, any visits outside Goma should be well researched to understand the state of the fighting that continues in North Kivu province.
This city is also the base from which the ascent of the Nihiragongo volcano is made, along with some of the cheapest tracking of mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle-style taxi) to get around Gomé. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a shorter ride.
Because of its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu is used as a metaphor for exotic, remote lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, though its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, Timbuktu was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger.
It was one of Henry Louis Gates' main stops during the filming of "The Wonder of the African World", on PBS.
This city is in sharp contrast to other cities in the country, as it has more Arab than African flavor.
Kruger National Park (NPK) is located northeast of South Africa and along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which contains a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the main attraction of South Africa's National Parks (JANPark).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily fees for conservation and park admission.
Consider buying a wild card, which allows entry into certain South African parks or all national parks of the Republic of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The row of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is likened to a shiny banded graph that becomes apparent with the presence of Victoria Harbour water.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon Bay on the opposite side.
Most of the urban part of Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This place was taken over by British colonists, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest inshore mangrove belt in the world, and extends 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the backwaters of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining powerful jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans extends over an area of 3850 km2, of which one-third is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 elk in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-city bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and Jakarta/Bumintang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because inter-city buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punak (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-del-Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 271 feet (83 m), and the bridge is 1,298 feet (378 m) long and has two spans of 12 feet (3.5 m) wide.
The vertical opening under the bridge is 15 metres in size.[citation needed] Construction was completed in August 2011 but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully put into use in September 2017, when the completion of customs clearance on the Brazilian side is expected.
The Huron were the most important indigenous group inhabiting present-day eastern Paraguay, and lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in self-sustaining agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycuaro and the Pajaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the "Diva Province of India", was founded in the 16th century as a result of encounters between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three-century period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo grounds in Las Canitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For all tournament news and information on where to buy polo tickets, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official Falklands currency is the Falklands Pound (FRF) whose value is set equivalent to the value of one British Pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across the street from the FIC West store.
British pounds will mostly be accepted anywhere on the islands and within Stanley credit cards, and US dollars are also often accepted.
In remote islands credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British currency and United States currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine which payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside the island, so exchange money before leaving the island.
Since Montevidéu is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate; in the summer months, temperatures over 30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely go below zero, but the wind and humidity combined give a feeling that is much colder than the thermometer says.
There are no distinct wet and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, the wild is still wild, and they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authority, keep at least 100 yards [100 yards] away from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 yards] away from all other wildlife!
Despite their appearance, bison, North American and European moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep their distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food that smells strong, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s, and has officially held the title of capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval skirmish in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, with nearly two hundred American and German lives lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the assassination of the Tupua chief Tamasees Lealophia III.
Since Auckland is spread over two harbours, there are many beaches, the most popular being those in three areas:
The Northern Beaches (in the North Shore area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devenport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy with safe swimming areas, and most of them are cold, making the trees shake.
Tamaki Drive Beach is in the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a rich array of shops lining the shore.
The main local beer Broj jedan is not a complex beer, but is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines that are good to try, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better suited for the journey.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.
For Australians, coffee is a white double espresso with milk, while black is an espresso, cappuccino comes with a highly spiced straw (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, and the water-juices are expensive but delicious.
Numerous tours of the cliff are organized throughout the year, and injuries resulting from any of the above causes are rare.
Still, accept the advice of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Quaternary jellyfish appear near the beach and near the river mouth from October to April north of the city, 1770.
Most sharks are afraid of people and will swim as far away from you as possible.
Sea crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their primary habitat being the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking a reservation in advance assures the traveler that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through them.
Travel agents usually offer arrangements that include breakfast, airport transportation, or even a combination of a flight and a hotel.
They can also save your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or can obtain other documents you need for the destination you are visiting (e.g. visa).
Any supplement or request should first be sent to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on the spot, and most visitors consider this a significant part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will have to arrive early to secure a camping spot near the music.
Remember that while the music may have stopped on the main stages, there may be parts of the festival where music plays late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic during winter, check the location of the hut, since the passage through the ice causes quite awful sounds for those most affected.
Cruise to St. Petersburg includes time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually put a lot of effort into maximizing the time and money spent by visitors.
They usually have special offerings of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and to keep them in the building.
Some places serve alcohol on a charge, but drunkenness affects judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of remaining sober.
Anyone planning a high-altitude drive or a mountain crossing should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, signage is poor and you cannot drive as if on asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow may fall to cause a snowstorm in a very short time.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or flying snow, as well as fog or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic runs mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
The safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the pinnacle of the experience for many visitors.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to overland journeys where you can see stunning African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars more slowly, so standard equipment provides good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you will better see them with your eyes wide open.
Walking safaris (also called walking nature safaris, walking safaris, or walking tours) consist of hiking, which lasts a couple of hours or a couple of days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodations before the delay was announced, you may find yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus cancellation policies do not apply until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
The expected price of most event tickets will range from 2,500 to 130,000 Japanese yen, with a typical ticket price being around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels offer the rental of ashtrays and ashtrays, even if you do not have them in your room.
If you do not have access to an ashtray, or if you do not like to wear a pair of ashtrays, you may try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful that the fabric does not become too warm (which can lead to shrinkage or, in extreme cases, frostbite).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective than certain methods.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from reputable companies.
Travelers may encounter pests that are unfamiliar to them in their native regions.
Harmful germs can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
The very infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill a person are not usually turned into pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties at certain locations.
Travelers who go to high-tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont provides the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, as it often passes through isolated rural areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be prepared to react quickly: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are the prevailing road.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on previous and later races  usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and their strict observance is even more important than otherwise.
Interestingly, however, the cell phone network is much stronger here than along many other sections of the road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German pastries are quite good, and Bavarian ones are quite rich and varied, much like those from its southern neighbor, Austria.
Night baking is common, with apples baked throughout the year, while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often go especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich biscuits, try what is called berliner, fankühen, or kraffen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices in combination with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be either dry or moist, depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a general term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines throughout the country.
But when used without additional qualifiers, the term usually denotes food originating from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine contains a rich array of simply seasoned dishes, among which are the predominant flavours that Javanese prefer such as peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The nails are the supports for the rider's feet that hang from either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, but can pose a safety problem due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his foot gets caught in a noose, he may be pulled out if the horse continues to run.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots, with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow heel.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety barriers that allow the skin of the saddle to fall off if pulled by the rider at the moment of fall.
The Cochamo Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its numerous large granite walls and cliffs.
From the highest peaks, breathtaking vistas are provided. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes between the unseen potentials of the mountainside.
Snow-mounted sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving descending down a snow-covered terrain on a ski or snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main activity during the trip, and many enthusiasts, often known as "skiers", plan entire vacations spent skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is extremely old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 B.C.E.!
Alpine skiing as a sport has existed since at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is often called skiing in the countryside, ski touring or ski walking.
It is related to, but does not usually involve, ski touring or alpine-style mountaineering; the latter is performed on steep terrain and requires much tighter skis and boots.
Think of a skiing route as a similar to a hiking route.
In good conditions you will be able to cover a little more than walking  but very rarely will you reach the speed of Nordic skiing without a heavy bag on the paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean going through visa and passport controls more times.
In this respect, however, the Schengen Area functions much like a single state.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can generally cross the border without having to pass through passport control posts again.
Similarly, once you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for visas for each Schengen member state separately, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what makes a manufactured item an antique, and some tax agencies define items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographic variations, where the age limit could be shorter in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handmade items can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than some similar mass-produced items.
The cultivation of the irva is important to the life of the Lapons, and the culture of trade is also important to many who are engaged in other professions.
However, even traditionally, not all Sami were heavily devoted to irvas farming, but lived from fishing, hunting and similar activities, and the irvas were mainly used for pulling and carrying loads.
Today, many Lapons are involved in modern crafts, and tourism is a major source of income in Laponia, a region in the Laponian region.
Although common, especially outside the Roma community, the word tziganin is often considered offensive because it arouses negative stereotypes and wrong conclusions about the Roma.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to travel recommendations, it may affect your health insurance or your insurance coverage in case of a cancellation.
You may also want to listen to the advice of other governments, but their advice is for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different scenarios than Europeans or Arabs.
The reports are merely brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and simplified in relation to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is a generic term for any weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or result in loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are the forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal hazardous weather events include thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks of bad weather in the area where they are, as it may affect their travel plans.
Anyone who wants to travel to a country that might be called a war zone would have to undergo professional training beforehand.
If you type "hostile environment course" into a search engine, you will likely be directed to a local business.
The course will usually cover in much more detail all the issues discussed here, mostly with practical experience.
The course will usually last 2 to 5 days and involve role-playing, lots of first aid, and sometimes training in weapons handling.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad must check that they have valid repatriation documents with them.
The willingness of governments to issue passports that do not state who the person is of gender (X) or documents that have been updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to comply with these documents varies equally.
Security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Proper transgender persons should not expect to be allowed to pass through the scans with untouched privacy and dignity.
The cut-off currents represent the return current from waves that break off from the beach, often present on a reef or similar places.
Because of the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated at a few deeper sections and there can be a fast current to the deep water.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue while attempting to swim uphill, which can be fatal.
Once you get out of the current, swimming backwards is no more difficult than it is otherwise.
Try to aim somewhere where you will not be caught again or, depending on your skills and whether you are spotted, you may wish to wait to be rescued.
Repatriation shock occurs earlier than culture shock (the shorter the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had an easy time adjusting to a new culture may find it especially difficult to adjust to their native culture again.
On returning home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and have lost some of your native culture habits.
When you first went to a foreign country, people were probably patient and understanding with you, knowing that travelers in a new country must adjust.
People may not expect that the travelers returning home also need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show in the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children to do here.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in the silence before the show starts.
Usually, the sound of tourists and vendors is always heard.
The sphinx is set as the background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids, and various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, is home to many nations and has the largest number of bases, sixteen of which were active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest island being King George Island, inhabited by Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshut sea.
Here the peninsula mountains merge into the plateau, and then re-emerge to form the 360 km chain of Ellsworth Mountain, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range is the highest mountain in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak Vinson reaching 4892 m (16,073 ft).
In remote areas where there is no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a cell phone, since to make a call, you must be out in the open and have your satellite in clear view.
This service is often used for cruise travel, including yachts, as well as for expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a year off is to travel and study.
This is especially popular with high school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before college without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during a year of study break may improve prospects for advancing toward higher education in one's home country.
There is usually a fee to enroll in some of these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for sailing. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes, and in offshore archipelagos.
You do not need a yacht in the archipelago and lakes.
While the nearby archipelago and the largest lake are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is the case in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise very unique (e.g., in the Netherlands the number is from one to forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruises have extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of days and return to sleep on the ship for the night.
If you go to the coast only as part of boat trips, you do not need a special visa (as of 2009).
As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not even close to the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all backgrounds and age groups, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and insecurities about other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can help them to overcome fear based on the unknown or the inability to control events.
Curial companies are well paid for fast delivery of things. Time is often very important when dealing with business documents, goods, or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for some other routes or smaller firms it was a problem.
If they sent goods by air freight, it may have taken days on some routes to get through customs and customs.
The only way to get through faster was to send the baggage as checked in. Airline regulations would not allow them to send the baggage without a passenger, where you enter the story.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to set aside a large sum of money for that privilege (or, better yet, to get the company you work for to do it for you).
This is not cheap, however: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the usual economy ticket for business, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point even in asking for discounts for business seats and first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there are certain groups of passengers who are willing to pay extra for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
This conflict in 1994 resulted in the creation of a self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member.
Economic ties were re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, as well as a very good transport hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna is now a modern, developed and bustling commercial center located in a large bay surrounded by mountains.
Broad boulevards, glass-walled buildings, and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century marketplace, and old mosques and churches, though the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than a traditional Turkish one.
The village of Hallodarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the portico of the church, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above some tombs.
It is worth spending half an hour walking through the intriguing village.
To the north and in close proximity is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron noted the splendid tale of its wonders.
The Scooterbus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place known worldwide by the indications of the Virgin Mary.
Please note that you are visiting a place of mass graves, as well as a place of almost inestimable significance to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived their stay here, and many more whose loved ones were killed or maimed to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this place with the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves, and do not make fun of the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not destroy the space by making markings or by cutting graffiti on objects.
The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, since it is established by law as the first official language.
Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are in Catalan only, but unplanned stops are automatically posted in a large number of languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, unkind, and arrogant.
While this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is to behave nicely - like someone who is bien élevé (well-behaved).
The rude behavior of Parisians quickly evaporates if you show a little basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, pine and fir trees, and contains a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has an extremely wide range of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, differing soils, and varying elevations.
The area is also home to an extremely large number of different species of animals and birds.
Rare animal species, including brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wildcats, and great apes, as well as many more common species, can be found here
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts below the knees, as well as covering their shoulders.
Most monasteries have a dress provided for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own dress, especially one with bright colors, you will evoke a smile on the face of the monk or nun at the entrance.
By the same rule, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
And you can borrow this from the supply at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each wear, so you may not feel comfortable wearing this dress.
Majorcan cuisine, like those of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in its entirety.
A simple popular dinner, especially during the summer, is pa amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and any available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word Sie, which means the word Vi, are always written with a capital initial, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be said to facilitate reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or a preposition is used in the form of a pronoun.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are spelled.
The basic letters to look out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies with the accompanying consonant.
Also, try to pronounce r and r differently: car means dear, while carro means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and generally regular grammar.
Thus, reading this grammar book would help you to learn much about Persian grammar and to understand phrases better.
Needless to say, if you speak some Romanian, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it does not need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are largely obsolete today, existing as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not as problematic in their heyday as it is today, they can usually be found in cities or on campuses, where they were more readily available than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes are huge structures in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of the cherry blossom, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebration was organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in their natural environment, so take up the challenge of removing at least one specimen.
If you are visiting a formal garden, by collecting the usuraka you will also be expelled, and without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit and is very easy to navigate through, and you can buy almost anything on arrival.
But since it is located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both warm (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, whichever is less).
A couple of buses also travel north to Hebron, where the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives is located.
Check that the bus you plan to take does not only go to the nearby Jewish neighborhood of Kiryat Arba but also to Hebron itself.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for planning a vacation.
For example, visiting the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or cruising to sights on the Danube or taking a boat trip along the Irie Canal.
They also define routes for popular walking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by non-Christians in Christendom and by non-Christians worldwide.
There is a tradition of spending the night of the resurrection without sleeping, in an open place to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is quite possible that this spring and fertility ritual predates Christianity.
More traditional churches often hold a Easter vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend, while communities often go out with a celebration as soon as midnight strikes to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or floating.
The great distance from the continent prevented mammals from traveling, making the giant tortoise the primary animal grazing the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man on the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions during winter, you will experience polar nights, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, since the sky will be dimmer and dimmer throughout the day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem, and you can enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is hierarchical and more formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Suits are business attire, and coworkers call each other by nickname or title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group effort rather than individual accomplishments.
Often, employees must seek the approval of their superiors for every decision they make, and they are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
