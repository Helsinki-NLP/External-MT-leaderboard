India is also reportedly hoping for a defence cooperation treaty between the two nations.
Police arrested by Karratha 20 year olds after fast motorcycle hunt
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver had driven it at 125 km / h in a 70 km / h zone and through scrubland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried this morning to stop a blue motorcycle after they had observed it, as it left a gas station on the Bathdate Road at 125 km / h.
The police reported that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued driving on Burgess Road before he bowed into the bushland where the officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle and a person who corresponded to the driver's description were later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The police of Karratha accused a 20-year-old man of non-observance of a holding signal and reckless driving.
He is scheduled to appear in Karratha on 23 September in front of the District Court.
The bike was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is in court for rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read out at a hearing by the Glasgow Supreme Court.
He is accused of having raped a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "unconscious, slept, and could not signal consent."
Webster is also accused of raped a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highlands on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae started the hearing on 17 November at the Edinburgh Supreme Court.
Recalling the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a legislative proposal to establish the organization of trade unions as civil rights.
“As trade unions die, middle-class jobs also die, ” said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
I am therefore proud to present the Employee Authorisation Act together with the Civil Rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities in terms of discrimination on grounds of the organization of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-union forces.
Supplementing the National Labour Law to create a possibility for workers exposed to discrimination to organize a union representation in order to bring justice before a civil court - and to obtain damages or fines - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other sponsors of their bill propose is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that trade unions have faced in recent years – in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other countries across the country – Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand, and respect labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarised autocracy of Hedki Tojo would be replaced by democracy.
Conscious that the workers and their trade unions played a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "workers' rights to unification and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler ’ s fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans added a clause explicitly stating: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve labour and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements that restrict this right or aim to reduce it are null and void; targeted measures are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join unions to protect their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans said that the right to establish a union - and that this union should then participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - must be protected.
Indeed, since these rights are under attack in America, it is very wise to reconsider the American ideal, according to which the working population must have the right to unite and to make itself heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers ’ movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but enlarged it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and we should do so.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and redeemed the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A US federal judge temporarily stopped implementing a law in Louisiana on Sunday, which lawyers say would probably have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, which was brought into force by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and is due to enter into force on Sept. 1, would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a patient admission right at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to practice.
However, the judge ’ s decision means that doctors can continue to legally carry out abortions while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law as they strive to obtain these rights," wrote Federal Judge John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing is scheduled for the judge to bring about a more lasting decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision to take the most recent in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors would gain so more time to obtain hospitalization rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana escape a sneaky law that wants to take their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Center for Reproduction Rights, which had sued on behalf of three of the five clinics of the state to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the verdict also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the lawsuit and also applied for instructions.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, with courts recently declared such measures to be unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key points of a law in Texas that would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that instruction rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors.
Abortion opponents object to the fact that the measures serve to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the impact of closure of clinics.
Only a physician who carries out abortions in Louisiana has patients' insights, the Center for Reproduction Rights announced.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop abortion, this doctor would no longer perform the operation for fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the ruling, Louisiana officials said that they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions, while their requests for patient information would still be pending.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment opportunities lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video video footage for her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are more likely to die from ovarian cancer than women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, mortality risk was 20% higher during the study than for those living in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New medicines could slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers investigated the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-diseases and social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer had already progressed further at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was lowest.
For those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, mortality risk was 20% higher during the study than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to have died of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services in order to counteract the distances, it proposed, as a possible remedy, to strengthen the service of incoming doctors in order to give specialists the opportunity to provide women more densely at their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical status, the study showed a poor long-term survival rate for women in ovarian cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young 33 year old mother of the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret declining house owners
The decline, together with an increased decline in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age, could cause garden centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds per year if today ’ s young consumers reach the “nuclear age group for garden products ” according to a HTA study, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report says that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people with homes spend on their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of asphalting front gardens for parking, and the decreasing garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, where estimated £5 billion a year is being implemented on sale.
In Greater London, where the share of home owners has fallen from 61% to 43% over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that living for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot draw plants.
Guy Barter, chief horticultural consultant for the RHS, said: "Containers are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them when moving."
The HTA ’ s report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the “golden age ” of garden retail due to rising house ownership numbers and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation this year because of the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan led by opposition politician Imran Khan and the clergy Tahirul Qadri continues.
In the capital Islamabad, around 1000 demonstrators stormed the state television channel PTV.
Information minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV ’ s buildings again.
The transmitter stopped its operation for about 40 minutes, but now sends again.
At the same time, around 3000 demonstrators tried to get to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Approximately one kilometer from it they supplied themselves with poles and stones equipped collisions with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators called for Sharif ’ s resignation, but he rejects it.
Meanwhile, the country ’ s army urges a political solution to the conflict “without wasting time and without using violence. ”
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been brushing more frequently.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of having cheated on the parliamentary election last May.
The protests escalated on the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to invade Sharif ’ s residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey appoints US diplomat for espionage report
The Turkish State Department has appointed the country ’ s oldest US diplomats to report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the US Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that those by the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a major activity area for the US and British secret services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all major countries were spying on each other.
A previous report that also targeted Germany ’ s most important secret service, Ankara, caused much more annoying responses from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: drivers threaten with consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike of train drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The distance announced for 18 to 21 o'clock concerned nationwide all transport companies, also the long-distance, regional and S-Bahn,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.
Photo: A. Burgi / Archive
said the district chairman of the union Deutscher Lokomotivführer in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike was freight traffic.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to minimise the impact.
However, the authorities did not say where they wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms.
Chief of Police of Magaluf accused of corruption
The prosecutors presented on Friday to the office of the Prosecutor of Mallorca evidence of blackmail by police and employees of the city of Calvià.
The head of the Calvià police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested on charges of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous Binge and Drinking Hotspot Magaluf.
Commissioners José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after charges of corruption against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and night clubs are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police and employees of the city of Calvià to the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Attorney ’ s Office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption charges and are interviewed by a judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish national daily ABC reported that the angry night club owners said that the cronyism of the authorities had a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Let our livelihood out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing on 24 men during a Sauftour Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the irregular behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the infamous alcoholic drinks tavern tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour Organizer Carnage together have to pay a penalty of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is particularly popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for a number of alcoholic accidents, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The BREAKFAST gave South Australia a winter surprise, with heavy showers and strong wind that affected flights from Adelaide airport.
In the evening until 21 o'clock another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen on the night to Sunday.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a cast that began shortly before 20: 00 and caused almost 4mm precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After the winter caused an early dose of spring last week, the temperatures in the city fell to a maximum value of only 15.8 ° on Monday.
The bad weather conditions have probably led to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a shearing wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to go through.
Wind blows reached around 50 km / h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the plane had to start on a second landing and finally set up at about 20.40 o'clock.
The delay led to the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16 ° C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies means: Highest time for big networking
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech control panels, our columnist Bernd Matthies comforts himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this here, my gaze falls on the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there is one consideration behind it: if the cable weren ’ t, all listeners would fly around in the house in no time, and that would be much more retro.
Anyway, on the eceltronic (eceltronic?
No, typo: electronic) sector the rule that the world novelty of today is the electric scrap of tomorrow, bought - obsolete.
And who, for example, still has a tubular TV in the living room today, says that he basically rejects television.
Why these considerations?
Because the push of the Ifa at the radio tower this week again shows us our absolute incompetence in questions of electronics.
The layman, who used to control the washing machine and CD player blindly, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread out in front of him with an incomprehensible vain expert speech: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" the press office promises us.
Yes, is it still possible?
What should we talk about with people who apparently volunteer to spread such a quark?
Basically, for some 20 years, it has been a question of linking our house with pleasure.
So that the yogurt itself reorders, so that the fire detector informs us on vacation on the Maldives that it burns in the study degree.
And wouldn ’ t it be wonderful if we had air conditioning from the office for our early arrival...?
Yes, but this requires an air conditioning system.
But a dream will come true soon: We lift our wristwatch, tell her loudly "suck!" - and at home the vacuum robot starts.
Misguided.
Everything runs out on nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown merchandise blur", raunt an industry connoisseur, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steam oven sends the weather report and the data glasses indicates how long the pizza still needs in the oven, which does not help, because we stand in a traffic jam.
We also know from the daily practice that when a neumodic device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air-raid shelters, while rocket and mortar attacks on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and schools in Gaza remained closed while the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of school brought a feeling of joy and expectation to the communities in the south of Israel, marked by rocket launchers, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, hit by a rocket, removed grenade fragments from the walls and sliding walls before the pupils arrived.
"We are a bit afraid, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11 year old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a bit funny" to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't go out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire interrupted the war last week, thousands of inhabitants of border communities such as Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza and escape the rocket and mortar fire in safer areas.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the Gaza border, where a four-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are still reluctant to return.
The Ministry of Education said that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Her children were temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border city in Gaza, which is heavily affected by Palestinian fire.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that you acquire knowledge and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting, but important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas' call for the lifting of the Israeli Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for Hamas to be disarmed and for the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting to be handed over.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt later this month.
The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of those killed are combatants, but did not provide concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells in Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area, and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and struggle, last week the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year.
"I hope that the school will soon be reopened so that we can continue to learn, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13 year old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza.
After election in Saxony: CDU ’ s leader Strobl calls into question prohibition proceedings
In view of the loss of votes in Saxony, the CDU Federal Vice-President Thomas Strobl has declared himself in favour of an end to the current Federal Constitutional Court ’ s prohibition proceedings.
Berlin - According to CDU's vice-president Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the Federal Constitutional Court should be brought to an end.
Strobl, who is also CDU's head of state in Baden Wuerttemberg, said that "the Leipziger Volkszeitung" cuts off worse than last time.
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that gives me more of the result of the fight against the Conservative Party politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
In the vote on Sunday, the Left Party had failed very close to the five percent hurdle.
A first attempt for a prohibition of the far-right party had failed in 2003, because at that time the premier also had informants in the offensive.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after long preparation.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
Refugees are now accommodated in tents at Neuländer Platz.
The central initial reception for refugees in Harburg bursts from all seams.
Now the internal authority has placed three Red Cross tents next to it.
The district politicians were only informed shortly before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck ’ s actions continue to fuel citizens ’ reservations and do not give district politicians the opportunity to play a constructive role in the humane housing of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group Chairman of the Greens at the Harburg District Assembly.
Your party demands that the Harburg district administration provide currently unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the first photo are the onslaught of those seeking help - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, shows a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP ’ s data of Monday.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase is 4.2 percent in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9%, more than twice the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not equally distributed across the country.
RP Data research leader Tim Lawless announced that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-division market.
The figures from RP Data show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices rose by only 1.4% over the year.
Mr Lawless said that with the beginning of spring, there would now be an increase in real estate for sale over the next few months, which would be "a real test" for the market.
"If you look at the constantly high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the constantly low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will increase even further in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New Press he contradicts statements of the managing director Peer Medau and attests to this to pose "like a commander".
This is not the style of the university, according to the communication.
In mid-June, the Medau family had already been informed orally about the university's request.
The statement that the plans were only announced in July is definitely wrong, "says Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "pre-determined or even decisions", but there are "preferences".
The expansion of the narrow road up to the castle, which is necessary for access, is less dramatic than the Medaus feared.
There was and is not talk of a nine meter wide road.
According to the current state of play, it is about 5.50 metres, which is one metre wider than before, "explains Pötzl.
Pötzl does not want to accept the argument of the medallists that their free and school parking spaces will then only be used by university students in the future.
It is not parked at all, because this can be solved intelligently as with other public parking spaces.
Thinking of the residents
According to the university president, the Kinderkrippe Bergwichtel, which is located on the premises and at whose front door the access to the parking deck would lead, is to be "not affected".
Instead, he points out, "that this is not only about the nursery, but also about the residents at the mouth of Frederick Streib and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring secondary school.
It is therefore about much more than about particular interests of Messrs Medau ", says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parents' advisory board of the crèche, with the expansion of the street would be justified "one of the few natural spots of Coburg be lost", "the reader himself can decide".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the State Building Office Bamberg, intends to inform the city councillors about the structural development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau had last week informed the parents of the crèche about the plans of the university.
Accordingly, the driveway for the new parking deck is not supposed to take you over the campus and Frederick Streib Street, but over the Medau Hill.
This would mean that the narrow road would have to be extended two-lane on a length of about one kilometre.
According to the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would increase tenfold.
There is talk of around 2000 vehicles a day.
The city did not want to comment on the project.
Glandorf resigns from Handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from SG Flensburg, Handewitt, cited health problems for this decision.
I did not like the decision easily, it has matured for several months.
It ’ s time for me to listen to my body ’ s signals and end my career in the national team, ” said the 2007 World Champion on his Facebook page.
He is thus retiring internationally with a balance sheet of 167 international matches and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the throwing powerful back space player wants to go for a few years for the Champions League champion from Flensburg, he is no longer at the disposal of the new leader Dagur Sigurdsson.
Glandorf had a "long and good conversation" with the Icelandic, who announced his squad for the international games against Switzerland on Tuesday.
His ideas and approaches inspired me just as much as they will inspire my long-standing fellow players and my successors.
But for my club, I would like to be available in a healthy way in the next few years, for which longer regeneration breaks are necessary, which do not allow the current double load.
After a heel infection, the left-handed had even had to fear his end of his career in 2012.
Because of Achillessehnenproblemen he had himself treated by team physicians of the German handball federation (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which had triggered a strong inflammation later.
An emergency operation and two further interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team careers do not pass by any body without trace.
I have some health sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot operations, which took place at short intervals in 2012, I never really got a grip on my blood pressure.
This is accompanied by some other wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year I noticed that I control my head, but cannot deceive my body ", explained Glandorf in the interview to the magazine" Handball Time ".
He would only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"When all ropes tear, I am always ready to talk," the two-time father of the family told the magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I must also say that after my long stay in the hospital in 2012, I have also become quite humble as far as my health is concerned.
After my career I want to be able to go at least to some extent straight.
In addition to the World Cup title in 2007 and winning the Champions League in 2014, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012 he also secured with Flensburg the European Cup winner.
German economy shrunk by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the globe have slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared with the previous quarter.
The Federal Statistical Office reported this and thus confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
External trade also slowed the economy.
Thanks to the strong start of the year, a total GDP increase of 0.8 percent for the first half of the year compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of the "Münsterland -Mooiste", which led through the Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzenfahrer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling federation of the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlands-Mooiste".
It is the biggest cycling tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organising this tour through Münsterland with their registration.
This tour was offered to interested visitors in various trade journals.
We come from Den Helder and drove overnight to take part in this tour.
We would also like to get to know the Münsterland in this way ", the cyclists were happy about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the club house of the Schützenfraternity Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace journey" through the city over the wall, where also the start took place.
The route, which was advertised for three different categories, continued towards Herrenholz via Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On trails of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were cared for on the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Main organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayor Heinz Lölfing were very pleased about the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for everyone involved.
The organization ran without problems and there were no negative incidents ", Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately not as many participants came as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see each other again in 2015 with hopefully nice weather on August 30th or during another weekend", but the cyclists promised to come back to Münsterland and the organizers plan a new edition.
Konstantin Weckers relentlessly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, politsicher activist, ex detainee, in "Mönch und Krieger" on 287 pages on paper brought.
The Munich born on June 1, 1947 has written down his memoirs, not chronologically, but more thought-traps for thought-traps, each chapter initiated by a suitable song text.
And he is relentlessly honest: from onanie as a grammar school to shoplifting and drug use, he does not leave out any human weakness.
Also to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Broad space also includes abstract but even more important concepts: love, soul, ego, being in the present, spirituality - all of which he tries to get to the bottom, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how he was influenced not only by music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also by his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who is "created by subtraction", as he says, "by omitting all unnecessary things".
But there are also short anecdotes to the earth between all the highly spiritual views: for example, over thugs in a restaurant frequented by GIs or an insane car ride, where he frontal aimed at a tree.
Again, he is relentlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me into my arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and originated from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
One never saw his face, only heard his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Get away!
I want to look at cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket strike.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life he was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, he gained an insight into how life might have been for him.
It is now a little brighter, but they are dark, smoky, deep stylish labyrinths with flames and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father used to simply lay down in the tub and then one could hear him slowly as he began to sing because he could wash the foundry from himself.
When I ran around there, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him became greater.
However, Henry grew up as a child without his parents' convictions of love.
My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you".
Only when my mother went badly towards the end of her life did we begin to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you".
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop with the "I love you"?
Stop embracing me!
Daddy, I am 22!
with Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
It is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I pulled out this fitness and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is exhausting.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry ’ s career shift may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he has been captured by the theater.
It followed The Comedy of Errors, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have completed his busy working life.
He began working in a factory at the age of 16.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated persons and wrote about him on New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-seventies. "I was the only black imitator / comedian on television for quite a long time."
He learned in his profession.
Not only did I have to become big before the eyes of the public, but also from 1975 to 1985 I had to learn how to become an efficient jokes and narration machine, while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
As his manager had the right to stage at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted black", Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very unpleasant.
I wish it never happened, but I don't regret that I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked with huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "years of award-winning light column of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
Through the introduction of characters who both mocked and celebrated the British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the eighties.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show was broadcast in 1984, and in the nineties he was known among other things as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles coined his next decade, but after his BBC season series LennyHenry.tv in 2008 he thought: "What are you doing next, Len, because it feels as if you're just taking the time around or stepping a little on the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and mostly considered him a domain of the middle class, whites in tights and a cabbage in the front.
So I was very afraid of it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't do it badly if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few words into your mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello ’ s last speech for the documentary and he was enthusiastic.
I had the feeling that I could do that.
It was almost as if someone finally put my head right.
"That's what it's all about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a bit.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that simply did not happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed". "
There was a technical mistake and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A small voice told me," You now have to bridge for 10 minutes while they repair the computer. "
Instead, the stage director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said "Oh, thank God".
I am not responsible for that.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the tendons.
This too was good, so it is like a big shield of the gods, who tell me, "This is your purpose here."
He says this, of course, with a THIRD voice.
So I stay with it.
I really love that.
I love to be in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is interspersed with humorous outbursts, while he imitates people again and again.
I have decided not to make a booth and comedy, because I think that this kind of immediate satisfaction from a hall full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you always look for it, you drive it in front of a wall.
I sometimes appear live in Apollo when I feel like it, but overall I don't have as much as before.
I ask him if he will ever make a stand up for comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey - I don't think I ever want to give it up again.
So is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It is fun.
You always tell a story, and that is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen ’ s capital
In the conflict between Shia ’ s Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthis called for civil disobedience in the capital city of Sana ’ a.
Huthi's supporters occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, said a spokesman for the Huthi's "Ansar Allah" party.
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi's leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for the measures on Sunday evening.
According to the paper, Huthi threatened a further escalation of the conflict if his demands were not met.
The Shiite Huthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni Yemeni and are demanding the resignation of the government.
The Huthi tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the large access routes of Sana ’ a.
In the surrounding area, bloody battles with the Yemeni army continue.
Kenya registers officials to contain "ghost workers"
Kenya has begun to register all state officials biometrically to delete "ghost workers" from the government's pay lists.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, was a government statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive pay even after they leave the public service.
When President Uhuru Kenyatta took office in 2013, he promised to combat corruption in the public service.
A review earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£7 million) per month was lost in payments for "ghost workers" and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials will now have to appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded, has been communicated in a government message.
All those who would not do so without a credible apology were deleted from the salary list, the communication went on.
"This approach makes a significant contribution to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also cleaning up the payroll at both levels of government - thus eliminating the" ghost workers ", said Anne Waiguru, Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal surrounding the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be tried in court for the first time on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, are demanding damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil trial at the Düsseldorf Regional Court.
This was announced by a court officer on Monday.
The claim states that Achenbach has cheated on the purchase of works of art and vintage cars and that Berthold Albrecht has calculated higher than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission was higher.
Achenbach bought valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He was 44 years in school, 23 of them as headmaster.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many well-known Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as a pupil.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always supported by his aspiration to see man in the disciple.
Schneekoppe is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau / Northern Bohemia, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14 he was already interested in the profession of teachers after four years of secondary school.
One year later the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour the family had to leave their house.
After a few months in a camp it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
So it went to the Oberfränkische Senkendorf.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
In addition, Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week ten kilometers to the next station, take the train to Bamberg, go there three kilometers across the whole city to school and return in the evening.
After two months Manfred Richter got a sleeping opportunity in a Red Cross Home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 classmates in a dormitory.
In 1951, he made the first state examination and in 1954, after three years of doctorate candidate.
Since Upper Franconia did not have a free teacher for him, he applied to Upper Bavaria and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "Miss" room was his first "service flat" in the school building.
In 1958 he moved to the newly built teacher ’ s house next to the school.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school in Kollbach was dissolved in 1968.
Until then there were three classes in Kollbach in Petershausen and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968 / 69 these were summarized in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl changed to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to obtain the present building from September 1982, which was extended in 1997 after Richter's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who additionally had a workshop built at municipal costs and during the extension of the cellar rooms in 1997, although this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," Richter remembered thankfully.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government representative who had replied to a lecture by a school council on justice and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter converted what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84 year-old today.
And he had to learn: "It doesn't always succeed". Whether he means only his students or just his own six children is not quite clear.
In any case, Richter ’ s actions were sometimes unconventional.
When pupils beat themselves, they did not get a criminal work from him, nor were they thundered to sit after.
At the expense of the community, Richter had two pairs of boxing gloves purchased and let the two opponents compete against each other, even if there should be a violet.
For the sake of the school, Richter as Rector maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
After his retirement, he moved the non-partisan judge to run for the municipal council in 1996, at least as the last on the CSU ’ s list.
But judges were elected to sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4 RADTOUR 700 cyclists stop in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
When cyclists take a break on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, it is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the number of stops alone made an impression: The 700 participants of the hr4 cycling tour including the accompanying horse enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later an open-air party in the Schottener Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Cycling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants had met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: The cyclists took the first stage, the 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Schotten in attack.
In Bad Salzhausen the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans Peter Seum, who had started in Bad Vilbel by bicycle, and the head of the own company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing and Döring.
For the refreshment of body and mind, all kinds of good things had been prepared: the rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, plum, scattered and cheese cake, which sounded wonderful to the capable cyclists.
"Such cakes can only bake countrywomen," praised a participant from Aulendiebach, while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be bought at the drinks booth of the gymnastics club Geiß and Nidda.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and received enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserves it, after all, he has already fastened off bicycle chains again".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the plant manager still had to work: they were interviewed at the fountain in front of the drinking spa house by reporter Rainer Janke and took the opportunity to advertise for Bad Salzhausen on the radio.
Also doctoral director Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4 cycling tour in 2004 as tour leader, could only briefly take a breather, had to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his staff and the 15-man motorcycle squadron of the police of Hesse via three telephones and a radio, and he wrote Facebook inserts and made reports, also needed a check.
"Most of the participants come from the Rhine Main region," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia cyclists arrived.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available accommodation capacity.
In category I the participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodations.
From the spa the cyclists had a good impression when they set out again after one and a half hours: "Chess!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved to say goodbye.
After arriving in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Schottener Gesellschaft für Tourismus und Stadtmarketing (GTS) the park had a nice festive ambience and of course they had prepared treats, such as flame cake with well chilled feather whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS CEO Markus Hoßfeld and MSC CEO Wolfgang Wagner and Sachs welcomed the visitors in his capacity as member of the board of ADAC Hessen Thüringen.
The three were visibly pleased about the "many operation in Scots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move under the open air was eagerly used despite the sporting activity on the bicycle.
Among the guests, there were more and more citizens who were impressed by the good atmosphere as well as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwaldern - were on the programme.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, the athletes arrived in Bad Vilbel again.
Dozens of Turkish policemen arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 policemen were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", reported local media agencies.
The police authorities did not make an immediate comment.
Among those arrested are 14 senior police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish policemen were arrested for allegedly establishing an organized criminal association and tapping telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described their actions as part of the activities led by Islamist clergy Fethulla Güllen against him and other people in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful everywhere over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian popular front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, principal of the school in Slavyansk, who visited Yatsenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally prevail here again and that children will receive an education that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC has perhaps found the great director she needs.
It arrives with a proud tow of fame from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And she has her own frontal experience.
Her career began at the global management consulting company Bain and Co., where she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was Chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when Pearsons ’ top position went to a younger male colleague.
Their severance payment allegedly amounted to almost £1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became the cabinet advisor.
Her husband is a former Tory councillor.
Already in May I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned chalice.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inwardly on the first guard of one ’ s own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outwardly as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This ensures an almost untenable duopoly, which calls for a complete comprehensive reform.
But what new leader would risk stepping in, hitting everything, and dismantling an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps taking his own job.
It is a difficult task.
And as if that were not enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC shrunk - power, money, and status outdated.
As the competition moves closer and new technologies threaten old, convenient collateral, the upcoming negotiation of the BBC's licensing fees is associated with particular dangers.
For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public buys into the world ’ s certainly largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that it reaches 96 per cent of all households and costs each of them only 40 per day.
And apparently the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get messages on my phone nowadays and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she has found him.
Perry from Texas says that lowering tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a lowering remark about the Democratic District Attorney, who is at the center of a criminal indictment against him for abuse of authority.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another one from Perry ’ s user account that denied the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account, which was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve of the tweet and deleted it," said the later message.
Perry staff did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets were based on Perry ’ s official user account, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the previous tweet, an unfavorable picture of the District Attorney of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, which was sentenced in April 2013 for drunkenness at the wheel.
Perry vetoed her office ’ s financial support when she refused to resign, leading to an indictment against Perry – who might be presidential candidate in 2016 – in front of a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweet reads: "I'm not always drunk with the triple permissible alcohol level... but if I do, I'll accuse Governor Perry when he trumpets it out."
I am the most drunken democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg ’ s office was not entrusted with the management of the Grand Jury ’ s investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the indictment a political trick.
His high-class team of legal advisers asked the case judge to dismiss the indictment and argued that the law that was passed against the most senior governor in the history of the state of Texas is unexpectedly diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state money to the state's Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and investigates in cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto brought a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth at Iowa Electoral Assemblies during his 2012 presidential candidature, Perry speculated that he would stop posting a tweet of a photo of himself while jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we are coming!"
Berkeley declares housing market "normal" again
One of London ’ s most prominent contractors pointed out that the housing market in the southeast of England has returned to normal levels.
Own homes in the capital were highly sought-after and the subject of huge price increases, causing the Bank of England to impose mortgage credit limits in June, owing to the widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "Since the start of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak in 2013" and added that this offers a "stable action environment".
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information provided by the cadastral office, prices in the urban area alone increased by 18.5 percent last year, much more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
Berkeley ’ s average retail prices for private, inexpensive and student offerings rose by about one-fifth last year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.
A stronger pound, however, has made property ownership in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "villa tax" before the general elections next May.
Last week, the London real estate broker Foxton warned that the April mortgage market report, which introduced tighter lending regimes, would also lead to lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also suggests that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the rise in real estate prices in London in 2015 down to 3%, based on an already weakening house price awareness.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now declined by a quarter year after year, according to brokerage agent WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, as the due amounts for futures sales amount to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and the futures sales remained stable as a result."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes until the end of April - almost a third more than the 2007 pre-crisis peak.
Annual pre-tax income rose by 40 percent to £280 million annually, and sales by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
In a statement on Monday before the company ’ s Annual Meeting, Mr Pidgley said that Berkeley ’ s revenues are expected to meet current market expectations this year.
Analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result at £450 million in agreement.
Berkeley Shares were fixed at £23.96 in London in the afternoon.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence Performance at the 85th Academy Awards.
Nude photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images from another 100 starlets.
One of the stars from "The Tributes of Panem" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were genuine and accused the hacker of "blatant violation of privacy."
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on Apple ’ s iCloud Online Storage System (iCloud) photo sharing page 4chan were supposedly acquired by a gap. BuzzFeed reported the alleged “master list ” of hacking victims, which includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Mary Theresa Olsen.
It is not certain how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star of "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who have taken photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you are really satisfied with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the nickolodeone series "iCarly" and "Victorious", however, denied that the photos were pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called nude pictures of me are FALLOWED, people.
Let ’ s wake up to the beginnings. * Word game intended *.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a speaker of pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They flowed, so one could best describe it, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard, which was left in the rain.
Occasionally a woman told him that he was too serious, exhausting, intense, distanced and perhaps a little scratch-brushed.
And then shook his hand.
He knew scratch-brush.
He was prickly, as in hedgehogs, yes.
The last victim of this stinginess was a just beginning affair, which had been more promising for a relief of the lonely boredom of his life than otherwise, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling tender beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion who kept Kevern as her aunt, and had inherited a plot of land in a damp but paradisiacal valley called Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The tubes were leaky, in the baths there were spiders, nudibranchs had left their traces on all windows and believed that all this belonged to them, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge cabbage heads.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both threatening and enticing, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the Longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn holding hands on the broken loungers in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had clung mentally absent into the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing news, when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer, whom his father had liked to listen to in the house with closed shutters.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was so properly forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully obsolete, just as the word obsolete.
The general taste succeeded in what decrees and regulations would never have achieved, and how the people in books choose the From Disc Wash to Millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and love novels, so they chose the ballads in the music.
In the euphoria of the day Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing great feet in a coarsely comical serenade of Ailinn.
Ailinn did not understand that.
"This was a well-known song of a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It had not been a very funny game at that time, and it was not very funny even now.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard whom.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not directly forbidden.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for one "if" in life.
People wanted to be quite sure where they would end at the beginning of a melody.
Likewise the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he was 10 years old without having heard about Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father ’ s half-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he did not have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age she probably could not remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, no laws or constraints applied.
A compliant society meant that each element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group giftedness - thankfully as those spared from fate.
People of African Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sport through temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were, as if by nature, blessed with electronic talent and were in charge of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service telephone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of sewerage; what was left of the Greeks shattered plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents had not left the country quickly as WHAT HAPPY WAS WHEN IT HAS HAPPENED WAS done out of fear of being accused of fire-shooting, out of fear even that the flames would consume them next - had opened Labneh- and Shisha 'pipes' restaurants, kept in mind and became depressed with the inaction.
Everyone according to his abilities.
As she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just sung to her could ever be set to music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They aren't really insulting," Kevern said.
Except perhaps for people whose feet are too big.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge coal-like leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why should your father have loved such a thing?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She already thought that he was something strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head unfaithfully and blocked Keverns sight.
There was nothing else to see all over the world than her uncombed raben-black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
"If you say it," they say it without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
She seemed to be honestly concerned.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet are not so direct.
Maybe your ankle, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Do you hate?
Of course I don't hate you.
That is just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you", but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankle is exactly why you please me," he tried instead.
I'm a bit perverse there.
That did not sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the soothing charm needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel.
Perhaps he, Kevern, wanted to be that.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and rose out of her deck chair, threw the console over and spilled the wine they had drunk.
Elderflower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble, like Palmwedel in the storm.
"And your fat head is exactly the reason why I feel drawn to you perversely," she said...
Except that I am not at all.
She was sorry, both for the unnecessary unfriendliness of his words and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she rose up against him.
Did she think he would beat her?
She had not told him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more boisterous after WHAT HAPPY WAS when their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise their hands against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a thick fist if she didn't watch out!
They first slip - Knutschen was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the non-telling love ballads from the console - they first slip and then beat.
According to Keverns, this was an unnecessary refinement, since Knutschen himself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to walk through her body.
He rose from the deck chair like an old man.
She also felt stuck, but the force of his grief surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him move away - just as her companion watched him from a room on the upper floor - a man, complaining about something he himself had summoned.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was that a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time when she had seen such a thing before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomon looked at her feet.
Several years before the events just told, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for public sentiment, worked on a brief lecture on the continued violence at a low and medium level in precisely those parts of the country where its reduction, if not abolition, would have been most likely to be expected, considering the funds and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"Much has already been done, and much still needs to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people that has waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country where the sweet breath of human friendliness has rarely been felt historically, despite the towering church towers between the hedges.
But some characteristics turn out to be inextricable.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the lower the passion it continues to awaken.
The population cries when listening to sentimental ballads, intoxicated with stories about overcome difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but yet not only the former brutality holds rural communities as well as our urban fabric firmly in hand, but there are also evidence for the emergence of a new and insidious dispute at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," said their mentor when he read the whole report.
I suggest that you read fewer novels.
Esme walnut lowered her head.
I must also ask: are you atheist?
"I don't have to say that," answered Esme Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Again Esme invoked her right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I am against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a prejudice-free job.
We serve a society free of prejudice.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are in themselves absolutely acceptable and commendable, may occasionally distort results as you have presented them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you call "sneaky" and "raw", could be interpreted by others just as well as an expression of a natural force and vitality.
If we continue to ride around WHAT IS HAPPENING, WHEN IT IS HAPPENING, as if, if it had happened, it had happened yesterday, it means taking the country's essential vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice Ofnow had given the country in the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely what you want," answered Esme Nussbaum with a calm voice when she was sure that her superior had finished speaking, "and I say nothing other than that we are not yet healed as effectively as we pretend to ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to WHAT IS HAPPENING IF IT HAS BEEN.
This time, however, it is not the others that we omit our anger and mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
In order to indicate an angel patience.
"You go too far," he said, "if you call actions" errors "that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
You also go too far when you say that they have omitted their "anger" and "distrust" of "others".
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past as well as when protecting the present, we do not speak of "us" and "others".
There was no "we" and there were no "others".
It was a time of disorder, that is all we know.
"Of which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to throw in, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I do not accuse anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well what happened has happened.
That was back then.
Nothing has to be said about this - we agree.
And just as no guilt has to be assigned, no guilt must be blotted out if such repayment is appropriate and if there is a way to eradicate it.
But what serves the past if we do not learn from it -
The past serves to make us forget them.
If I may say something about it -
Luther Rabinowitz dropped his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said and dismissed her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was crossed by a motorcyclist who, as passers-by described, had gone on foot in a kind of "brutal rage".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho Military member says that no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officials in Lesotho denied having planned a coup d ’ état to overthrow the government, saying that they were taking action against policemen accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the country ’ s army had surrounded its official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The prime minister brought his family to adjacent South Africa after reporting on attacks.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that de facto there was no coup d'état, but that the military responded to the threat posed by "political fanatics", whose armament was needed by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of Lesotho's defense forces acted after receiving several intelligence reports that within the police some elements actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were about to cause devastating damage," he said to Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that the military action had made the impression of a revolution.
"Although no one has claimed to have seized the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defence forces have so far shown signs of a coup d'état," he said.
Speakers of the Lesotho military announced on Sunday that the soldiers would return to their barracks and that the situation in the capital would be calm.
In the meantime, the Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over governance during Thabane ’ s absence.
Thabane said that he believed that he had become the target because of his attempt to combat corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there has been great tension since June, after Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings due to the conflicts in his unitary government.
He said that his actions had not undermined the government, despite other accusations.
Production in the Eurozone on a 13 month low
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed down in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months, according to a closely observed study.
The final Markit Purchasing Manager Index of Manufacturing (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, at 51.8 in July.
A specification over 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went down and factories experienced breakdowns at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures arrive before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan to deal with a hesitant eurozone recovery, as well as the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of just 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could give further information later this week about whether he is considering quantitative relief for the eurozone, according to those made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
The PMI factory for Germany, Russia ’ s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc ’ s second largest economic nation, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as well as the decline of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Indications that growth incentives in key industrial mechanism no longer apply to Germany, Spain and the Netherlands are also not reassuring, "said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fires of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
Positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say for the purchasing manager index of the manufacturing industry in the eurozone in August is that the sector continues to grow afterwards."
He added: "Producers in the eurozone are obviously finding life quite difficult at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions - especially in relation to Russia and Ukraine - are increasing uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence - and are likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, particularly major orders.
He said that it would be "ever more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to launch a kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The decade of hell of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children involved in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militia at a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death at the atrocity in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the appalling siege of the Beslan School, where 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new Apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the evil of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death at the atrocity in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now plaguing Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed trying to climb back into the school sports hall
She was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and famous when she tried only in her underwear to climb back into the crushed school sports hall after a mine had exploded.
Completely confused Aida searched for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," Aida said at that time.
My legs were blood-flooded.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought them to safety.
After a series of operations, she considered herself completely healed, but yesterday said, "Three months ago the pain returned.
I am afraid that I have to be operated again.
Some grenade splinters are still in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist to help people how doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says in a fighting fashion.
"That happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small, and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of her, although the memory becomes a little weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of myself online as I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophe and help that something like this does not happen again.
The boy who fled through the bullet hail, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion he thought she would die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fear that she could be dead, he fled and saw a weeping toddler on the way, seized it by the hand, and fled through a bullet hail.
His father Vladimir, who closed his son in his arms outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality Tamara had stumbled outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, in turn assuming that her son had died.
After her reunification she said, "I cried with joy.
I could not believe it.
He ran in and embraced me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now dissolved newspaper News of the World) to get the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror persecutes you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that in my memory it becomes paler.
I still know that right after that I threw away all my toy guns.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that is no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember these children with whom I played in the yard, and who did not make it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say that they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy shop, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open top car.
But now he is afraid of place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the atrocities," said Damir, who last week worked as a volunteer in a monastery.
I want to help so gladly.
One day I want to go to the police and hope that they will take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighbourhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She vividly recalls her trip to London with Damir.
The people of London cried when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London, and how that helped me and Damir.
I still remember how Damir liked to eat Borschtsch and they called all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot at them with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, "I always think that this world has not become better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is now continuing, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are exactly the same children as ours.
I think that for many the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past atrocities.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and light candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember how he sometimes lay down on the sofa, his face turned away from us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. 17, bigger than me, is now good-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got on my legs, I looked around, and saw hell around me, with body parts lying around everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
"I remember that I called to him," Damir, run, run away ", but I was also so sure that he had not heard me.
But he heard it, and he ran away.
And so life goes on for us, unlike that of many others.
Georgiy Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the abominations of Beslan
Consolation: The Beslan ’ s survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege of 2004, right a picture of Georgij today
His blood-flooded face was marked by fear as he ran around his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of Beslan ’ s most shocking symbols of barbarism.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dismissed him for his first day of school before she hurried to bring her elder son Vladimir to university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she remembers.
Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date approaches, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day on which we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's long ago, I mean it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days always follow me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Impressive: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school that day. He said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew that he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the weeping Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not like the picture, and it is hidden at home in the bookshelf.
I understand this, but I also think that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
People repeatedly investigate such tragedies and never experience the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of these Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world becomes something terrible.
"I cannot understand how this is possible, because when you ask people, nobody wants war, so how does it happen?
Ten years are nothing at all with such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
Later in 2004 I went back to school and was afraid every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That is why I always go to the sports hall when 1 September approaches.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friend.
It is hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I do not feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I don't regret it.
My life continues.
I graduated from school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I will become a cardiac surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health did not allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgiy Faniyev, 20
The boy who survived although he was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgiy Faniyev was trapped during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb, which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is really a miracle that he was not killed.
"We feel it was yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I am older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that is not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and after that I felt a bit better, but I can't forget.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time that I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return there again and please do not ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgiy Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is immense and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think or talk about it and they never asked me about the school.
Physically it is good for me.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can now run well.
But because of my health I could not study at the FSB's intelligence academy in Saint Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical documents, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have already two years behind me there.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know about this, and they should not, of course, suffer.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He is in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go to the celebrations to commemorate.
I know that Georgiy will not go.
It must be much harder for him because he was there and I did not.
I waited for him at home and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. Here in Beslan, all of them are drawn.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It is difficult to accept that when something like that happens to you.
He is a boy, he likes sports, but he cannot participate because of his knee.
He has been operated on several times, he can run but does not do any sport.
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always persecute us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and this only reinforces my pain.
I have lost many people who I knew well and who were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could give me, but my heart cries for the slain.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who never got married again.
It is hard to accept that life continues, even if you do not want it.
I will never forget my heart leaping inside me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I almost cannot believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we now fight?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If we could only attack and throw out all these rebels - as far away as possible.
Alyona Tskayeva, 10
The baby that was so moved by a special command in safety
Saved: Alyona Tskayeva is brought into safety by a Russian special command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the cruelties at all
The world breathed in 2004 when baby Aljona was carried out in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but in her cruelty her 30 year old mother, the 10 year old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar held back in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father Ruslan has since married again and has with his new wife Svetlana a little girl that he has named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, neighbours say.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man accused of having crossed girls on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78 year-old man is on trial for the trial of a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of having approached a girl on the transition to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The indictment states that Mr. Steward had managed his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and had injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the accusation before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC started the trial for January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to take photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point of view and shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action Cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, which are both available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also adjust your camera to the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the insulating underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is working.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Look for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models in our shopping guide and reviews.
Make multiple recordings - because many won't fold.
Point-to-Shoot cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images, Action Cams usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this under water, and the right image setting is a matter of luck.
So you make many shots.
If your camera has a row mode that makes a series of shots with slightly modified exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse the further you get away from the surface.
If possible, you will stay close to the surface when taking pictures in a pool, lake or sea.

Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changed things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an advisory anaesthetist, he devoted his career to saving the sick from both the agony of the disease and the pain of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that diagnoses and illnesses are important to doctors, while the patients are predominantly occupied with something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble mocking myself.
While fighting with flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he impatiently reproached his wife Juliet.
"I'd rather do it immediately than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and unreasonably worried.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to conduct an X-ray examination of his chest.
Just two weeks ago he had been in the French Alps for skiing.
The result of the X-ray investigation was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the thoracic skin, i.e. the skin covering the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been smokers earlier.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which was once regarded as a "miracle material" but has meanwhile been recognized as fatal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can easily ignore.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos was no longer used in Britain since the 1960s, when industry voluntarily committed to no longer using it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain sectors worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another time, it hardly seems to be worrying today.
But this complacency is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing today the culmination of a mesolthelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease than from road accidents.
Annual numbers of Mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and prospective future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999) is that a mesothelioma only develops after decades.
And the scourge of Mesothelioma is not limited to former workers of construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still, present in the houses where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we learn and the shops where we shop.
And therefore Mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, occupations or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a shelter.
The Parliament buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been identified as the starting point.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was also not a plumber.
It was indeed difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years training," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least in part.
"Of the four doctors who have been trained at Guy's Hospital and who have had Mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one who is still alive."
How many of us will still get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.
That was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within 8 months after diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will still get sick?"
The UK ’ s leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, if the asbestos epidemic is expected to come to an end in Britain, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have been killed.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this.

A brief look at the files of the courts, to which the persons concerned frequently turn for claims for damages, shows how far the scourge of the mesothelioma is already widespread.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer admitted for example that Janice had negligently suspended asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M & S.
Now she has two children in the twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of Mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I would never have thought that this would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three out of six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most frequently found asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it is nevertheless regarded by the EU and the WHO as a "major health risk" with possible death consequences.
But more dangerous is the brown asbestos (amosite) and the blue asbestos (crokydolite).
Britain was once the world ’ s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that “there are clear but indirect indications that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates. ”
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to Alamy at the flagship store on Oxford Street, London, Asbest
Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of those affected in which it is shown that "an essential proportion of mesotheliomas without known exposure was probably caused by work or in the home by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks as if no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows how people, even in the heart of the government, might have been unknowingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009 Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament's committees were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibres could be whirled up by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it seems that the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the West Minster Palace had received a "clean health certificate", it is now indisputable that £1 billion of work has to be spent over several years to renovate the Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that after the general elections in 2015 MEPs will probably meet in the nearby QE2 conference center rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled according to the respective provisions."
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is wait.
A person who has never been able to precisely determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50 years old, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos lawsuits were positively decided," he says, "but I cannot prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places you have worked on and the data.
What he reminds himself of is the day at the beginning of December 2009, on which he got a kind of fever.
He was 45, and performed an operation just late in the evening.
Suddenly I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn ’ t think I could make the trip home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pains of the thorax, the skin around his lungs, were arising.
But like Janice Allen he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He did not go to work for a month.
Admired doctors made x-rays of his chest and used pleuracathether to remove fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after exercise and intense breathing.
In 2011 a patient of Abbotts with similar symptoms came to his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011 Abbotts condition worsened again and his family doctor brought his CT and X-ray scans to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt ill for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was inserted into the cave between the rib and breast fur.
I am an optimist.
I usually just carry on, "he says.
Honestly, I had not even worried so many.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was between Christmas and New Year: "They told me that it was Mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan ’ s nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where tubes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill.
And so Mesothelioma now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos isolation in hospitals lay underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many people who went from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) most likely came into contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for treating doctors.
It is still being removed today.
Students placed their Bunsenbrenner on asbestos mats.
And it does not only concern hospitals.
Due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties, asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls.
Schools too.
Indeed, many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have put their Bunsenbrenner on asbestos mats.
The topic asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed on websites.
Meanwhile, such innocent items have been included in our homes as floor slabs or shed compartments by default.
"It is an industrial poison that is contained in much of our real estate," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to a woman concerned was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So watch out for how you tear off your garden shed.
The effects of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are immense.
"It takes a while to process this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I could not concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew that I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I will not experience another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to cope with.
"It was very difficult to record it all," he says.
"I asked my doctor," how long do I have? "
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember that I thought, "Well, I won't see another Christmas.
That was it "."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life-keeping mechanism - breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is swirled up and the fibres are inhaled, they can be fixed in the thorax, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the thorax and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibres," says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart of the thorax doctor who changed to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital of which Andrew Lawson suspects that it has exposed him to asbestos is now ironically a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were presumably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From the very beginning it is invasive by nature.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well with mesothelioma.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is highly controversial.
Some believe that it is worth trying.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the breast fur," he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy", which "shows effect", but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Graham Abbott is still struggling two and a half years after his own diagnosis.
After he contacted Mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, had become a One man Support and Advisory Office for those affected.
"Hello, Cancer Center", he introduced himself cheerfully when calling.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that would last four months and probably prolong his life by only one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed "to make things appear in a somewhat more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang Lazdunski, Heart of Thorax and Guy's specialist.
"We had an advantage because I didn't have to be redirected, I just called and got an appointment," says Graham.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But if these treatments eventually fail, many people are left with another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.
But what has changed in the 1960s is that it was recognized that even a very low burden was a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally admitted their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full compensation", since Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, after the investigation of his death, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the affected basement area in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
Indeed, it is a huge problem for Mesothelioma, who seek compensation, to assign fatal asbestos contact to a company or workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who defend themselves against claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this, there have been clear new legislation this year, which makes it easier for Mesothelioma to sue for compensation, even if their former employers are no longer available.
The law has established a £350 million fund for all those diagnosed after July 2012, who are able to prove contact, but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs will receive 80 percent of what a court could have attributed to them in a normal compensation process - about £120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many Mesothelioma patients, thinks that £350 million was a "very good job" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal between insurers for insurers," he says, suggesting that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the time had not gone over and Mesothelioma's sufferers find the companies and could sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that, in the face of seven deaths, rapid action is needed every day.
"People are suffering so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Law of December last year.
At that time Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her initial deliberations, Lang Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expects a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent for five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course the most important thing," says Abbott.
This can be seen again and again in patients.
There is something that lets you continue.
When you give up, you get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just became 50th
This is not life-threatening.
That is vital.
Abbott again underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of tumours is visible.
But the process is physically and psychologically very exhausting.
You have to think of practical things - about money when I am no longer, for example, or my wife showing how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you become negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"This is difficult for parents," he says.
It is hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease with which I would not grow old.
They reacted quite differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for Mesothelioma sufferers, such conversations are not permeated by hope, not a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as in the end for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to government election, demonstrators swear retaliation
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This action probably fuels the long-announced protests in Hong Kong ’ s business district, while activists initiated planning and mobilization within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People ’ s Congress basically allows Communist leaders to reject all non-peking candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
That is not what Beijing had promised.
The inhabitants of Hong Kong were attracted.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations to the Hong Kong government elections was too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Great Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let its residents elect its head office from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday ’ s decision as a democratic breakthrough, because Hong Kong ’ s citizens have a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the process in its hands through a closely Beijing controlled nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates should be allowed "with love of the country and love of Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the biggest and most popular protests in Hong Kong have taken place for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut off the financial district if Beijing does not permit genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy ’ s Central supporters had gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong ’ s government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobedience and that they were planning waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further information, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online announcement, the organizers announced that the movement "considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action that should only take place if all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and that the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing ’ s announcement for days, and security measures, including police forces and barricades, were intensified on Sunday in front of the government building.
The unrest is amplified by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The arrival of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
Furthermore, there is growing fear that Hong Kong ’ s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, will begin to crumble under growing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticised the Occupy ’ s demonstrations because they jeopardized Hong Kong ’ s lifeblood business.
"The protests they are talking about could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to worry about Hong Kong getting out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China ’ s state-controlled media also recently reported on Hong Kong ’ s democracy activists as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on voting rights in which 780.000 people took part – more than a fifth of Hong Kong ’ s voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the region ’ s history.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the USA is now being transferred to the universities, where Freshmen appearances with the private plane are offered.
We look forward to responding to this demand and offering the UK ’ s first luxury travel service for today ’ s students.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircrafts, roll-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service had a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to take their belongings through the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and maximum luxury this year.
A company spokesman said that there were no new bookings as the service had just been introduced, but added that "students would book the service in the next few weeks".
The company also announced that, despite the tuition fees of £9,000 per year, it expects a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do exactly that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as withdrawn.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NIS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start studying this month face a crisis of living costs, as the available financial support in the form of loans and scholarships does not keep up with the sharply rising bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as arriving at the student dormitory.
Feminists criticize race question and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants lifted their hands in the air and sang, "Hands high, not shoot" while they waited before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
In their experience, white feminist commentators put the sex before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive law and income inequalities.
However, while tensions in the Middle West increased and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that white women ’ s responses turned 100% around the race.
Compared with the responses of black women shortly after the shots of August 9, personal essays with titles like "Thoughts on Ferguson of a White Woman" and "Feminism is not just about suppressing women" came relatively late.
But for Perez this meant an important change.
"I don't think that in feminism there are many people who speak about the white and privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they must express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University Ferguson brought problems to light, to which black Americans are exposed every day, but which are not considered as "women's themes" in the cultural area.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," Mitchell said.
When I post something about how colored people are under siege in their own country, silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the US, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the themes cleanly; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now link race and gender in feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, Professor of Women and Gender Research at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify lynching.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came at the point where white female fighters analyzed the country in the late 19th century for women ’ s suffrage, such as Susan B. Anthony, and found that the struggle for the right to vote could only be successful for one group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to stand up for women's right to vote, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," said Hattery.
When one recalls such things, one becomes aware with power why colored women do not trust white women.
We did not do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize against Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group originated almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist responses to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "catching" the problems black women have been grappling with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to educate a child as seriously as they do with the right to receive control?" Mitchell asked.
Feminists of the second generation, who built up their careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means, are now trying to understand what this means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown was shot and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, calling for more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions on the race that are clearly different in public surveys - will lead the changes," wrote Steiner.
Although Steiner stands for a more intersectional feminism that addresses racial and gender issues, some of her comments on racial issues in America are astounded.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks on Ferguson are contrary to her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steiner.
The police ’ s relationship with the black community is not the only problem that comes to the fore of mainstream feminism.
After the US Border Police has picked up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the south-west border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform is coming to the surface again - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, Co-Chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a re-examination of the issue as an essential women ’ s theme, it only needs to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women accompanying them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories echo in women's organisations," she said.
"Pigs" house in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed from real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £120,000.
Among the details was a picture of the living room of the house - to which also a pig belonged that had bedded his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig on the photo was the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was erroneously published and has now been removed," said a company spokesperson.
In the exposé of the house Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique one-family house with one bedroom."
Although the broker removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
The sale of the house caused interest in the social media, when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
After lottery win, the SW is home to a new millionaire
A lottery player from Harvey is on this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a lucky winner receiving almost $1.1 million from lottery draw on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey pulled the jackpot for the second time in five years in the drawing of the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
But the lucky winner still has to register.
The shopkeeper Steve Forward said the profit provided for conversation in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city speaks of nothing else, and everyone is quite excited.
We thought that such a profit could occur.
Eight WA winners have celebrated winnings in the first division last month, a due conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont made a $7.5 million mega-win just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple had played for twenty years and said the win allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of nearly $85 million.
Leonidas asked in the gladiator arena
Not only the gladiators stood in the mud at the first Rheinbach Römertag in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1000 visitors yesterday, who braved the rain showers and the autumn cold and were completely enthralled by the historical spectacle.
There was a colourful array of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter troop from the gladiator school "Amor Mortis", which used every rainy break to demonstrate their robust martial art in the arena with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and subsequently sent his men into the ring for heroic duel in various types of gladiators.
First the "Provocatoren" were on the row with rectangular shield and short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
It followed the "Essedarii" with breast shield, short sword and root as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm guard.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who started with throwing nets, trident and dagger against the "Secutor" and after a short fight pushed the boys to the ground.
There the swords crawled metallic to each other, the shields sheppered and the root plants flew surrend through the arena that could become a fear and fear for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, always had an attentive eye on them.
"We wanted to revive Roman everyday life and to make the culture of the Roman era tangible", explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Freundeskreis Römerkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the amusement park became an "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, as Vice-Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting speech.
After all, the Romans not only brought war and conquest to our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of it were to be admired also during the Roman day, for example "aqueduct - marble" of the eleven meters high and 1400 meters long Roman canal - bridge, which once stood near Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once and now faced the water and energy supply, and managing director Petra Fricke knew: "We still derive benefits from the knowledge of that time".
This also confirms diploma of surveying engineer Ralph Heiliger of the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the warm air heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
Impressive also the footprints, which had been left by Wolf and Fuchs in the footsteps of clay two millennia ago, before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for Ground Monument Care at the Landesverband Rheinland excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Gewerbepark Nord in Rheinbach.
One had found enclosure walls of a farm building with a darre for drying grain and rolling.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
She presented a number of finds from these excavations in a glass showcase, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the invasions of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
The children also dealt with the Roman windmill game, similar to today ’ s windmill game, or they wrote their names with metal handles on growth boards like the Roman pupils once did.
At the stand of Römerthermen Zülpich the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, tinker glass mosaics at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach and use a heavy wheat mill made of stone at the stand of the nature center Eifel Nettersheim to grind the flour for a flat bread or a muesli.
The visitors drove through the amusement park with the faithfully reconstructed Roman coaches, drawn by two cold-blooded horses, passing the impressive stand of the Städtische Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman project weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the Wachtberg congregation will also contribute to the Roman Year 2014, which was proclaimed in Rhineland-Westphalia and commemorates the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the local and historical associations as well as the Wachtberg hiking association, the partnership association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings as well as guided tours for school classes will be offered and the Roman past of Wachtberg will be remembered.
For example, a Roman legionary is told about his work on the pertinent Wachtberg, plants are presented as living monuments from the Roman era, and a witty lesson is offered in matters of international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germanies" and inbound Romans.
The Adendorf primary school is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Roman week the numerous, often but no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be made tangible again.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus, a small presentation will recall the discovery of the Berkumer Matronenheiligtum in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic burdens West Africa ’ s economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies are at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a serious blow to the West African economy.
The crop is rotting on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets orphaned - the virus has severely added to the region.
Some international companies are already at a distance.
“The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis but also an economic one, ” says Donald Kaberuka, head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is hardest hit
"It's a total disaster, we're losing a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola are on the market.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, and here alone more than 600 people fell victim to the fever.
Recently, health authorities said that the disease had penetrated every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
Altogether more than 1500 people already died, thousands of others got stuck.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Companies operate everywhere in resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal withdraw their employees and several international airlines no longer fly to the affected regions.
The local traders and farmers also react: only a few merchants leave their homes to obtain supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are quarantined, among other things, the cocoa and coffee beans important for export on the fields rot.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is becoming scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert on West Africa's economy.
For example, the man who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables will rather stay at home.
The population will therefore feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is becoming scarce.
In the markets, stocks of staple foods such as rice are declining.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, threatens an image download - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French Think Tank Iris.
It was crucial how far and how long the virus would spread.
With investors the impression could arise "that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and therefore also to invest", warns Hugon.
The disease also burdens the state budgets of the states
The disease also burdens the already strained state budgets of the affected states.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be heavily strained by the high expenditure on the health system and additionally by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are also noticeable in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
Although the oil-rich region in the southern Niger delta has not been affected so far.
But elsewhere, many people already remain at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels are also significantly reduced.
shooters celebrate their 50th anniversary
The shooting club "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates from 12 to 14 September its 50 year founding party.
At the Schützenverein Tannenwald, preparations for the 50th anniversary of the founding party are running at full speed from 12 to 14 September.
On Friday, September 12, a big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker" is planned.
On Saturday is at 18 o'clock the big Böllerschießen.
Afterwards in the big marquee is the mood evening with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam".
Brass band provides the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festive service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the big procession at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of the Federal and Gaussian shootings.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 Festdamen with their Dirndln.
Festkapelle is the brass band Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker took over the patronage.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when on 21 March the association was founded for "social entertainment by means of exercise in room cleaning and small caliber shooting".
The Nazi regime had caused the club to be dissolved in 1937.
It was only in 1964 that 19 young men found themselves again, who on April 30 baptized the "new" Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau in the Gasthaus Lukas.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club as shooting champion through a difficult beginning time, in which it was primarily about finding a club and installing the shooting operation.
Already in autumn 1965 the shooting club started in the restaurant "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the athletes, who were now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records crisscrossed every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the performance of active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the "Leininger" club has no longer satisfied the demands of a modern shooting club, the then board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future domicile in the basement rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a work of 2700 hours, Pastor Strasser gave the church blessing for the new shooting rooms on 8 May 1988.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th Gauschießen, combined with the solemn consecration of the new trotting flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994 the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995 a group of mercenaries was founded.
Josef Schmalzl became a Böllerreferent.
A big challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böllertreffen 2005.
In many hours of voluntary work last year, the members of the association modernized the rooms and the shooting range in the Berngauer Hof and thus brought it to the latest state of technology.
Eleven teams in round competitions
You can also see the sporting achievements of the shooting club.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the round competitions: six air rifle teams, one air pistol team, one sports pistol KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann has risen in the 2013 / 14 round from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) into the 1st round.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from Gauliga Nord to Gauoberliga.
Apart from shooting, events such as Bockstechen, Faschings- and Königsball, club excursion and Christmas party have tradition.
The shooters are also present at the festivals in parish and parish.
Tony Stewart suffers accident when returning to the racetrack
Tony Stewart ’ s return to the race track ended roughly halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tire burst in lap 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team boss Chad Johnston said that his 14 team was disappointed, but now focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better commitment and a better result for him," Johnston said.
We drive to Richmond and hope that we can do better there.
Stewart was already driving into a wall at the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I went into a good result today with quite good hopes," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work."
Not long after the second accident Stewarts car was loaded into the tug and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver in an ash track race in the north of the state of New York.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had entered the roadway during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities announced on Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will last at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been taken as to whether Stewart has to face an indictment.
The three-time champion was greeted with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start in 12th position, Stewart had already entered the first 10 shortly thereafter and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart in lap 122, Buschs got
Car with no. 18 out of control after the exit from turn 2 and collided with Stewart, whereby both cars drove against the wall.
Stewart went on, but dropped back to position 21.
Tanzfreudiger Nachwuchs gesucht
Just try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and Head Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to comrades.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups on TV Jahn also do full day classes at secondary schools.
After the summer holidays some groups have decimated strongly.
Now young people are increasingly looking for a sport that is healthy and fun.
There are only nine children left in Lisa Neitzel's two jazz and modern dancing groups, formerly a dancer in the jazz and modern dance groups "Spirits".
"Three in the group of eight-to-twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve-to-fifteen-year-olds", the 20 year-old tells.
With more active people, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies," she says.
If you want to dance, you can take a break on Thursdays between 5 pm and 6 pm or on Fridays between 5 pm and 6 pm in the dance gym at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9.
"The training starts regularly with a warm-up program", the trainer tells.
Various choreographies are then practised.
JazzDance has the characteristic that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore, classical music, sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, sociability is not too short.
"We also go eating, watch dance films and we have already stayed in the dance room", reports Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a wonderful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
Those who don ’ t like jazz dance can also sniff into one of the other TV Jahn offers.
On Wednesdays, children and young people can take part in classes in the areas of children ’ s dance / jazz dance, Bambini and ballet, video clip and hip hop.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you want Discofox, Slow Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Rumba, Cha and Tango, you can visit and participate.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationally
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria organized a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their calls for the restoration of their old working conditions, which were recently amended.
Higher salaries are also on a list of receivables to be discussed with the Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours for a month and are calling for a return to the former 24 hour layers.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison workers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, reported the National Bulgarian Ratio (BNR).
The negotiations continue, the Director-General for the Implementation of Criminal Measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov, told the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the union union of employees of the Interior Ministry.
Ukrainian Army has abandoned Luhansk Airport
In eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian fighters are still on the rise.
After heavy battles, in which allegedly also Russian tank battalions were involved, the Ukrainian army gave up today, Monday, the airport of the rebel stronghold Luhansk.
The army also announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the last 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personnel consequences from the heavy defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the supreme army leadership without mentioning details.
Prorussian separatists shot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists once again shot down a fighter aircraft and two military helicopters.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, according to the Russian agencies on Monday.
Ships of the Coast Guard sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two boats of the Ukrainian coastguard for the first time in the Azov Sea.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships were under fire on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, a speaker in Kiev told the transmitter 112.a.s.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had brought several villages in the Donetsk region under their control.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
In the Belarusian capital Minsk, Ukraine is meeting today.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In the run-up, all actors used their performances to publicly announce their demands.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned deployment in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO's Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adheres to the founding agreement of NATO's Russia Council of 1997.
However, the NATO leader accused Russia of "a crass breach" of the agreement.
"Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," Rasmussen said.
Documents and statements from the Russian side show that they regard us as opponents.
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced his intention to strengthen NATO ’ s presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be adopted at NATO's summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO's presence in the East as long as necessary," said Rasmussen in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
According to official data, Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
The European Union is still waiting for a decision whether it will also send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the price of gas, Ukraine has not received fuel from Russia for weeks.
Most recently, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger mediated between both sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt gas supply for Europe.
Europe receives about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, most of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks word of power: toll will come "very clearly"
Now the Chancellor is once again clearly committed to this.
But it is not a licence for all complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU against the passenger car toll have been increasingly annoyed by the CSU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a word of power for the introduction of a car toll after continuing opposition from her CDU.
"To make it quite clear: it is in the coalition agreement and it will come," said the party leader on Monday after meetings of the CDU's top governing bodies in Berlin.
But Merkel did not lay down a detailed model for the time being.
In the black and red government program are called "certain parameters".
Federal Minister of Transport Alexander CSU had "made a proposal, and this is now being continued".
The NRW CDU, however, insists on its no to a toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) also made a constructive contribution to the discussions for a bill.
In addition to the topic, he also talked about other ways to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, including broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special about it". Schäuble had left a "Spiegel" report uncommented on Sunday, his house examined its own concept to compensate highway investors with toll receipts - after the election in 2017.
The CSU head of the league, Horst ∑, then warned against developing toll concepts against the lead minister in the cabinet.
CDU vice-president Armin Laschet reaffirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed to toll all district and federal roads," said the Northeast Westphalian CDU chair of the state.
In this respect, it would be an important signal that Netanyahu has now announced that he will once again discuss the issue.
Resistance against the plans also comes from the CDU's regional associations Baden Württemberg and Rhineland Palatinate.
There are fears that tolls affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
He had demanded loyalty from the CDU coalition because of the toll criticism.
The left regards the plans as failure in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks tolls are dead," said Bernd Riexinger, head of the "New Osnabrück Newspaper" (Monday).
"The minister fails with the toll". He wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads, which should start in 2016.
However, domestic car owners may not be additionally burdened according to the agreement.
Therefore, they should receive full compensation for the toll via the motor vehicle tax.
The model, however, must not penalise foreign drivers because of their nationality in accordance with EU law.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought for many years that she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis.
Karin ∑ lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had to live only a few years after she had been diagnosed with another illness.
She actually suffered from Charcot's disease (CMT), a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an insecure gait and curved toes.
Affected people also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
She believed that she was suffering from Friedreich Ataxie (FA), a disease with very poor chances of survival.
∑ thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she would 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, 51 years old today, said, "As a child, I knew I could not do the same as the others.
I fell down constantly and everything lasted longer with me.
I could never ride roller skates or skateboards with the other children and was often teased at school because of my way of walking and walking.
She said that at the age of 13, after several operations to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretch her feet, she saw her medical records when her doctor left the room and read that she suffered from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library, and wrote to the FA's society," she said.
When I got an answer, I was shocked and terribly panic.
I thought that I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and that in between all my skills would slowly lose.
I did all this on my own and planned my own funeral.
She said when she became 17, she realized that her abilities had not decreased as much as she had imagined and questioned her doctor.
He just got up and embraced me and said, "My love, I don't think you have it, otherwise you would already be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests CMT was detected.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness Month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether works as a fireworker since the closure of the former military training site
For almost ten years, no more shots have been shot on the former military training site in Münsingen.
Nevertheless, killing ammunition appears at the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere area every month.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown up locally.
A deafening bang echoes at the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the Münsingen military training site, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6500 hectares area has been the core of the Swabian Alb biosphere area, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated paths.
Tax burden on businessmen in Washington increases with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for businesses in the country rose slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and firms in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia area jointly paid $27.6 billion to state and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to the revenue of 2012 of $26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden of the companies increased last year by 4.3 percent to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after the several years of declining communications in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3%, according to the study conducted by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the District ’ s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland ’ s revenue comes from companies.
Virginia achieves the lowest tax revenue from companies at 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in the property values of companies, say researchers, which led to an increase in property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these profits came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the process also seems to apply to the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 – an increase over the course of a year by 4.2 percent.
But the apparent recovery in real estate assets in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues, as property taxes here amount to just over one-fifth of corporate tax rulings.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland the following happens: a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, managing director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland, for example, is forced to rely much more on income taxes to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Corporate revenues also seem to recover, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes at state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland received $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is heading in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies does not rise evenly in all three places.
The rise rate in the district at 4.3 percent corresponded to the national average, while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported an below average tax of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the markedly lowest corporate income tax (in all three there are firm corporate tax rates) in all three departments.
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district at a relatively high 9.975 percent.
A comparable study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that Virginia requires lower government and local corporate taxes and a better overall tax climate than Maryland.
The District was not investigated in the study.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets next year, this law could reduce the government ’ s corporate income tax rate to 3% by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and they therefore pay more government and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes, which are paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure according to which most small businesses are organized - in the district, Maryland and Virginia rose last year by 20 percent to $2.4 billion, a distinct faster growth rate than corporate taxes overall.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes throughout the country is likely to continue this year, with an increase in general VAT revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2% in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
Yet the Washington area could lag behind if the Federal Government ’ s spending cut had an impact on the region ’ s labour market.
twin city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt ’ s twin city in China now wishes for a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight between the two cities.
German beer brewed in Frankfurt's twin city of Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would settle in our city," said Li Yiwei, Vice President of the Party Secretary of the South Chinese metropolis, this week when a SPD delegation visited his city.
Over and over again, the official of the ruling Chinese Communist Party came back to this concern of the Twelve Million Metropolitan.
Guangzhou, which is also called canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, Li said.
That is why people also had the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The Hessian Social Democratic Party (SPD) chairman Thorsten Schäfer (Gümbel), who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would listen to a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"Beer doesn't need much: good water, cereals and joie de vivre," he added at lunch with the party top in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already radiates Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
Then the official from Guangzhou joined shepherds with shepherds - Gümbel - but with red wine, which was served at the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing art.
Tsingtao is brewed according to the German purity law.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a flight direct connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice President Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but cancelled it in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worthwhile again," the local politician was convinced.
"Business between our two cities continues to grow".
Currently, travelers would have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight connection.
The provincial vice governor, Chen Yunxian, put this desire in the foreground in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," answered shepherd -Gümbel - the Chinese vice minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, nodded in agreement.
Well-groomed partnership
The lieutenant vice president of Guangzhou hopes that he can visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this function.
He came into office only this year after his predecessor had been promoted from office on charges of corruption.
The local leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The action against Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against party and administration corruption, which is harshly enforced by leader Xi Jinping.
The new leader Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top official in Fujian, where the car manufacturer VW built a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially received more than a dozen city twinning agreements.
The connection to the 9000 kilometers away Guangzhou belongs to those that are maintained from both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong with its economic power as the whole of Hesse.
Li reported next year that she wanted to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros.
Family of Joan Rivers "pushes your thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days ago since she was sent to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter was hopeful today that the 81 year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a message today.
We all press our fingers.
According to sources, her mother was sent to the Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency for cardiac arrest in a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors keep them intentionally sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "serious".
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of an overwhelming online support for Donald Trump, Montel Williams, and Kelly Ripa.
Eco-friendly vacuum cleaner and rising wages
In future, stricter environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that are now on sale.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from 1 September, on which the buyer can at a glance recognize central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, sharper nitric oxide values apply in the pollutant class "Euro 6".
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolding builders: They receive a national minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer – and video producer, and a variety of other things – buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because nobody expected to take over Twitch, but because it was widely assumed that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked as if the sale of Twitch to Google ’ s video service was for a cool billion decided thing, and the collaboration also appeared naturally.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their brazil pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games", an insider said.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which better wizards give the (usually older) games a painting of secret science theatres, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch has been somewhat bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It ’ s a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn ’ t come about, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to do sport rather than watch it, it is hard to understand the attraction that assumes to watch others while playing instead of taking the control console in their own hands.
It is one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3 o'clock in the morning, while she creeps through Resident Evil, and something quite different to watch a spinner shoot 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
All these games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego matches, so watching them without your own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast runs, in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete whole games in record time, are entertaining.
But as long as there is not a game or humor virtuoso, its twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It ’ s hard to imagine that Twitch is so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could have just swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who are promoted as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming", and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - swallow - as a spectator sport.
On Saturday there was a lot going on on the bouncy castle at the Burggartenfest.
The concept of the organizers was correct.
Despite the heavy rain on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open air festival in the Burggarten.
At times the entrance had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l light and fun.
From two Spanish words Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
Because the open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten shall radiate brightness in the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes by itself anyway.
This was already apparent on early Saturday, when the first visitors went to open air.
The organizers had promised a celebration for all generations.
And they succeeded.
Around the supply levels on the Burggarten meadow, Salzwedeler, but also guests from the closer and wider surroundings, had made themselves comfortable.
They followed the first live appearances, whirled with their feet in time, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were announced.
And that across the generations.
While some of them were floating on blankets on the extra carved white sand at the beach bar, others were enjoying a quarter of wine in the wine shop, the offspring were raging on the bouncy castle, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But also in the face painting of children, the volunteers had in the truest sense of the word all hands to do, in order to become master of the urge and to conjure imaginative creations into the small faces.
The bigger ones took advantage of the kickertables or participated in a skateboarding workshop, which was organised by the Goodfoot and crew from Salzwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m., he prasselte on the visitors, especially families searched for the width and drying.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not disrupt it.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line".
Therefore, there is nothing against a repetition of the big party next year.
Although the content and size of the event still needs to be worked on, Sem made clear in a first record on Sunday against the referendum.
He described as annoying that the inlet had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously the security company had been booked with too little effort.
The consequence: Some who had already paid did not come to the site anymore.
The resonance was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors, who tumbled in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedeler Hip -Hop -band Blocks' n 'Rox broke off their performance.
The technicians were unable to create a reasonably reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built, because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a tyre breakdown.
"But next year they will be there," said the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula ’ s Open Airs was more than successful.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers made some mistakes, which will be delayed the first time, but have to be eliminated at the second edition.
Even in the social network Facebook the organizers have to file criticism.
"Sorry, but you just expected more for twelve euros", Melanie Meier says on the event page.
"Unfortunately you took a bit of it," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems so closely.
I find it very good that some not only talk stupid, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Hat off! ", writes Stephanie Jenß to the Amula.
Now the organizers have one year to stop these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg ’ s landmark shrinks
As expected, this is not the case.
Rather, the ready component waits to be used in the striking structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the construction of the space observation radar TIRA the shell, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47.5 meters than the old one.
But the size remains world record.
The last step to complete the new cover is the cap swap
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
Afterwards the last quarter of the new shell is placed.
If the weather plays along, the action should go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
Participants in the Ice and Bucket Challenge disarray pine
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain shouted so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This ice bucket contest went painfully beside it.
A woman was hospitalized after she shouted so much at the Ice and Bucket Challenge that she turned the jaw out.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain shouted so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I shouted, and as I did, my jaw just stopped," she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20 year old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn't work, the jaw was hooked, and then I understood that something wasn't right.
My mother and sister also saw this and almost went into the pants with laughter, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was hospitalized to get the jaw back on Tuesday after taking part in the viral trend.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle clubs soon pull again in one strand?
Last time there was a conflict between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereinen.
Now the board members are thinking about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Burg, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, led the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunden Wolfratshausen.
The views on how to deal with the history of Wolfratshauser Burg and a possible reconstruction seemed very different.
The two camps are now moving towards each other: talks on a common approach are to be held soon.
The club directors Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) confirm this on request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit down together", Sjöberg reports.
In his opinion, all members of both clubs could pull together again in the future.
In this way, visible successes can be achieved more quickly.
Whereas the friends of the castle for Richard Dimbath, who died suddenly, had an eye on the reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest until the end, the "opening up and making experience" of the site is at the forefront of the castle club around Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased about the call according to his own information.
Since Dimbath's death he has been standing before his friends.
A new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74 year-old, the club currently has around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first let the club activities rest out of respect." This "thinking phase" was necessary to "think about how it could continue."
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then enter into a conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the Burgfreunde could also make a current mood within their grouping.
There is not yet a candidate for the presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wanted to participate in the project "but very gladly".
The different positions on reconstruction will probably remain in Piffl's eyes in the near future.
He acknowledges Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
Through a high participation of the population as well as by volunteers from all over the world they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I too was skeptical at the beginning.
But over time I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to push the project forward. "It could be created a" unique selling point "for the city of the rafters.
There is nothing else.
In addition, the project could be financed by EU grants, visitors and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction over board for this reason." He hopes that the Burgverein might move a little on this point.
Their aim to first document the story is "important and good".
After that one could see on.
Clever Ways to Save at University Learning Books
Since the cost of university textbooks is more than $1,000 per year for many students, the fast second semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever spariidea.
He invented a loan system for books by students of higher semesters and offered nominal compensation to delay the resale.
"My mathematics book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick -fil -A -Keks," said Schroeder, 19, who attended Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management reported that students spend on average more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials, but that there are various options for cost damping.
Online stores and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Rent textbooks is becoming more popular, so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, announced that renting textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in the college ’ s bookstores last spring semester, said Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are bought in bookstores on campus according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here is the one-off for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost online only a third of the price for which they are available in the campus.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be obtained from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used
If the notes of other or normal traces of usage do not matter to you, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he has spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a second-hand edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was newly sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, Head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors whether previous editions were permissible.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest expenditure.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is a popular alternative for used books.
Rent a car
Rental of textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and you do not want to keep the books after completion of the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for a semester for about $20.
Find out about the terms and conditions of the business in which you rent, including the penalty fees that may apply to writing notes, underscores or traces of use.
Attention: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of conventional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period by wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says students often find the best offers in literature courses, as many classics can be downloaded free of charge nowadays, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Be sure to look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon attend Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for price determination for books, as you can be sure to find the right textbook.
And before placing an online order, one should check, so Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a treasurer
"The Expendables 3" from Sylvester Stallone recorded less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the US, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" recorded only $12 million of its $70 million budget.
The film "Sex Tape", tailored to Cameron Diaz, recorded only $14.6 million on the opening weekend, while children's films such as "Dragon Tames Made Easy 2" also disappoint revenue.
An article by Telegraph ’ s film critic Robbie Collin suggests that in children ’ s films the lack of quality in the films themselves could be the reason.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" so far for children's films and described "Dragon Tames made easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy.
For films for a slightly older target group, however, it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic score for each summer film launch, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and 20 July 2013 and the current year on at least 2000 screens.
The results are based on the opinion of cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that this year ’ s hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that the evolution is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web-streaming for services like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney ’ s upcoming jungle film, told Hollywood Reporter about the website: “I think times are changing. ”
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
Contrary to the current weak cash outcomes of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently posted revenues of $1.2 billion in streaming and almost twice last year ’ s revenue of $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for concentrating too much on comics and prophesied a "meltdown" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic due to the potential cash checkout hits to be expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in the cash outcomes as simply "cyclical" and told Hollywood reporter: "Next summer will be the biggest summer at all at the cinema box office, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
When a few years ago the 2nd table tennis district class was cancelled in order to streamline the League division, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
The consequence: Those who did not ascend have descended.
For example, Göttingen ’ s highest-class team Torpedo avoided the descent in the Bundesliga ’ s relay, but in the coming season it only plays five-class.
Four-class Torpedos ladies remain, despite their grandiose penetration into the Regionalliga.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Bundesliga, as do the boys of the SC Weende.
The SG Lenglers and the Torpedo-Reserve enter the new federation league, in which are no longer represented Göttinger clubs.
In the ladies the TTV Geismar plays in the league, the Torpedo second in the league.
What the composition looks like a better district class is now the new District Superior League South.
Here TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC join.
As regional representatives of Dransfeld and SC Weende, Red and White, Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The regional league of the ladies starts at least in target strength.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are part of the game.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen start in the round.
With nine teams each
The SC Weende sends his girls into the small league.
Also the season of the SCW Boys - there starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded Regionsverband, the two Göttinger Kreisligen start with nine teams each.
In the West Season there are Red White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the East relay play among others Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The ladies are Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the Osterode district, where there are no more women's teams at the county level.
Conspicuous that none of the six 2nd circle classes reaches target strength, here the innovative and energizing district board will have to think about.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the developments on the weekend for us and talked to demonstrators who travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flown out of the Blue Mountains
TWO juvenile bushwalkers were brought to safety with the rope winch after they were caught the night over in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16 year-old girl and the 19 year-old man set off on their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m., when the two had not returned home.
A ruff of addiction from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found at about 11 p.m. near the Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had hurt her knees and the man had fallen and had opened his head.
They stayed overnight with the couple, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were delivered to the Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition with an ambulance.
Anti-government protests in Pakistan escalate
The approximately 1000 demonstrators were pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, said Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid.
After half an hour the transmitter resumed the broadcast.
PTV Director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged equipment in the editorial office.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The demonstrators demand the resignation of the head of government to whom they accuse electoral fraud.
The police announced that about one kilometre away from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, there were again clashes on Monday between around 3,000 demonstrators with security forces.
According to hospital data, a policeman was injured.
At least three people were killed and more than 500 injured on weekends when demonstrators tried to invade Sharif ’ s residence.
They call for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict on Sunday evening, after a meeting in the Army's headquarters, "without wasting time and without using violence."
The communication also said: 'The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state'.
The escalating violence has raised concerns about military intervention, which has already been more frequent in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have lasted since the Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif rejects a resignation.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers to wait on Sunday.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri expressed himself similarly.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the parliamentary election in May last year by fraud.
Qadri demands the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and proclaim new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are deployed to protect the government quarter.
The demonstrators first held peacefully in front of the parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to invade Sharif ’ s residence on the weekend.
Hütteldorfer after second victory of the season in third place of the table.
With the 2: 0 over Grödig a bitter week on Sunday has ended for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate table with the Aus in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The success experience was incredibly important," confirmed Captain and goal-shooter Steffen Hofmann, who came third with Green and White.
With the second victory of the season, Schrammel's dream goal brings Rapid to the winner Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes into the international match with a success experience.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said foreign defender Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory in the 14th minute with his splendid sixteenth round leader Volley.
"I thought that I had all the frustration of Thursday and snapped him under the latte," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel met for the last time in a Bundesliga match on November 13, 2010, it was still for Ried.
Therefore, the first championship match in Rapid's Dress will remain in his special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, I am from the Rapid 'offspring', said Schrammel.
Due to Mario Pavelic ’ s short-term basin, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and did very well there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in a mirror-inverted manner.
He deserves the goal, he has already done some assists this year, "said Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2: 0 by Hofmann after about an hour, which finally brought the decision.
Because before that the guests could also write.
"Thank God we have had some luck today," Schrammel also remarked, referring to the gaps between performance and result in recent weeks: "The results did not vote, but the playful was always good compared to last year".
Barisic even found that "in many games they had been better than today - against" the strongest team that played in this stadium this season ".
The first three points since 26 July therefore proved that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
Not less pleasing for him: "That we finally played back to zero".
The fact that several failures have to be complained with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their debut, makes the victory even more valuable.
"One must not forget this," warned Barisic, who lost in the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately."
The international gaming break must therefore be used to "lick wounds and get a little bit in the physical sphere", Barisic explained, who has five U21 selectors in his ranks.
One to whom the break probably comes particularly situated, is captain Hofmann.
He rips for the team, passes over pain.
Especially in this difficult phase he has shown that he is a very important player for us, "said Barisic.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his change in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350th Bundesliga match, it was the first hit out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4: 2 about the Admira).
Hofmann: "May not believe that everything is good now" "We certainly also had a bit of luck, but at some point the happiness must come back to us.
Now it was high time, "said Hofmann.
He admonished, of course, to concentrate further work: "One must not always see this black and white.
We have not played as badly as this has been shown in recent weeks.
We must not believe, however, that everything is now good.
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team.
It is a very young team that I can help very much at the moment.
They stick to me in certain phases, "said Hofmann.
Val Gardena Coach Michael Baur had little to blame for himself and his team.
He regretted the quick opposite hit "from the category Magic Gate", as well as the regular goal of Nutz in the 40th minute, which had been unjustly discarded by referee collegger.
The only reproach I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough towards goal in some phases.
We have had too little conclusions.
Maximilian Karner looked similar: "It started badly, but then we found pure and even made a goal.
On the whole, there would have been more in it.
Under this peak reigns rest
We showed a mighty tribe in our puzzle task of the summer series "Mein Stück vom Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree-giants still exist in the county, the illustrated specimen is the "Geißruheiche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the 600 year old oak tree.
It goes past coupling, basalt clusters and basalt stone seas.
A bit below the quarry of Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, where it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it protrudes beyond the other trees of the surroundings and reminds with a circumference of more than eight meters of an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive research, there were only references to the name exploration.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has specially consulted the Bischofsheimer Archiv and interviewed older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what it has to do with the Geißruheiche.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Up to about 80 years ago, the goat shepherds were supposed to have driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn onto the laboriously rounded and freed meadows.
At the foot of the tree the animal guardians exhausted from ascent should have rested.
In the meantime the area has regained its meaning, because on the meadows pasture actually again goat herds.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further found out.
When entering the Steinansammlungen one should however exercise caution, because the basalt warmed up by the sun is also a popular abode for Kreuzottern.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Further trails are signposted, which ascend towards Hochrhön and invite to an extended hike.
Where is the Wasserburg?
A water castle, which is sought in our next task, is to be found however rather rarely in height.
The reflection in the trench already gives a good impression of the building, but we have in the county some historical buildings, to which the building counter could fit.
Where is our "piece of Rhöner Glück"?
My Piece Rhöner Glück
As with previous series of the Main and Post in recent years, there are prizes to be won again this year if they have the right solution.
If you like to photograph yourself, you can also participate.
You can send us the solution and also your very personal "piece of the Rhöner Glück" under this keyword under the e-mail address red.neustadt @ main.

After weeks of tug-of-war, Italy ’ s prime minister and EU president Matteo Renzi won the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of the EU ’ s foreign policy against strong conservative resistance at last week ’ s EU Special Summit. She will succeed British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers, as the pro-government daily La Repubblica shows, the appointment of Mogherini, who is also a favourite in the government team, to strengthen the position of Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm down the left party base, which repeatedly revolts against him, because Mogherini is assigned to it - albeit more moderately.
According to the prevailing opinion in Rome, the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Poland nominated as President-in-Office of the Council will be Donald Tusk in order to achieve a political balance.
The EU ’ s chief diplomat will also be Deputy President Juncker.
The remaining approval of the EU Parliament is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica is spreading optimism that the Mogherini, known for its ambition and proven in leading party offices for almost two decades, will meet the "enormous challenges".
The native Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 as a political scientist in the youth organisation of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which merged in 2008 with the Catholic Centre Party Margherita to form the present-day Social-Democratic PD.
In 1999 Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists) for three years.
With the election in 2001 to the party council of the Left Democrats she entered the high party policy, worked in the foreign policy department, whose head she soon became.
She has occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, has been known for her studies of NATO ’ s deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a contingent of troops, and has maintained contacts with Socialists and Democrats in Europe and the US.
She has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies since 2008, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his foreign minister.
If today the PD has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the more than 40 percent of the party ’ s votes in the EU elections in May, Federica Mogherini has a share in it, as is noted in PD.
The allegations in Brussels that the new EU High Representative has too little diplomatic experience, so if there is no substance, the PD counters.
In Brussels, notably Poland and the Baltic States, Mogherini's mistrustfully realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine are being pursued and defamed as a "Russian-friendly course".
It advocates the South Stream pipeline, operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe by bypassing Ukraine, which also serves to secure Italy ’ s energy.
After Renzi took office as EU leader in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at Shake's hands were taken in Brussels with outrage, as well as inviting the Kremlin's chief to a Milan economic summit in October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz and Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an apprentice who has already completed another training in the company.
In the future, the new employees will be employed in four trainees: electronics engineers (three trainees), mechatronics engineers (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All trainees come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new apprentices previously visited primary and secondary schools and secondary schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all vintages as well as the instructors travel to a team training event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn are on the program.
The company has 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 worldwide.
The number of apprentices spread over all vintages is 27.
The socialists in France should "keep their mouths and put France in order," said Francois Hollande's main ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show 'their love' for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reshuffle has met with disapproval by the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay with him," he said with great applause.
As a depressing gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not call into question the controversial 35 hours a week in France, despite strong calls for a relaxation of Emmanuel Macron ’ s new Minister of Economy.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his fellow socialists to "unite" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, threw sand into the gear in which she appeared at a meeting of apostate socialist parliamentarians and criticised the Socialist Party for taking the French "the faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far right leader of the National Front, mocked the socialist ’ s constant trench struggles, saying that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has none, they are forced to form a new government when the old has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will not survive the autumn or winter either," said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated her party ’ s call for a dissolution of Parliament and said that she was confident that she would be victorious in early elections and that she would be ready for government.
France ’ s ruling party suffered a defeat in the local elections in March, and the right-wing National Front was ahead of the EU ’ s May elections.
A poll in the Sunday Journal du Dimanche showed that 76% of the French think that the Socialist Party is at risk of falling into several rival factions before the end of Hollande ’ s term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world ’ s third largest cruise operator, is leading advanced negotiations to acquire Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion market value company, access to Prestige Cruises luxury cruise ships and its wealthy customers, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo refused a comment.
Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry as a whole is about $29 billion and is expected to grow in the coming years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India.
The companies try to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice with the cruise operators.
Prestige Cruises applied for IPO to the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino company under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
At the end of June, Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and TPG Capital LP, the private equity company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise have together 82% of the passenger capacity on American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the IPO of Prestige Cruises.
Per Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A peking-loyal group swung the Chinese flag nearby.
The Standing Committee of the National People ’ s Congress passed a framework law on Sunday that allows only two or three candidates for Hong Kong ’ s 2017 election.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be filled with peking-loyal members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote, and causes pro-democracy activists to perceive their threat and paralyze Hong Kong ’ s financial centre with “Occupy Central ” protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China ’ s party leaders fear that calls for democracy will extend to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper setting out China ’ s dominance over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the Special Administrative Region election process, in which hundreds of thousands marched to the city ’ s business district and organized a sit.
Li ’ s survey is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong Office and Macau State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the day.
Student activists announced that they would meet in front of the Hong Kong leadership office in the afternoon.
Britain did not foresee any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year-old colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin calls on Kiev to start "statehood talks" with eastern Ukraine
According to Russian media reports, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government cease fighting the separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the area of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would be part of Russia, but that his status vis-à-vis Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin ’ s appeal to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro ‑ Russian insurgents, however, fits in with the strategy he has apparently pursued since the beginning of the riots five months ago: helping the separatists to take up territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novorossija de facto independence for an alliance with Russia instead of with the West.
In an interview with the state television channel Eins, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently called the occupied territory "Novorossija" or "Neurussland", a term that recalls the pre-revolutionary splendour of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who hope to be "trapped in their illusions" in the campaign of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on the 26th of October and while government groups attack civilian communities in the areas held by separatists for early peace talks, Itar and Tass reported.
"We must immediately start extensive discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin ’ s reference to statehood had to be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which the Kiev leadership has been discussing for months to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern territories, said Peskov.
It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman ’ s clarification on the correction of Putin ’ s “misinterpretation ” emphasised Russia ’ s claim to leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty in annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from the pre-conflict period gave a broad majority to remain in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats at international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area linking the Russian territory with Crimea.
The peninsula annexed five months ago in the Black Sea is the home port for the majority of the Russian navy as well as an important commercial port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukraine ’ s President Petro Poroshenko, speaking on 7 June at the inauguration address, proposed that Ukrainian legislation, after new elections, should consider additions to the Constitution, which would give the territories greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his notion of autonomy seems to stand in sharp contrast to that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose armament and incitement is accused of Moscow.
Putin ’ s last call on Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders on an equal footing followed a further advance by the rebels last week, after Russian troops and tanks invaded eastern Ukraine over the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia took control of Novoasovsk in the hand, which, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have begun to establish Mariupol, a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants situated between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels on Saturday and urged action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are close to a point where there is no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any concrete action, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andriy Lysenko, Speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, reporting in Kiev on Saturday.
On Sunday, the first 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were included by the Russian invasion of Ilovaysk, were exchanged for 10 Russian paratroopers, who had been captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko announced on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal around Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his anger over hackers, who presumably stole nude pictures of his fiancé Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who of the Hollywood celebrities.
The film city is in excitement after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking scandal about celebrities on the internet.
The responsible hacker probably has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star from "the tribute of Panem" and superstars, among them the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne allegedly also published private photos due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
The noblest, who engaged with Grecko last month, told Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reported to a news website that the hack was "shameful" and that those affected felt "hurt".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which she is up without in a pool.
Palmer's films include "Love is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck and actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comments on the chopped pictures yesterday.
A representative Lawrence 'said to him: "It is an abominable violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "posting hacked pictures from a mobile phone is nothing other than selling Hehlerware."
From a purely legal point of view, the dissemination of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and hikers took part yesterday in the 8th Cycling on the Großer Feldberg and supported the association "Hilfe für krebskranke Kinder".
The tour, which was a torture for some, was a light training for the others.
In one, however, everyone agreed: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski probably slept well last night.
For for the first time in his life the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus drove yesterday by bike to the Feldberg.
For the good purpose.
He can easily put away the little muscle cat, especially since the participation on the 8th wheel on the Großer Feldberg in favor of the association "Hilfe für krebskranke Kinder" (Frankfurt) also brought him a valuable insight.
A great thing.
"I know now that I can - great!"
Small pee on the way in the Applauskurve?
No, if I had stopped, it would have been...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Upper city parliament, many of the 718 participants tormented themselves yesterday in early dew and came close to exhaustion, but happily on the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier to overcome the eleven kilometres long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner for example.
The Green Party politician from the Kreistag - red dress, red bike - made a little understatement at the start ("A lot of professionals, there is arrival the goal!"), turned out to be half a pro on the mountain and went through the finish after 45 minutes without breathing trouble.
He also went through the course in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, press officer of the city of Oberursel, who had set off together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes the "Feldberg" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "Here it is about charity, we like to be part of it - we would have made an exit today anyway", says Kuhn.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had driven down in the morning to Oberursel, and immediately afterwards to the height again.
The Frankfurt Florian Zierz had swung into the saddle at 9 o'clock in the morning, "made" the Feldberg twice, then to roll home with fun.
Also had fun "Fritten Toni".
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg simply belong to it.
He had been aiming for 40 minutes with his 6.5 kilos of road bike.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there ", said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainz says of himself that he is an "ambitious racing cyclist".
He also has to be, because he was on the road with the "Fixie" bike, which are indeed racing bikes, but without gears...
Not only did the 20 hikers, who climbed up over the White Wall and the Fuchstanz to the summit, prove that it was easy to go up without a bike, but also a jogger, who pulled a car tire with weights behind him on a cord.
Bergwacht's doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who provided security with his team, equipped with all-wheelers Bully and Quad, said: "I know" I from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sledge train, only that he pulls the sledge himself. "So the man is in a way his own sledge dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - were sent in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 am.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 o'clock.
Five minutes later the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the "Radeln auf den Großen Feldberg" association, gave the starting commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year he hopes that it will be possible to block the route up to the Feldberg to the safety of the participants.
