The Prague Stock Exchange dropped at the end of the trade
The Prague Stock Exchange has corrected its losses after the fast fall in the morning.
Transactions with the Czech Energy Enterprise (ČEZ) shares account for half of the usual daily trading.
The stock exchange in Prague continued its fall on Monday from the beginning of the trade on Tuesday, when it dropped by six percent.
This time, the Wall Street shares are behind the fall.
We also see the market’s reaction to the result of the U.S. House’s vote that rejected support for the stabilization plan of the financial sector there.
The fall of shares in Asia
The Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indicators eventually deleted some of the losses over the day.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng stock index dropped almost four percent during the course of trading, but later deleted some of the losses and reduced the drop to approximately 2.5 percent.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which follows Chinese shares, dropped 3.8 percent, while Shanghai’s markets closed.
The Sydney Stock Exchange shares lost more than five percent, but eventually the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the index, fell 3.6 percent.
“The time of the U.S. rescue action is uncertain and affects the world’s financial markets,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, its financial policy is determined independently, i.e. independently from the Chinese central bank.
In Hong Kong, the interest rates are at the same level as in the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said the U.S. lawmakers should immediately resume negotiations and accept the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens other countries to feel the consequences of this.
The Blood Bath of American Shares
The House of Representatives of the United States on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, which had to be invested $700 billion (approximately $12 trillion).
Thus, the legislators ignored the call of President George Bush to support the plan.
Bush said the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. shares suffered a bloodshed and the leading stock index recorded the highest fall in 20 years.
Dow Jones dropped by almost 7 percent, the last time it had a similar drop in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but as it turned out that the proposal was not accepted in the House of Representatives, the index began to freeze.
Congress: US government can pump $700 billion into banks
The U.S. Congress’ heads and President George W. Bush’s government agreed on the broader form of the agreement and on the financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
This will be voted at the beginning of next week.
The U.S. lawmakers have reached a breakthrough in negotiations on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the U.S. financial system in the amount of $700 billion (approximately $12 trillion).
There is no victory yet.
The Congress must conclude some details of the agreement before the final form of the law and their vote can be revealed.
The proposal for the financial system will be discussed in the House on Monday.
This was by Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Organizations Committee.
Senate sources say the proposal may be voted on Wednesday.
Economists say there should be an announcement that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor in the recovery of the financial markets.
Due to the complexity of the mechanisms, however, there is a "disclosure" after that.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We made a big step.
We have resolved our different views on what the form of a package to stabilize the market should be,” said Democrat Nancy Pelosi to Bloomberg.
The final vote may be held on Sunday.
The lawmakers met with U.S. Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson on Saturday night to give a final form to the government base.
This should acquire unfor-selling hypoactive from financial companies, which puts financial companies in serious losses and threatens the stability of the entire system.
“We are close to the final agreement on a project that will work and that must be effective on the market at the same time.
The repair plan has to continue, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets that are drastically falling.
The Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, said the lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress on Sunday.
In fact, they want to calm investors before trading on the Asian monetary markets, where the time zone could have the first impact on Monday trading by Congress.
However, it is not yet clear when the two chambers of the U.S. Congress will vote on the law, as well as whether the trial will not be held at the last moment because of any problem.
The lawmakers hope that the law will be approved in the coming days.
However, the law is undergoing a number of changes.
The total amount intended to support the system shall be divided into two parts.
According to President George Bush’s request, the first $350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, the Congress could block the release of the remaining amount, which was set to be additional $100 billion and later $350 billion, if it feels that the program does not fulfill its function.
Bush assessed progress in negotiations
Although the President may revoke this decision, Congress may revoke its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program remained, which was the acquisition of material assets for the purchase of bad mortgage securities that lost their value, since hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to refund their mortgage credits.
“We have all developed.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
U.S. President Bush is satisfied with the progress made in the negotiations.
Tony Fratto, Bush's spokesman, said that the president was satisfied with the progress on Saturday and appreciated the "double-party efforts made to stabilize our financial markets and defend our economy."
Restrictions on buses
The negotiations led Christopher Dodd, Chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility for the financial program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of discounts, and the timing of the funding plan.
The new law also restricts the so-called bus-finished satisfactions of the directors participating in the program, and establishes a supervisory committee for the fund.
The fund should be governed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve been working very hard on this and we’ve made great progress towards a deal that will work and will be useful to all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also accounts for the assistance provided to the household owners who have trouble with the refund.
The government should create new reimbursement assets for its purchased mortgages, with the aim of reducing debtors’ monthly reimbursement assets and allowing them to maintain their homes.
Tagged: spiritual help
The proposed project, according to David Marek, the leading economist at Patria Finance, is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"It's all because it's not possible to know what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive to how the financial sector and the government will divide the losses between each other,” said Marek to iHNed.cz website this week.
It is not so important that the plan is approved now or early next week.
“It is much more important that Congress decides this week that the plan will be supported and blessed as soon as possible.
The spiritual importance of creating an agreement on the approval of the plan is the most important thing at this moment,” Marek emphasized.
MP3 player vs mobile player.
We help you to choose
While almost every mobile is able to play MP3 files, no MP3 player can be called.
It seems clear that it is better to buy a phone.
However, there are many reasons for a person to get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
You’ll probably find it hard to get a high-quality expensive disc player home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc disc.
On the one hand, such music products do not appear on backet disks, but there is no objective reason for this from a quality point of view.
However, if your plots are full of art rock, jazz or blues backet discs, you’re probably dreaming of such a record player.
This is similarly designed for travel, i.e. compressed - simplified with MP3 music.
There are price and quality categories.
It may be unacceptable for some to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, as a Pink Floyd fan is likely to find it hard to accept a twentieth crown market headphone.
There are two extremes between which everyone has enough space.
The choice is wide.
The life of the elements is also important.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than simply play music, but also what most mobile devices do not even accidentally.
No device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary features, calling and sending SMS, you can play music and video, take both, have a better or worse camera, and even navigate.
And if we take into account smartphones and communicators, you will also have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a little miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can photograph.
Many mobile phones have disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile, the more times the display sends to the charger.
Music is one of the greatest energy sources.
Few mobile devices can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, mostly much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more performing.
For cheap mobile phones, therefore, count that they will not play for you for more than a few hours.
If you even call here and there, get a charger to your workplace for the sake of safety - this also applies to more expensive devices.
MP3 players will not have such a problem, even the worse will be able to operate at least 9 hours continuously with one charging.
The next problem arises when you upload music to your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector and, in addition, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers can cope with the miniature memory cards that are used on mobile devices without an adapter.
Players, with some exceptions (iPod), do not need any special software.
It is enough to load the device with music from the computer via USB.
Most mobile and player are already creating a music library that is ordered by the artist, the album, the genre, or, for example, the user’s assessment.
Some devices only depict structures like Windows Explorer, and some know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to manage, mobile devices know more
When choosing the specific equipment, you should be primarily concerned about the battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output, and of course the convenience of handling.
If music serves you primarily as a background and you only listen to it for a short time a day, for example on the radio, any MP3 player mobile is suitable for you.
This can be done by any mobile phone.
You don’t even need to pay special attention to what music formats the mobile or player can.
MP3 is all over and the decisive majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
MP3 is one of the most popular and, in addition, the vast majority of the devices deal with music in the WMA format.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPod) is less common.
Better mobile devices also enable, for example, online music purchases.
It is enough to visit the corresponding pages of the provider (or other provider) via the mobile internet and buy the song or album.
This service can already in itself be a pressing argument for the purchase of music mobile.
Unfortunately, the supply of the providers is cloudy and is generally limited to only one-summer radio broadcasters.
The prices are not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that just such a way of selling music (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people keep their mobile devices on their own.
Whenever he wants to hear something, he holds his cell phone in his pocket while the forgotten MP3 player hever at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry the headsets or at least the soundtracks with you.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker, which has almost every mobile, but only a few MP3 players.
For many, the biggest advantage of music mobile will probably be the price.
The cheapest is usually less than three thousand crowns.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can get a fair walkmant.
However, most of the time you are limited by the lack of the output of the traditional headphone.
The best and most technically equipped phones with the traditional 3.5mm diameter hole ear headsets can cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players is, however, among other things, the easy handling.
The easiest - not necessarily the cheapest players (see our selection) is really everyone to deal with.
Minimum function, the usability compared to the previously usual cassette magnet or gramofon is obvious.
It is not threatened to collapse in the form of the randomly enabled mobile internet, and not even for the following huge account for data transfer.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) are usually open to exchangable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
If you purchase the right card, you can get a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
But be cautious.
Basic types support only cards with maximum capacity of up to 2GB.
Only the most expensive can know what to start with up to 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and even want to buy a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or irivert.
Based on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) you do not need to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you belong to the more demanding students, choose special mobile walkmen (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, the convenience of handling thus approaches the MP3 player.
The most distant in the industry is Sony Ericsson, which has the same user interface for its walkman series mobile phones as the separate MP3 players.
MP3 players of the above-mentioned brands can offer the same service in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual provider will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced and our service providers offer practically the same services as their Western European partners.
Nevertheless, something is missing here for us - a virtual provider that forces classic providers to significant price decrease.
Maybe it will not be so for a long time.
On the Mobil.cz website we have repeatedly written that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This is also confirmed by the Czech Republic, which pointed out that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in other EU countries.
Following the European Commission’s latest step in regulating roaming fees, this may result in a controversial situation – SMS from abroad to some Czech mobile service providers will be cheaper than domestic.
How is it possible that the prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of a competition that really wants to go into struggle.
This may sound contradictory because we have three mobile networks and our penetration is above 100%.
Mobile service providers, on the contrary, are pleased to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvořák, the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office, has repeatedly stated that there is no room for new service providers in the Czech Republic.
Per it is true that a classic provider with its own network probably no longer has too many chances (although it is likely to have a difficult time to find frequency).
However, there is another option - the virtual provider.
The entry of virtual service providers to the mobile market led to a significant decline in prices, which the classic service providers had to respond to.
In the meantime, even before big fish entered the market, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile in the UK, sounds similar to us were heard.
However, it has been proven that such providers have their place and can really be successful.
For example, we don’t have to go too far.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the Mobilking virtual service provider in Poland.
This service provider has achieved more than 100,000 customers in just a half year and has become the fifth largest service provider there.
Meanwhile, behind Mobilking is the Penta Financial Group, which in the Czech Republic is the owner of the U:fon.
The advantage of virtual providers is the possibility of focusing on a much closer target group.
For efficient operations, it requires much less customers than the traditional service provider.
It does not result in relatively high cost of construction, operating and maintenance of mobile networks.
Virtual providers in the world, therefore, usually appear to be low-cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which, however, are often compensated with less service.
For example, the UK Tesco Mobile offers at least 50 percent cheaper SMS messages than its competitors.
But, as the example of the Polish Mobilking shows, a very good pull can also be booked on a target group.
This service is specifically focused on men.
"Real men choose the Mobilking provider - who they like, who they can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobil Entertainment Company, which operates this virtual provider.
It’s hard to say if a similar idea in Poland can succeed in us.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický claims: “The Czech market is relatively small to the segment approach on which the majority of virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfied with the supply of services.”
Mobile service providers are unlikely in the Czech Republic
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a kind of virtual provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about a successful expansion of this project, but negotiations in the Czech Republic don’t seem too hopeful.
The launch of Mobilking will rather take place in other countries in our region,” said Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for the Penta Financial Group, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
It indirectly confirmed that the existing mobile service providers in the Czech Republic are not excessively sympathetic with this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do their best to ensure that there is no potential competition.
The GTS Novera group has long not hidden its interest in the launch of a virtual provider, which thus intends to take a further step to make Telefonica O2 a real competitor in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in providing our customers with not only wireless, but also mobile telecommunications services.
The more quickly, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile service providers.
Some of them have already succeeded in the negotiations,” says Pavel Kaidl, a spokesman for the group.
Maybe better times are coming.
Unformal information shows that the first virtual provider may be lucky until the end of the year.
However, his birth is still surrounded by a wall of unbeatable silence.
“At this point, we don’t think that a full-value virtual provider would have a place on the Czech market.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very special.
Until now, we have not been called by a single subject that offers a complex and serious project in this area,” said Vlastimil Sršeň from the Television 02 press class.
The specific situation of the Czech market is also referred to by other providers.
Martina Kemrová, spokeswoman for T-Mobile, expressly agrees with O2, adds: “We have not yet recorded any viable and bilateral profitable business project that could be further based on.”
And he added: "In the T-Mobile network, it is unlikely that any virtual provider will appear by the end of the year.
At this point, there should be a concrete agreement on our table, so that we can think in such a short term."
Vodafone is more concerned about compliance with its own 3G license requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, primarily in the field of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is what we think is the most expensive for our customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this field is partnering to build shared networks for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible offices - a crowd with service providers
The process of mobile service providers is easy to understand, the entry of a new service provider would result in increased competition, decreasing prices and thus decreasing their profits.
So why should we make it easier to enter such a competition?
When something is important to the providers, they are able to cooperate, it also witnesses the line around the birth of the U:fon.
The greatest pressure on ČTÚ was probably about the birth of the T-Mobile company’s U:fon.
This is confirmed by the publicly available information on the website.
But now the U:fon comes well as a reason why we do not allow the entrance of the virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová added: “The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been impacted by the entry of the fourth mobile service provider on the market.
Having regard to the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player’s entry into the market and its services would have high demands.”
However, having regard to this attitude of mobile service providers, the total disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is quite surprising.
Meanwhile, it’s not just the attitude of the Czech Republic, which unfortunately – unlike the UK and other developed countries – has no right to interfere with economic competition.
This is only the competition authority.
However, the office is characteristically concerned with the whole problem.
“Virtual service provider’s entry into the mobile market would be possible only after a contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider was signed for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such agreement has been concluded, as the offer of potential stakeholders is likely not relevant to traditional service providers," said Kristián Chlapua, the Department of External Relations of the Economic Competition Office, in response to our question.
A statement from the representatives of the service providers will probably not surprise anyone.
However, from the office, which should represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, ensure that no one can recover from its market position, this is more than strange.
Specifically, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "In abroad, where virtual service providers normally operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to the price of mobile phone services."
However, it is unlikely that the pressure towards the proper functioning of the market environment and the price decrease is not within the interests of the new OECD.
In this case, it is truly shocking that the perfect consistency from the reactions of the three mobile service providers.
The question of whether it is only a coincidence is almost self-understood.
As in charging stations, the exactly identical gasoline prices are only works of coincidence and harsh competition.
“The Office has not revealed signs of an anti-competitive proceedings in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
No service provider has a leading position, i.e. it has no proportionally greater responsibility for its market performance.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual service providers are likely to be missing by the telecommunications regulator,” Chalupa said.
The presentation of market leadership is one of the many points of dispute.
Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, based on which telecommunications are the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
Of course, there is no Czech provider in such a market.
However, some legal experts also offer a different viewpoint - the creation of a virtual provider always requires the approval of the network operator.
And the mobile provider - relatively logically - has a monopoly on its own network.
Therefore, in a certain segment it is necessarily dominant.
But even if we would not accept this argument, it should be a minimum incentive for UOHS that three mobile service providers do seemingly similarly.
Meanwhile, the complaints of a number of stakeholders (including the already mentioned GTS Novera company) show that they are facing very similar obstacles during negotiations with all service providers.
The transfer of responsibility to ČTÚ is a relatively usual trick in telecommunications, with which the UOHS takes his hand away from the whole matter.
We have seen it in some similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the newly adopted telecommunications law, the extension of the powers of ČTÚ in the field of economic competition in telecommunications was not achieved, although many experts hoped that the situation would improve.
The representatives of the new OHS should know this well, but they probably have other interests.
It works when no one is listening.
Meanwhile, it remains unnoticed the functioning of some kind of false-virtual providers, many of which are already operating in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies issuing their own mobile service pricing lists, which, however, are only partially public.
It is a multilevel marketing company.
Thus, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Pricing lists of these companies are usually only available to the selected.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts against the provider as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a priority customer, you will receive special price offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile service providers prohibit similar pre-requisits.
“If there were cases we’re talking about, it could be a contract breach that we’d deal with and which could lead to the end of cooperation with that company,” Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this issue.
But it is quite unlikely that the news of such activity would not have reached the people responsible for the mobile service providers.
In particular, the three companies may be thousands of customers.
At the same time, no service provider will defend against such a procedure.
In fact, these companies have no negligible profits from their activities, and at the same time, unlike real virtual providers, they are not threatened by their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns of possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, however, the services of these companies are used by only an overwhelming percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not listed in their name, so they cannot have it fully as the general customers of the mobile service providers.”
But this is exactly what I think should be strange at least.
In addition, another question is also raised to the U.S.
If mobile service providers are looking at a similar procedure, why do they prevent the birth of a virtual service provider?
It should be added that the UOHS has a relatively strong authority to reveal such activity, and if it does not want it, it does not have to be satisfied with the service providers' explanation that they did not think of anything like that and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we’re not the most expensive
As mentioned several times in the text, the entrance of virtual service providers to the mobile market has led to a noticeable decline in the prices of services.
Meanwhile, in virtually every country where virtual service providers were established, classical service providers tried to prevent their establishment more or less.
The arguments they used were practically the same - too small, too satisfied market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the developed countries, however, regulatory bodies have intervened in these moments, which in no way defended the interests of mobile service providers, but of their customers.
Then, even with formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual provider that others followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies give the whole case to each other.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that unclear competencies are good for them in these cases.
But don’t give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider will really appear soon, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If a service provider would allow the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, the UOHS may only find it difficult to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may not be more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four processing of the new version of the Czech State Hymn.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek on the Day of the Czech State feastly presented the new recordings of the state hymn Where is my country?
The hymn was recorded by the National Theatre band under the leadership of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female speeches, singers or instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka sing.
The song was modified by Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can read all four versions on the iHNed.cz website.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
He has previously told the Czech Radio that he intentionally selected young representative singers that are expressive and popular to half the speaking variations.
“From the beginning in both of them, and later in the orchestra, I’ve been trying to take care of clean diction, the text’s well-comprehensibility and consistency,” he said.
The Czech National Anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where Is My Country? was first silent in the Rendi Theatre in 1834 in the piece by Josef Kajetán Tyl Fidlovačka, supplemented with the song by František Škroup.
It became popular and people were spontaneously regarded as their own.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the state hymn after the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
After the establishment of the independent Czech Republic, one of the seven state symbols remained.
What is the “new” hymn?
Prague transportation company will deliver chip cards for the first time on Wednesday
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the first passenger to enter the metro, railways and buses will be registered as the date on which the first passenger to enter the metro, railways and buses will be registered as the first passenger to enter the metro, railways and buses, and the first passenger to enter the metro will be registered as the first passenger to enter the metro.
The coupon is currently available to approximately a hundred thousand people who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase 30 days and 90 days, as well as annual coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time save on their chip cards at the Transportation Company’s information centers and destinations at the Museum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
Coupons can be purchased on the Internet via the Transport Company’s website www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 customers until the afternoon.
Those who are starting to use the internet trading can endlessly forget the output windows of the metro stations, where they have had to regularly cross long lines for line tickets.
The coupon can be purchased via the internet and stored on the Opencard card in one of the 13 accounts of the City Library.
“These places are available to passengers with a board of trained servers that will help those interested in online shopping and save their purchased coupon on their card,” said Martin Opatrný, project spokesman.
In addition to the libraries, electronic kupons will be saved on Opencard in some self-service automates equipped in the prechargers.
How do these automates look?
They are red, they remind the ticket managers, and the passengers may have noticed them at Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florence and Vltavská metro stations.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but it should be eight by the end of the year," Opatrný added.
The driver is automatically checked instead of the driver.
Managing automates starting tomorrow is easy.
It is only enough to insert the Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon will be saved by itself.
Electronic kupons will be valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
So on the train and bus lines around the city from 300 to 499 with which mainly the inhabitants of the Central Czech trips travel to the capital.
"On trains listed in integrated transport in Prague, the trains were shifted with card readers, which help to determine the zone validity of the coupon," explained Filip Drápal from the organization Ropid, which prepares the public transport schedule in Prague.
In the buses around the city, the card readers are installed at the driver’s wallet.
Therefore, when entering, the driver must not only show the chip card, but also place the Opencard on a specified place on the wallet side.
The driver will check the validity of the tickets.
“For example, if the passenger needs to check the validity of the coupon, it’s the easiest to ask the driver for this,” Drápal added.
Passengers who travel by non-city buses and don’t remember when their coupon is valid can go back to self-service machines that save the coupon on cards.
Information about the validity of their documents is displayed here on the display of the equipment.
Sudanese voters want referendum from the US
The Sudanese Germans in 1945 requested the accession of Šumava to the United States.
This is revealed from the letter in the collection of the Scientific Library in Southern Czech Republic.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States.
It is said that this desire was made in 1945 by some groups of Sudanese Germans to the US President.
This is also revealed from a remaining letter from a private archive, which is currently kept in the collection of the Scientific Library in Southern Czech Republic.
The Germans of Czechi Krumlov in the letter asks the U.S. President not to allow the "Shumava County" to be returned to the Czech Republic, which Hitler has already accepted under the Treaty of Munich.
"We have interpreted the situation correctly and we really want to be sure in the words that the U.S. troops come to the German territory in no way as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter is signed with the words "People who carry the fate of Šumava in their hearts."
Since attachment to Czechoslovakia may only give the supposedly Sudanese Germans — with the knowledge of the national character of the Czech Republic — hope for brutality, misunderstanding, non-comprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter call on the U.S. President to take over the protectorate of Šumava "now and forever".
“We can’t believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million inhabitants, this territory would be considered a foreign country for us, which suppresses and suppresses the minority, and in no way would contribute to the victory of the allies,” the letter said.
The reason why the authors couldn’t sign is the alleged fear of the revenge of the “Czech oppressors”.
So if the President of the United States allegedly doubts about the views of the Schumacher Germans, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the Schumacher County on whether his inhabitants want to become part of the United States and whether they want to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter, in addition to the current knowledge of post-war history, may seem somewhat naive, some historians say it correctly depicts the expectations of the Sudet Germans at the time.
Even though the Czech Germans had to minimise the idea that they would be displaced from the country, only few of them recognized the possibility of this.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to agree on a kind of autonomy for the Sudets.
Some of them said they would just stay in the Czech Republic.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in České Budějovic.
During the war, Chalupa served as a German in the Navy in the Baltic Sea.
When the British were captured at the end of the war and placed in the Holštynsko prison camp, dozens of other Czech Germans came to teach them Czech.
“They trusted that when they came home, the Czech language would be good for them,” Chalupa said.
No one of the German prisoners who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war said they would be displaced from the country under the Beneš decrees.
You don’t think – you pay.
Emotional campaigns attack leaders
In Czech history, it is the most expensive road safety action.
This would also be the characteristic of the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport will launch on Wednesday.
The ministry office of Aleš Řebíček hopes of this campaign to distract the leaders from the dangerous behavior behind the government.
The $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, and on the internet, but also on broadcasts.
Managers should be alerted about speed drive and alcohol.
And you should also remind them that they should switch their security bands before they start.
He wants to address the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not least professional drivers.
What appears in the advertisements?
These are emotional stories, primarily human.
This is the “blood” slogan of the entire campaign:
You don’t think – you pay.
The term "you don't think" is written in large letters on the order number.
The word “pay” is written in the word “pay”.
This should symbolize that a person can pay for a moment of negligence with his life.
Advertisers will be scared by the advertising points until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where drastic images of victims of accidents can be viewed regularly.
It hopes that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech roads.
The advertising points are made by the Euro RSCG agency.
Take it to the drivers.
For drivers, the system ‘take it, take it’ is valid.
For them, it’s when, for example, they go through the red, thus saving time.
The 'treat' is the danger of punishment or accident.
The driver should be reminded of the risk,” says Martin Kořán, a traffic psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And therefore, it is necessary for the information campaign in the press, primarily for the negative campaign, the psychologist thinks.
He said the driver's attention to the threat tables are less effective.
"If the danger warning board is equipped, it is likely to soon fit into the environment and the managers will not deal with it," Kořán warned.
Olmer would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmer, the president of the temporary Israeli government, spoke about the return of almost all the territories occupied in 1967, i.e. the western coast of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Highlands, in exchange for peace with Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview published on Monday by Jediot Achron.
“We have to agree with the Palestinians, which means that we have to return almost all, if not all, territories,” Olmer told the newspaper.
“We will retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we must give Palestinians the same percentage of Israel’s territories, because without them there will be no peace,” he added.
He acknowledged that the possible return would include Eastern Jerusalem.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and first of all wants that tractors and bulldosers don't go through his feet, as one of my best friends happened, he must give up a portion of Jerusalem," Olmert noted referring to the two cities in July, where a few people were killed and a few dozen were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution to the temple mountain, sacred and historical places" in the Old Town.
“Whoever wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the whole city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he emphasized.
Exit from the Golan Highlands
Olmert also expressed his opinion on the withdrawal of the Israelis from the Golan mountains, which he believes is an indispensable condition for a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would require some effort from Damascus.
“I do not suggest a peace treaty with Syria based solely on the withdrawal from the Golan,” he warned.
“The Syrians know what they need to give up to get Golan.
They must give up their current ties with Iran; they must give up their ties with Hezbollah (Shiit movement); they must give up the regular support that Hamas (Shiit movement), Al-Qaeda and Jihad (Saint War) terrorism in Iraq," he said.
Next Next post: Are passengers in buses illegal?
The law does not recognize them, it is not permissible to travel in a distance bus.
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company, the question arose near Padova, Italy, whether passengers and passengers can travel in the bus while traveling.
"If we want to comply with the law strictly and formally, the accompanying activity is contrary to the law on transportation," said Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The death of a 22-year-old passenger last week was probably caused by a truck driver who crossed the bus route.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver at the least secure place in the bus, although she had two more seats.
The bus may collide or suddenly brake even at the moment when the passenger serves coffee or offers a newspaper.
It has a role to determine whether the bus has a standing place under the traffic permit.
If there is no homologation in the bus, passengers must sit.
The distance buses of the Student Agency do not have stations; which is also confirmed by Radim Jančura, CEO of the company at Aktuálně.cz.
“We tried to find a solution with this ministry, and at first passengers were not allowed to move.
However, this was withdrawn and we found that passengers could go to the toilet while on the road if they had their own seats,” he said.
The law does not recognize the passenger.
"There is no clear legal regulation on the role of the passenger - no legislation regulates this position.
However, no law prohibits the service provider.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of the passenger; it does not define his rights and obligations," adds less clearly spokesman Hanzelka.
Josef Pokorný, the Director of the Road Vehicle Operation Department of the Ministry of Transport, on the contrary, believes that the law addresses the problem properly.
It depends on whether there is a parking place in the bus’s traffic permit.
And that ends,” he says.
Buses may be urban, where there are stations and the maximum speed is limited, and with stations between the city and the highest speed permitted, and distances without stations and with the highest speed permitted, with seats with safety bands.
As on the plane, the expert says.
Jaroslav Hořín, a transport safety expert at BESIP, does not see a major problem in the movement of passengers on board the bus.
“Through the continued progress, there are not many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on the aircraft.
It’s not sure when there’s turbulence and the passenger will be able to hit his head.”
"But if the bus suddenly brakes, of course its physical laws apply.
Just as in city buses or railways.
The safety of passengers must be resolved by the carrier by internal rules," he says and also believes that the problem has not been solved in terms of law.
Jančura is ready to eliminate services
The Student Agency offers passenger services as the only bus carrier.
There are 200 passengers.
The manager does not consider their occupation risky after the accident.
"But as I have the impression that the occupation of the passengers is risky, I will stop it.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by passengers at the time of departure.
This would also be a cost savings,” he says.
He justified the absence of passengers in his vehicles with security interests by Alexey Litvin, the director of Asiana, who operates a fraction of flights compared to the Student Agency.
“We don’t have any passengers, we’re opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later it ends with some lethal injury," he told Týden.cz just a year ago.
An incredible tragedy happened.
A two-year-old passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger passenger.
The Slovene truck probably turned out of the stop band without using a direction indicator and stopped the bus route.
The bus driver suddenly attempted to escape with a maneuver, but the right front of the bus hit him.
The fact that two reserved places for passengers' rest were sold, Jančura rejects.
“These places on distant flights cannot be booked, they are blocked.”
The company wants to prosecute the driver of the truck.
With compensation for the girl's family, the agency does not wait for the court's judgment, but also expects financial compensation from the defendant.
amendments to law?
In the Far Future
The clarification of the movement of passengers on board the bus could be the amendment of the law, on which a group of 30 experts of the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year.
“The group did not any specific results.
The buses are not so much, rather the point system deals with the highway at the maximum permitted speed and mobile use during driving,” says expert Hořín.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of passengers as something that would fundamentally threaten the safety of passengers,” concludes Hanzelka, a spokesman, saying that the safety of buses is under the authority of the police and labor agencies.
The hopes of Düsseldorf pass through Frankfurt
The letter written by the WestLB board to the staff of the bank is not shrinking in the big words.
The unity of the financial institution in Düsseldorf and the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt could form "the central capital market organization of the savings financial group" - writes the letter published Monday.
WestLB will introduce a permanently profitable "competence block" into such a business.
Such a connection could give a decisive blow to further convergences in the provincial banking sector.
This is a reading of when a management wants to prove its ability to act in difficult times.
The uncertain WestLB bank is still under heavy pressure.
Not only the EU Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervision Authority, which has recently informed the Northern Rhine-Westphalia Provincial Government that it is shrinking the deadline for finding a lasting solution.
For savings customers, however, between Deka-Bank and WestLB, which is famous for its investment funds, it has long been a topic of a kind of connection - also from the Frankfurt part.
By the end of August, Deka-Bank’s chairman, Franz Waas, told the six-year data that the bank located on Mainzer Landstraße and a provincial bank, such as Helaba or WestLB’s fusion did not see any meaning.
Nevertheless, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is one-half representative of provincial banks and the other-half representative of savings associations, has commissioned the Board to negotiate with the WestLB on joint business activities.
In this context, the capital market business or certain parts of it may be discussed.
However, negotiations, according to financial circles, have just begun.
The name Deka-Bank, one of the most important employers in the financial sector in Frankfurt with its 3,000 employees, is not the first to come up with the consolidation of the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a moment that the Deka-Bank united with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, there was nothing out of the Third Alliance.
The plans were hardly revealed, and the Hessen province government spoke against the interests of Helaba.
The other two banks did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was transferred to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, the idea of the relationship between the Deka-Bank and the provincial banks has repeatedly emerged.
But recently, the head of Helaba, Günther Merl, spoke against the plans for associations with her bank.
However, it is recognized that it is necessary to approach the various banks in the middle sector.
Now, after the provincial assembly elections in Bavaria, BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg are expected to be the first to relate.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, the potential partners may slowly disappear.
In South Germany it could only be a younger business partner, although the financial crisis has so far been significantly more affected than the Munich and Stuttgart banks.
The fusion with WestLB was excluded by the Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which has a 85% share in Helaba, earlier this year.
If not, the NordLB will remain.
However, such geostrategic considerations represent only one side of the profit.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of each bank match each other.
Merl said in June that the German Savings and Fat Alliance has not yet answered the decisive question of what business model to ensure the future of provincial banks.
Finally, it is possible that WestLB will be destroyed, but that is obviously not desired there.
According to the statement of the Board of Directors, they are seeking a “full solution”.
How this can be combined with the unification of individual units with the Deka-Bank is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of the Oktoberfest is known as the "Italy Weekend"
This is the first time for Elena and the third or fourth time for Luc.
Now, however, Elena is here as her girlfriend, and so everything is completely different, Luca says.
Behind them, next to the Kaiser brand’s five-litre bar, a strong body-wrapped man stands and proves to about 200 people traveling to the Oktoberfestre how deep sounds they can get out of their throat.
Elena first kisses Luca’s face, then kisses her.
They arrived in Verona from Bologna.
From here, four buses depart from the bus parking near Puorta Nuova station at 23.45 p.m. with the destination "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrival is expected at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are mainly for the Italians, the fourth only for the Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans had already chanted their flag, and the celebration began during the night.
And so loud that it is not for the Italians, says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, wearing a long, instrumental jacket and a wide, silver wire glass.
It has been on the Oktoberfest for five years, but this year it has only organized three routes.
The night there, during the day on the Oktoberfest, at 22.30 pm home.
The accommodation would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, which includes the welcome Kaiser beer cooked in accordance with the Bavarian beer purity law, the accident insurance and the German-speaking tour guide as well - a German-speaking course held in Marco Frankfurt.
And they are already put into the buses in the night on the highway toward "Brennero".
There is no beer, there is no beer.
The bus is still and the passengers are sleeping.
It’s okay, they’ll still need their strength.
They take a break in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where on the 8th highway many Italian buses even take a short break before Munich.
When Marco’s group arrives at half a week in the parking lot near Theresienwiese, 50 other buses are already on board from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco even holds a final information, describes the military plan.
Everyone should wear the yellow hat.
On the left side of this is the inscription "Oktoberfest" written with fracturic letters, along with the web address of Marco's travel office: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, “When the bridges of the beer store are opened, run,” Marco screams in the morning.
Running and occupying places on the back of the tent.
“Do not go ahead, for we will stop, and not every yellow hat will sit on the same boards, but let us disperse in the tent.”
The single-layer crocodile costs 8.25 euros, says Marco.
And not to forget the wine.
“Tell the security guards that they’ve behaved well.
When you leave your places, they will be occupied.”
Thirdly, “Be here again at half a half this evening.”
And now we go to Wiesn.
On the way, one man binds yellow socks on the trees, on the tables, and even on the electoral poster of one of the major Bavarian People's Party.
We need to be prepared for the withdrawal.
This is the second weekend of the Oktoberfest, known as the "Italy Weekend".
There are no accurate numbers; they are talking about 50 thousand people who cross the Alps swallowed in the beer stores, 10 percent of all visitors in the weekend are allegedly coming from Italy.
The police in Munich is strengthened by seven South Tyrol policemen, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross, which in its national statistics, with about 200 medical care, the Italians occupy the first place, ahead of the Austrians (about 80) and throwing down to the lowest degree British (about 60).
It is popular among the Italians for the Hofbräu beer.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, emphasized Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
Even fortune that the politician used the word "relatively" and, to say, even insisted that the German banking sector is not preserved by the crisis.
This happened this weekend.
Daxon listed Munich's Hypo Real Estate (HRE) real estate funding company has received a billion loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulences.
A person who was aware of the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loans will rise to €35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate must pay interest only after the part used.
The money is partly from private and partly from public banks.
In the background there are losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
Depfa, the state-funding company, said in a newspaper that it had borrowed money for long-term projects and refinanced itself for an extremely short term, which is no longer possible because of the uncertainty that dominates the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash stock dropped by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and its own capital was moderate, from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Current revenue and net revenue from cash transactions fell to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, with revenue from claims and determined securities, as well as the liquidation of the target stocks of the credit transactions fell to 5 million euros, with a decrease of more than 70 percent.
Only the higher revenue resulting from the reimbursement of the post-reform Depfa group’s accounting costs, as well as the reimbursement of interests under the tax regulation and the transactions brought to the group’s companies resulted in a relatively moderate round 16% income deficit.
The former state funder, after the privatization in 1990, first speculated on corporate real estate loans, which were later separated from the Aeral Bank.
Since the classic state funding could make less money, Depfa has increased its involvement in infrastructure projects as well as private-public partnership (PPP) and expanded its activities internationally.
For the value of the subsidiaries, Hypo Real Estate now has to make descriptions that have a "essential effect" on the group's outcome detection - it was quite generally.
In fact, dividends were not paid.
The dividend was reduced to a third by 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure funding provider since Depfa’s acquisition.
In comparison with other financial institutions, it is more dependent on interbank market refinancing as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the US Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the bank’s mutually loaning has failed as the banks keep their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets each year to refinanc a part of Depfa’s credit portfolio – about €50 billion.
According to a statement by Hypo Real Estate, the group’s funding demand is covered with the loan for a time and the company is protected “from the influence of the currently highly unfunctional international monetary markets.”
According to other sources, thanks to the money, refinancing is guaranteed by the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, Chairman of HRE, said that Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to take advantage of the financial markets for a long time.
The Federal Bank of Germany and the Federal Financial Services Supervision Authority (BaFin) believe that the Hypo Real Estate Group’s market capacity is now guaranteed.
This gives hope to the bank’s shareholders and creditors.
However, due to the dynamics and invaluability of the crisis, certain cannot be in it.
It is not even unimaginable that it is not necessary to fully use the funding.
But this opposite cannot be excluded.
After the late news on Saturday night said the bank was still on the edge of bankruptcy, even the temporary rescue of the equal could not calm the pleasures.
The stock exchange rate dropped by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, bond rates are quite good.
While the first-listed debts are hardly changing, the exchange rates of the later-listed bonds have declined significantly.
The crisis affects the bonds of the former subsidiary, Württemberg Hypo, and, as available, the currencies beyond 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds previously seemed to be a speculative investment alternative, their values must now be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system as the outbreak of the banking crisis and the result that the financial institution brought the crisis almost home with Depfa’s acquisition.
As long as the central banks, governments and the less endangered business banks are still ready to support the system, it is possible to start with a deadline refund.
Or something that is happening in which now almost no one can hope that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports relating to partial nationalization, the probability that is limited to certainty is now merely a legitimate hope.
For long-term lenders, the decision to get rid of their investments can cause sleepless nights.
Short-term investors may, however, use the sale to make a reserve on the taxes to be paid after the exchange rate gains in the coming years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Intense Box
When the 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to show up at the Tachibana High School on her first day of teaching, the girls begin to shout: The German girl is total "kawi"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana is already familiar with the word from the mangas - in the new exchange-blog, she tells about Japan.
“The first day of teaching in Japan.
I was very nervous.
I was inflamed on my way to school.
I live on the shore of Tokyo, towards Kavasaki, and I travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn’t get wrong.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachiba is not taken as seriously as at home, in Lower Soviet Union.
Students begin to swallow from eight p.m. until eight p.m. and 40 p.m. a short conversation begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the teaching began, I was on my turn to present it.
But I’m not the guy who likes to talk to people, especially before a class of 40 students.
Since I had no school uniform yet, I picked up a old jacket from my hostess, adding a blue, a blue knee and a black leather shoe.
In this dress I stood therefore in front of the cathedral and tried to make everything right: "Sajonara, vo se Sylvana ..." - they call Sylvana, I came from Germany, and in a week my birthday will be.
At that moment I was very happy that I started learning the language for two years.
All the 31 girls were shaking, shaking and shaking, and I heard the word "kavaí" constantly.
I know this from the manga.
This belongs to the basic word for Japanese girls and means “cuki, sweet.”
I quickly got to my place.
The girl sitting next to me smiled largely, and it was a honour that she was sitting next to the shields.
The rest of the clock was quite quiet, but when the bell was called, they regularly hit me.
Everyone gathering spoke and laughed, and their questions put a hole in my abdomen - and it is quite difficult to understand the English of the Japanese.
During the break, everyone pulled out.
My hospitality also prepared for me such a meal - it’s completely different from the boring German tiger sandwiches.
I got spicy rice, small cabbage, salad made of corn and algae, fruit and a kind of tofued meat.
I don’t know what I eat in Japan.
The food looks strange and has a completely new taste.
Everything is really delicious.
Yes, maybe, except the salt beans, brrrr!
In Japanese schools, the interior is not just lunch.
It happens that a girl gives a boy a handmade insert, which he makes especially artistically - in the hope that he will get to know the boy closer during the lunch break.
I read this in my manga.
I wonder if I can see this here too.
“Why is Japan?” asked my friends when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always answered:
“Because you’re just charming.”
I have been reading manga for many years.
And to better understand the comics and the culture described in them, I once started learning Japanese.
It was clear to me that I would have to go here.
Because I am attracted to tradition and habits.
They are very appreciated here.
Japan, on the one hand, is the country of the latest techniques and trends - on the other hand, it is rigorous, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I’ve never felt lost even if Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve seen in my life.”
The rats also have emotions.
A rats or a mole escapes in the event of a danger. Does this mean he feels afraid?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that animals also have emotions.
But how can we see if they feel the same when they behave like us?
For years, famous scientists have published their articles in the "Edge" online magazine.
In one of the series, SPIEGEL ONLINE looks at the answers to the question "What is real without proofing?"
I believe that animals have emotions and other state of consciousness without me or anyone else to be able to prove this so far. It is true that we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of every human brain is the same.
However, as we explore other species and get the questions of perception or consciousness in general, we get to a difficult ground because the hardware does not match.
When a rats are in danger, they do the same as many other animals: they make themselves dead, escape or attack.
People behave in a similar way, from which some researchers conclude to comparable subjective experiences.
I do not believe in this.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our own subjective experiences to animals.
Circuits related to human consciousness, on the one hand, almost always contain the lateral prefrontal brain cells (for its role in short-term memory and in execution/management functions).
This wide area is more advanced for humans than for other primates, and it seems to be completely missing for other living creatures.
At least from the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal brain cavity, such as the consciousness of who we are, or with the ability to plan and make decisions, it is justified to assume that a person is different even from the other major creators.
Another dramatic peculiarity lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since a significant part of human experience is related to the language, it is often claimed that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
However, even if consciousness was not dependent on the language, the language would surely influence it, so the animal consciousness, whatever nature it is, is likely to be very different from most of our state of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness can be for other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured as an internal and subjective thing, and it cannot be analyzed on the basis of our own experience due to the special hardware, then its research will bring us to serious problems.
Most of my heads are about the content of conscious life, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is likely to be more accessible to science.
The conscious processes of animals, regardless of their content, could be examined, and this is exactly what happens in the case of short-term memory experiments of the masterminders, especially in the example of visualization.
However, in this assumption studied by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they rely more on the nerve connections of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both can be the same or not.
Interestingly, this assumption also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal brain cough in the formation of visualization.
What about these emotions?
I lead this back to the fact that an emotional system, like fear, is activated in the brain that is aware of its own activity.
What we call "fear" is, therefore, the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defensive system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies the work memory.
Thus, examining the emotions are closely linked to the areas of the cerebrospinal cavity that are characteristic of the main sensors and especially of man.
In addition to the linguistic nature, perception is divided into subtle degrees, because with the help of words and linguistics we are able to distinguish and categorize states, to describe them to others besides ourselves.
On the contrary, for example, Antonio Damasio is the opinion that emotions are derived from the simpler activities of the body perception areas of the cerebrospinal and cerebrospinal cord, as well as Jaak Pankseep, who, however, is more focused on the cerebrospinal cord.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can easily play a role in the emotions that encompass the species.
Clearly theoretically, I cannot deny this, but I consider it unproved.
Pankseep believes that what seems a fear for rats and humans is likely to be felt in both cases: How can we check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave the same way?
A puppy escapes when it comes to danger, is he also afraid?
In my opinion, just similar behavior does not prove the same experience yet.
Nevertheless, neurological comparisons help further: rats and humans have a brain like them, but sheep don’t have a brain.
Is the brain responsible for emotions?
And even if this could be proved to humans: how can we prove this in the case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, but even cats (who knows?) have emotions.
I don’t know how to prove this.
And since their emotions are suspiciously fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circles and language), I’m looking for the emotional behavior of rats rather than the emotional emotions.
In any case, the progress in this area is imminent at the neural level, if the same is measured in rats and humans.
As with rats, I do not explore language and consciousness, I do not explore emotions, because I do not know whether they exist.
For others, this may seem to be a short-looking attitude, but I’m going forward rather than constantly striking to a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Good time for Poland and Ukraine
Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunik said the preparations will soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the confidence in Ukraine in the UEFA bordeaux decision and the testimony of it that they believe that Ukraine, together with Poland, is able to organize the European Championship," Vaszjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there’s still a lot to do in both countries.”
With regard to the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, both host countries are missing.
It is possible that the number of EB stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste more time.
We need to work at the highest speed now,” said Ukrainian Football Federation chairman Grigorij Surkis.
“UEFA will keep us in mind.”
In Poland, it is a more radical move.
The National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN alliance, replaced by the independent supervisory commissioner Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission was gathered on the initiative of Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
“We’ve made a list of warnings to UEFA President Michel Platini that this will not adversely affect the preparations for the 2012 EC.”
Only in the last season several first league teams had to be ranked in the lower class due to manipulation and eventually the league had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid Returns
The actress wanted to promote a new film, in the interview she talked about her privacy - and now she has had trouble with her former husband. And Ryan, a Hollywood star, has qualified her former husband, Dennis Quaid, as a divorce.
Who gets back and gets back
The Late Rose War in Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid's ex-wife: The two Hollywood actors, seven years after their divorce, have a terrible struggle with each other - before the public.
In an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week, Ryan first stated about the reasons for the divorce: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, causing a lot of pain."
It was only after the divorce that Dennis learned how many women he deceived.
The spiritual striptease took place due to Ryan's new film "Women", which tells the story of a divorce.
Dennis Quaid strongly reacted to his declaration of his unfaithful husband: “It’s terrible,” the 54-year-old actress told the New York Daily News, “that Meg unnecessarily repeats and covers the story of our relationship.”
In addition, it’s “fortunate” that the 16-year-old joint boys, Jacket, are repeatedly “openly reminded of the many pain and changes that the divorce causes a child.”
While Ryan has lived alone since his divorce, Quaid has been married again and has recently become a couple's father.
That’s why his answer ends with the following side cut: “My life continues anyway.
I’m happy to know that I have a wonderful family where everything is best.”
Flight tickets and hotel rooms are falling.
In the first half of 2008, European flights and accommodations were cheaper than the previous year.
According to a recent study, airways in Germany are not less than 50 percent cheaper.
The prices for airways and hotel rooms were again more affordable - so summarized the results of one of the American Express travel and financial providers' studies.
The company analyzed its first semester booking data in 2008 and found a significant decline in the second quarter following the first quarter price rise.
Since the prices on the hotel market have risen for years, accommodation in many places has become cheaper.
Between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, during the period from April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
This trend was most clearly shown in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30-37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reason for this is seen by American Express in the low exchange rate of the dollar, which has led to "the wicked travel interest of American tourists".
The drop in hotel room prices affects more financial centers such as Frankfurt or London than industrial cities such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rise by 26.3 per cent is a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, the price of air tickets also changed.
As a result of the increased cost of kerosine, passengers in the tourist class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, while long-term flights with high fuel demand were 29.2 percent more expensive.
Between April and June, the price of tourist-class flights dropped an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in business and first-class prices showed a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices rose by 11.9 percent and fell by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
The price of domestic flights in Germany has dropped by half, according to the study.
The reason for the price decline is, on the one hand, the decrease in economic growth, the company says.
The demand in many sectors of the airline market has been weakened.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement to liberalize air travel between the United States and Europe increases the pressure on the competition situation.
The tension is justified by the fact that airlines cancell their losing flights, and many airlines bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe it affects 24 airlines.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1-0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV was in front of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find the working team.
Kristoffer Klein enlargement Deep flight for the national team Marko Marin.
The gladbach player was only late in the game, and his lift was pulled back from the gate.
His exactly formulated message convincingly left his mouth.
He simply knew he was right.
“We need the second goal,” Hermann Rieger spoke at the corridor leading to the cabins of the Hamburg Arena.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break ended, and most of them sat on their place again.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist for HSV for three decades, enjoying a greater reputation than some of the gameplay players.
His request was heard in the appropriate place.
Cornelius Jol was an assistant and agreed to show up his finger.
Cornelius is the brother of the Hamburg leader, Martin Jol.
His commandment could be the same: Here with the second goal!
The execution of the order was missing.
“Today the view was not always beautiful,” Marcell Jansen later acknowledged.
Bastian Reinhardt also “imagined” the matter.
The goal score of 1: 0 (1: 0) is due to the head of the Hungarians Mladen Petric (11.); and the circumstance that the very weak Gladbachians could not cause pain to the weak Hungarians.
“It was a small victory,” said Martin Jol.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old on Monday.
The spectators celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the table on the showcase that showed their team as the first class of the championship.
It will be a birthday without a party.
“We know where to do it,” Marcell Jansen said.
He realizes that the intermediate evidence in the table is more likely to indicate the unpredictability of the league than the dominance of the HSV.
Although the team finds itself slowly, but is not still brilliant, thanks to its late commitment - the Brazilian Names and Silva, the captain Petric and Jansen from FC Bayern.
“We need more sensation and action,” Jol said.
After the vote
The Wall Street is scared.
As a result of the first news of the failure of the rescue package, Dow Jones temporarily dropped by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss in one day in my history.
Later, the Dow increased a bit.
At 20:30 a.m., the world’s largest stock barometer was at a low rate of 5 percent and at 10,579 points.
The technology paper trader Nasdaq fell to 1548 points with more than seven percent minus.
Dow's biggest loser at this time was American Express with a loss of 14%, followed by Bank of America with a loss of 12%.
No paper was strengthened.
Goldman Sachs shares have dropped by 10 percent.
Just a few days earlier I bought a bank share of Warren Buffett’s big investor.
In the framework of the rescue action, resources are planned to be provided for the purchase of so-called doubtful hypotheses.
However, the amount is not to be paid simultaneously, but gradually.
In exchange, the state would receive the currencies of the stock option of the financial institutions, which would be profitable if the exchange rates had evolved properly, reducing the burden of the state cash.
European and U.S. stock exchange rates
The billions of aid to European and U.S. banks do not dissolve investors’ doubts.
Hypo Real Estate’s German big bank’s stock rate falls and catches Dax with it.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is down despite the government’s plan to save the monetary market.
Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank’s spectacular exchange rate losses dropped the German stock index (Dax) deep down.
Despite the federal government and private banks' rescue actions, the value of the real estate funding company in Munich fell by a quarter, with Commerzbank weakening by more than 20 percent.
The Dax scored below the 6,000 point limit and scored 5839 points with a 3.7 percent minus.
Stock markets around the world have been pushing on their knees.
In New York, Wall Street was open with significant losses.
Investors are afraid that the US government’s $700 billion rescue package will not be enough to push the money markets.
In the first hour of trade, Dow lost 334 points, which was 3.3 percent down to 10.809.25 points.
The House of Representatives will vote on the rescue plan and the Senate will vote on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also know only one direction: in London, the FTSE index weakened by 3.2 percent, and in CAC 40 in Paris, it lost by 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index dropped by 1.26 percent to 11.743.61 points.

Dark matter affects spacecraft flight
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing dissatisfaction among researchers for years. The dark matter affects the speed of spacecraft during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be completely correct.
The "Ulysses" spacecraft has been flying in space for 18 years.
Due to the soon freezing fuel lines, the freezing is threatened to death.
For years, scientists have caused confusion among a mysterious phenomenon, the swing-by anomaly.
The swing-by means the gravitational level measurement of spaceconds, during which they get additional impulses in a heavens body, such as the Earth’s gravitational field.
Thus, the sandwiches can save a large amount of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research son, like the Ulysses solar son, also used this physical trick.
But what has fascinated the researchers for years: Flying objects do not behave fully as expected by the ancient law of gravity.
Instead, disorders occur in the speed.
Sounds are suddenly accelerating or slowing down.
Physicists have not found any explanation for this effect.
This phenomenon is called a swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be completely correct, which perceives the mass attraction of the matter as a curve of space.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, continues to strongly believe that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly with the so-called dark matter that astronauts discovered in the universe.
"The anomaly may be the dark matter responsible, which may be found even close to Earth," writes Adler.
The existence of dark matter has been discovered by space scientists just ten years ago.
It obviously develops a gravitational force that can be observed by the effects on other celestial bodies.
However, the substance itself is completely invisible, i.e. no electromagnetic radiation, in particular visible light, does not emit or turn back.
Scientists estimate that a good fifth of the total mass of the universe consists of dark matter.
Egyptian tourists kidnapped
After spending ten days in the capture of their kidnappers, tourists who have been fled in Egypt are free again, the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
Sudanese kidnappers demanded millions of euros of rescue.
In the shooting before the thieves were released, six thieves were to have died.
Five German citizens have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on rescue are ongoing.
The Germans are again and again the target of the kidnappers.
The WELT ONLINE reports the most important cases.
European tourists in Sahara are free.
This was by Egyptian state television, Al-Arabian Arab television and Italian media.
According to the Italian Sky TG 24 television broadcaster, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of the release: "Our companions and the other thieves have been released.
We are currently examining their health,” Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians, and one Romanian citizen, as well as eight Egyptian companions, are safe and safe, the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are allegedly on the way to Cairo.
A Egyptian security official said the hostages had already shown their willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army surprisingly killed them.
“The problem has been solved.
The rescue was accepted,” the official said.
"The trial was just about the capture of the hostages," when suddenly the "surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two of them.
The kidnappers demanded a rescue of €6 million from Germany; the money had to be transferred to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The al-Masri al-Jom newspaper, referring to a German mediator, that the release of the hostages is withdrawn because the kidnappers are worried about their own integrity.
According to the report, the kidnappers will release the female hostages after paying the rescue.
The kidnappers are held in prison until they find a safe way to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo was not willing to take a position on the report.
“Self-made” violence in Mostohaapa
The court said a woman committed suicide because her husband had been raping her for years.
The 57-year-old Michael Trerise, who lives in the Cornwall county of Stithians, was sentenced to six years in prison after confessing an attempt to violate sex in the eighth order.
The Criminal Court of Trudeau has been informed that it has regularly bound her murderer, Stephanie Randle, between the age of five and seven.
In one of his confessions, Trerise wrote: “I feel responsible for his death.”
Randle committed suicide at the age of 34 in his home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise closed her eyes before the relationships, while her mother worked in a beer shop.
Trerise left her wife in the 1980s and again chose Cornwall to reside.
She moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial it was revealed that Randle, who spent a lot of time as a volunteer at the National Trust Monument Protection Organization, was persecuted by the horrors of twice a week repeated violence.
In 2006, Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Mrs. Randle, who previously passionate about surfing and cycling, said her friends were "emotional dead" and "thinking about life".
In April 2007, his father, Terrance Randle, was found dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
He’s probably wrapped himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle was in trouble with his daughter's mother-in-law, who concluded his testimony in a letter, saying, "I have always swallowed and closed his eyes.
I have not sexually harassed.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You’re an extremely strange fetishist, and you’re sure that this was terrible for your victim, especially if she was just seven years old.
This unpleasant family story ended with the victim being committed suicide.
Even more thoughtful, however, is the fact that if he did not do so, the case’t have been brought before the court.”
The judge added: “I would draw the attention to how Stephanie’s parents said the crime you committed had an impact on their daughter over the years.
If that didn’t happen, she would probably be a hopeful, successful and happy young woman.”
Man who lost important data has been charged.
According to the BBC, a government official was accused of violating official secrets, who forgot strictly secret documents on a train in June.
The man was sent by the Ministry of Defence when he left two strictly secret documents on a Waterlooba train.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the simplest charges related to the breach of the law and there is no suspicion of intentional abuse.
Frank Gardner, a spokesman for the BBC’s defence ministry, said the move surprised many in Whitehall.
"They believed that the Ministry of Defense and the government would deal with the case as an internal affairs," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed has been charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the law. This paragraph concerns the preservation of information.
The State Prosecutor's Office suggested that the charges against the officer were brought by the Metropolitan Police to represent the man because of his relatively sensitive work related to the United Intelligence Committee.
The documents he lost included secret investigations on al-Qaeda and Iraqi military capabilities.
He was informed of the decision on Monday and then moved from his home to an unknown place.
Apartment builders pay for B&amp;B accounts
Britain’s housing cooperatives could expect an account of more than £80 million after the Bradford &amp; Bingley bank was rescued.
The government spent £14 billion on 2.6 million account owners to protect deposits placed at Bradford & Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of the depository owners, including 59 housing-building cooperatives.
Adrian Coles, chairman of the Association of Housing Construction Cooperatives (BSA), said it is "foolish" that companies and their members have to pay.
The reimbursement of the $14 billion loan will eventually be done after the reimbursement of the Bradford &amp; Bingley mortgages.
However, the accumulated interest is imposed annually on the 700 financial companies that use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation System has confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing-building associations are among them.
It is embarrassing that the institutions that have so far been careful ... now have to pay the accounts of those institutions that have been much less careful.
by Adrian Coles, BSA
We learned that every company must pay in the proportion of the deposit amount it possesses. Companies share 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the amount of the loan in 2009 will reach £450 million.
This means that companies will have to waste £81 million to pay interest in the first year.
Adrian Coles, Chief Executive Officer of the Union of Housing Construction Companies, told BBC that he considered the measure unfair.
“It’s disappointing that those institutions have to pay the accounts of the much less cautious institutions that were careful at the time of the resurrection of the housing market.”
According to BSA, no company has been destroyed since it started operating in 1945.
"We need to look at this case in all aspects over the next few weeks to decide how to protect housing companies and their members from a significant amount of account," Cole added.
The interest rate in 2009 covers 7 months from the end of September to the end of March of this year.
In 2010, a total annual interest will be paid, which can be even twice the current.
Since housing cooperatives are self-help organizations without shareholders, members will eventually have to pay the invoice, either by higher fees or by lower interests received after their deposits.
The price of milk increases by five pounds per liter.
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey Milk Company announced that it will raise the wholesale price of milk by another five pounds per liter from Monday.
This year, this is the second price rise since the two penny rise in February and a survey conducted by a consulting company.
The retailer will decide whether to continue the price rise for consumers.
Before the February rise, the wholesale price of milk in Jersey last changed in 2002.
Bangladesh's former parliamentary representative's request to defend him freely
The court in Bangladesh has rejected the request for the former parliamentary deputy, Sheikh Hasina, to be released, meaning that he may be arrested when he returns to the country.
His lawyer said that the court refused to defend him on his freedom in connection with the allegation that during his parliamentary representation he had dismissed 50 million items from a businessman (729,700 dollars).
This is just one of the countless corruption accusations against him.
Sheikh Hasina's former political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released this month.
Sheikh Hasin must return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but his party, the Awami League, demands that the country’s army-backed temporary government first give him full release.
According to the reports, although he was conditionally released in order to go abroad for medical treatment, the condition of his release is not clear whether he can retain his freedom when he returns to the country.
His lawyers say he will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Court of Appeal.
“The Court of Appeal rejected the request for Sheikh Hasina’s custody by saying that it was not necessary because he has been temporarily released and is engaged in medical treatment abroad,” said Rafique-ul Huq’s lawyer.
“We will appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal.”
His lawyers argue that he needs the defence on his freedom to return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
One leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17.
He was arrested last year after a military-backed temporary government took over power, but was released from prison in June in order to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all accusations against them.
Preoccupations about the polio vaccination program in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, 200,000 children in Afghanistan have been dismissed from the recently organized polio vaccine program due to Taliban-related violence.
Last week, the United Nations organized a vaccination campaign in six provinces.
However, they said they could not reach children living in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A spokesman for the United Nations said this all happened despite the taliban’s promise that they will not attack or block the work of thousands of vaccine personnel.
BSkyB's appeal against ITV was rejected
BskyB's appeal was rejected against the decision of the Competition Committee, which ordered to reduce its interest in the rival TV, the ITV.
The Court of Appeal of Competition ordered BSkyB to reduce its share in ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
Earlier, the committee found that BSkyB’s shares hindered competition and brought the company to an unfair influence over the ITV.
BSkyB bought its share in 2006 and thus effectively prevented NTL - which has since been renamed Virgin Media - from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Office that the shares purchased by BSkyB from ITV threatened the independence of ITV, encouraging the Competition Committee to launch an investigation.
Virgin’s chief executive, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom’s supervision all opposed the acquisition.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of the ITV partition was an irrelevant and disproportionate reimbursement - especially given that BSkyB stated it would be willing to give up its voting right.
New investigation of the US prosecutors
The U.S. Supreme Prosecutor has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the expulsion of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The move was followed by the report by the chief supervisor of the judicial portfolio criticizing the decisions of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Chief Prosecutor, Alberto Gonzalez.
The investigation was ordered because it was fearful that the prosecutors were dismissed for political reasons.
Nora Dannehy, the special prosecutor, will now investigate whether the officials heard during the investigation have tried to prevent justice with a lie.
“These serious accusations concerning the possible crime have not yet been investigated and cleared,” said Chief Inspector Glenn Fine.
One of the main proposals was to appoint a special prosecutor, who has the power to force witnesses to testify.
The series began with the dismissal of nine US prosecutors from office in December 2006.
They said that the prosecutors were dismissed because of their poor performance.
However, it was later revealed that the dismissed prosecutors had no worse assessment than many of their other colleagues. Therefore, many came to the conclusion that behind the dismissals there was a political consideration.
Some prosecutors were involved in the criminal proceedings of high-ranking Republican congressional members, while others were not willing to participate in the investigation of the allegations of election fraud against Democrats.
The U.S. State Prosecutors, on behalf of the government, are conducting investigations and proceedings.
They can be dismissed at any time, but cannot be removed from their position for political reasons.
The then head of the judiciary, Alberto Gonzales, became the target of the attacks because of the expulsions and eventually resigned.
A number of other officials also resigned.
In the report of the Chief Prosecutor, Gonzales greatly criticized his role in the case. He says the Chief Prosecutor is "principal responsibility" for the dismissals, his "disclosed" leadership role, and "consciously pulled out" from the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, the former Bush assistant, are criticized by the lack of cooperation in the investigation.
Meat Loaf is awarded
The rock star Meat Loaf will be awarded at the Q Awards gallery for his epic song "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will receive his special gold degree award next week at the London ceremony, said he considered the award an honor.
The nine-minute, fifty-five-second song was the headline of the 1977 album Meat Loaf.
Coldplay has received the most nominations for this year’s awards, listed in four categories.
Paul Rees, the chief editor of the Q magazine said: "There are some songs that cross the boundaries of time or genres, and the "Bat Out Of Hell" is like that."
The song acquired by Jim Steinman demanded a very high sound, and that sound was Meat Loafé.
The song began with a two-minute musical episode.
He appeared as a small album in 1979 and reached the 15th place in the slager lists.
However, Meat Loaf’s album “Bat Out Of Hell” has been on the tracklist for nine years, and more than 40 million copies have been sold.
Meat Loaf - his real name is Marvin Lee Aday - is currently facing health problems. among other things, in 2003 he was undergoing surgery due to a heart rate disorder after he fell on stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel a few concerts due to a severe pneumonia.
Later it was revealed that there was a cyst on the soundtrack.
Unknown metropolitan street, which is often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of roads, roads and other subroads. Some of them are famous, others are simply practical.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and local residents who have lived here for a long time would have difficulty telling where the Extra Place is located, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The small street is located in East Village and goes north of the First Street - without getting to the Second Street - between the Bowery and the Second Street.
It is approximately 9 m wide and 36 m long, and is much more like a dust shaker than a main transport route.
There are no road tables.
Practically, it cannot be found on a standard map.
There are fans on the street.
There is, for example, the Avalon Bay, the building of the newly built First Street luxury buildings.
You want to cover the Extra Place again and you want to make sure you can get to the shops and boutiques of the new buildings on a cleaner way.
Among the street admirers are the neighbors who have lived here for a long time, who have been captured in the cottage of the cottage that it was the only remains of the neighborhood's past before the renovations.
However, the street owner, the city’s building conservation and development department, does not have to insist on it.
This month, at a meeting of the district municipality’s area management committee, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the constructor would buy the street.
However, the committee would rather want the street to remain in the city’s management and asked for a new plan for the next month, said Susan Stetzer, the district leader of the 3rd municipal body.
"There are very few areas already in the city's possession and we want the Extra Place to remain in the city," he said.
“There may be some proposals for renovation and management that Avalon can make, but we also want to ensure that it remains available to the public.”
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it wanted to cover the small street again and provide seats. Some of them would be used by a cafe, whose builders are expected to rent a area.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first made public at this monthly session.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not insist on its ownership.
"The main aspect of Avalon Bay is to restore this scattered resort and make it a pleasant public place," he said, adding that the city proposed to buy it.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Building Conservation Office, said that the city would really want to sell the street, and noted that the office's task was to develop buildings and not to manage them.
For its more colourful neighbor, compared to Bowery, the Extra Place has not much historical significance.
Some say that he was named "no one's land" in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's great possession was divided among his countless children, and the narrow land range was no demand for anyone.
The 2006 closed punk-rock monument, CBGB's back exit opened to the Extra Place, and the street is the most famous of the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"It was a great place," said Danny Fields, the manager of Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
“He was filled with rubbishes, clothes, bars and poster pieces, and sheets and wings.”
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how the middle class took East Village into possession, are opposed to the sale of the Extra Place. They argue that this piece of public property, no matter how modest, should remain in possession of the community.
Others mention the Extra Place as a rarity, which is a piece of the city that is practically unchanged and which must be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, the writer of the blog "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" ("The Book of Irrals: The Sad nostalgia of the City's Disappearance") posted on his blog a part of the story of the Extra Place, which was published in the 1952 section of the weekly newspaper "The New Yorker" "The City's Speech".
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "The Extra Place is a narrow, small hole street that is even dark during the day, bound by rubble, iron-made warehouse doors and spalling windows, and where one-week newspapers are carried by the wind in the channels."
The street, except for some exceptions, looked the same as a few nights ago.
A rats fled through the end of the street, next to the back door, which once led to the CBGB, and now belongs to a higher-priced clothing store on its site.
The walls had a graffiti, and a empty 0.75 litre beer was located next to a throwed, fresh paper.
Some passengers said they rarely get in mind of the Extra Place, but they think they would get in mind of the renovation.
Fields said he believes some people underestimate his attraction in the current state of the street.
“I’ve spent the most beautiful years of my life in dark, smooth, and wicked places,” he said.
Debate on bilingual education: Continuous exposure to the English language environment
In this section, the Education Observer discusses Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi’s representative opinions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, who is an experienced researcher of California Studies at the Pacific Institute of Public Policy Research and the chief director of educational research, is the co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why a middle class needs a school choice option."
It is not easy to go in favor of voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are also included.
According to Obama’s campaign, “Aphro-American and Spanish lips students are significantly less likely to get a degree than white students,” and that’s true.
In order to overcome such performance differences, Obama’s educational plan expressly supports – among others – the “transitional bilingual education” for English students.
At the same time, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on non-English school education, is beyond his interest in dealing with large performance differences.
Take for example the Sixth Street Prep contractual primary school in the east of Los Angeles County.
Most of the school students are Spanish lips and low-income.
More than one-third of students - many of whom recently arrived - learn English.
Nevertheless, 100% of the fourth classmates achieved excellent results at the 2008 state mathematics exam.
It is equally impressive that 93% of fourth-class students completed an excellent English language and literature exam.
This incredible achievement was not achieved by the means that Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street focuses on repetition, practice, continuous assessment of skills and rejection of excuses.
In addition, and that’s what Obama should take into account, according to Linda Mikels, Director of Sixth Street, the school’s educational principle is the “complete immersion” of students learning English into the linguistic environment.
The essence of the intrusion method is the almost exclusive use of the English language in teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, said: “We’ve had a tremendous success in the fact that if someone entered a classroom, he would not realize who was the student who arrived from Mexico 12 months ago.”
“It works,” he said, “It works for us.”
Would Obama put schools like the Sixth Street Prep as an example to other schools that teach a large number of Spanish-language and English-language students?
The results achieved by the school should be clear to give the answer, however, because of its own party’s education policy (National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education), and since it itself consistently stands for bilingual education, we cannot be sure of Obama’s response.
Although he agrees that immigrants need to learn English, Obama has recently stated that people should not be so worried about the legislation "only in English".
Instead, he said, “They should get to their children to speak Spanish.”
If Obama really wants to get to reduce the differences between the results, he should seriously study the models that work, instead of lensing and taking them out.
The oil price has dropped due to economic concerns.
On Monday, oil prices fell sharply due to concerns that the U.S. financial market rescue plan will not be able to revive the economy.
The price of oil dropped by 7 percent to $99.80 in the morning at the New York Stock Exchange.
The prices have dropped by more than $20 per barrel since Monday.
Over the past two weeks, the stock exchanges have been overwhelmed by the Wall Street financial confusion and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
Since prices reached $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before they were again affected by the immeasurable uncertainty of the financial markets.
On Monday, concerns brought investors back into power even after Congress leaders announced that they were able to reach an agreement on the economic rescue, which is considered to be the largest ever in history.
The news reveals concerns that the financial crisis will not be over for a long time.
As the latest event in the emerging crisis, Citigroup will buy the Wachovia Corporation banking business, the government announced on Monday.
Meanwhile, the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
According to Barclays Capital analysts, as a result of the desperate weekend talks, "this seems that the rescue operation failed to revive the stock exchange interest."
As the economic situation deteriorates, the demand for goods, such as oil, is also expected to decrease.
“The future of the stock market, interest rates and currency exchange rates has become uncertain worldwide,” Deutsche Bank’s analyst wrote to investors.
“We believe that the market of goods will not be avoided by the epidemic.
In terms of the stock market, the biggest question is how much the U.S. “sickness” infects the whole world, China.”
As oil consumption decreased due to the slowdown of economic growth, banks’ analysts declined from their expectations for the next year, reducing their oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20%.
In the second quarter, the team set a record.
After spending more time in the Jets field over the past eight seasons than anyone else, Shaun Ellis, playing in the defensive end position, thought he had seen everything.
But then he watched the development of the second quarter on Sunday, when Jets turned a point-free game into a sensational game.
“I’ve never seen it before,” said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals' lagy game was fully aligned with the dark clouds on the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback, gave a 12-way touchdown pass to Laveranues Coles. This became a perfect predecessor for a afternoon in which their developing cooperation progressed significantly.
Favre gave Coles two more touchdown passes in this quarter, including when two cornerback runs 10 seconds before the half-time end.
"I didn't regret the fatigue," Favre said about all the passes given to Coles.
“Pokoli is a good player.
So far, we have been able to communicate well with each other, regardless of what people think.”
While Favre and Coles played the ball, the defence stopped the Cardinals manager, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, playing in the cornerback position, took a bad throw and returned with 32 yards, which reached a touchdownt.
Eric Smith, a safety player went into another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, the linebacker, was able to kick the ball out of Warner's hand.
This last round could have been the most amazing move in the match.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end and the Jets won it, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard field goal, setting the 34:0 result.
This was the best result that Jets has achieved in a quarter.
When asked the Jets coach, Eric Manginit to characterize the distorting character of the game, he said, "The second or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - in the third quarter the Cardinals earned 21 points so that the Jets did not earn one - Mangini said: "I have to say that I the second quarter much better than the third.
We got a lot of points in a short time.”
Gebrselassie breaks its own world record
The Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many believe he was the best medium and long-range rider ever, when he broke his own world record on Sunday in Berlin, making him the first to run 42.2 kilometers in 2 hours and 4 minutes.
In a conveniently flat track, with a victory at 2:03:59 time, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds with the previous 2:04:26 result, which he achieved last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie set the 26th world record in his career in so many fields that he won the world championship in almost every way from the 1500 meters to the marathon, or reached a world record.
Last month, Gebrselassie left the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, fearing - which, looking back, was too cautious - that air pollution would further aggravate his asthmatic problems.
He went to the Berlin Marathon.
In almost perfect conditions - in the daytime, at 9 °C at the beginning and at 13 °C at the end - Gebrselassie won on Sunday, incredible, 2 minutes with a speed of 56 seconds per kilometer.
Since runners like Gebrselassie and Kenyan Paul Tergat have turned to the long-term, the marathon record has dropped by more than two minutes in the last decade since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in 1998 at 2:06:05.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had swallowed his two legs two weeks ago and failed to train for two weeks.
It is obvious that during the compulsory rest he was refreshing and didn’t be shaken.
“I’m so happy,” Gebrselassie told reporters.
“Everything was perfectly done.
A week ago I started training again and today I had doubts, but finally everything went well.”
He has received some criticism – especially from Kenya, the Eastern African rival of Ethiopia – that he uses too many tools during his competitions, usually avoids many world-famous marathon runners, depends on his runners as if he was running on the track, and puts world records in front of the competition.
However, this criticism hardly reduces Gebrselassie’s greatness in long-range running.
Gebrselassie arrived on Sunday at 1:02:04, with the contribution of four Kenyans.
Two leading Kenya runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after the runners were tired.
Not much more than 4.8 kilometers ahead of the goal, Gebrselassie left Kwambai with a last sprint, who reached the second goal with 2:05:36, improving by 5 minutes his individual best.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women’s competition, Kazakistan-born Irina Mikitenko, who is now a German citizen, closed a remarkable year with its seventh fastest win, 2:19:19.
The World Cup will be held by Paula Radcliffe at 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko won the London Marathon with a score of 2:24:14.
He was unable to take part in the Beijing Olympics due to alleged back injury, but he quickly healed and won the Berlin Marathon, where he improved by five minutes at the individual top. This was the third distant marathon run he took part in.
He won the competition with smart calculations: he first allowed a group of four people from Ethiopia and Kenya to move forward and gain significant leadership, and then followed them after running about 30 km.
The Ethiopian Askale Tafa Magarsa scored second with 2:21.31, while Kenya's Helena Kiprop scored third with 2:25:01.
A separate city, the pride and trials of the black
In the Greater Orlando Experience Park - a few miles away from everything that glowes, sounds and is huge - a quiet small town is hidden, where the pride and complications of the African American life experience are born.
Eatonville, the first pure black city to be integrated into the country and which was the home of Zora Neale Hurston’s childhood, is now not as simple as it described in 1935: “The five lakes, three crocott trails, 300 brown leather, 300 good swimmers, a lot of guayawas and two school cities, without prison.”
Now it is a hunting place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have already attended the annual Zora Festival. The eatonville celebration series is held in honor of Harlem Renaissance's most famous female writer, Hurston.
However, in many ways, the city described by it and made it a tourist attraction - which is also listed in the Florida Travel Book published by the Project of the Federal Writers of the Crisis Age - is distinct from its environment.
Just as independent, decent and closing as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote in Florida, urban black people were often unwilling to share their real thoughts with the white people who “know so little about us that they don’t know what they’re leaving off.”
Even in the year when the black presidential candidate, Barack Obama, encourages an open exchange of ideas on the racial issue, many here are unbelievable to the views of the outsiders.
“We’re very careful about how our story is told,” said 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lived here throughout his life and is a member of the city’s oldest church.
“You have to say right.”
Eatonville has long been characterized by the paradox of victory and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historically important model of the black standing, and at the same time a community of 2400 inhabitants where poverty indicators reach double the national average.
Partly a literary node, and partly an example of the result of American slavery, sometimes glorified, sometimes praised, southern, urban, black culture, which flourishes in the shade of peanut trees.
Therefore, it is not surprising that the people here are proud and defensive at the same time.
The image of Eatonville has been important since Zora (this is how everyone calls Hurston).
In books written in a sincere, strong dialect - such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937) - he presented his hometown to the world.
The five paragraphs of the Florida Roadbook transformed the city, which is located next to the 17th Road. This road leads from the long-forgotten centre of Florida to one of the sites of the history of the Black and human dramas.
Hurston, who was both courageous in life and literature, as well as throwing, introduced his readers to the business of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then looked into the more confidential spheres.
“On the way to the right we will find a modern public school, a brown-based white corner, carefully arranged courts and playgrounds that Howard Miller takes care of, although he can hardly write and read.”
He mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash, and wrote that Lee Glenn "sales all kinds of beverages and everything that may be needed in transitional houses."
Thus, in a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with autonomy, but at the same time with ignorance, re-marriage, and sex.
It is clear that the Fodor's travel book has shown it differently.
This description really didn’t like everyone.
"Zora said things as they were," said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls. Hurston made them immortal by quoting the screaming songs that men sang about their beauty.
He added, “Some people didn’t like it.”
Hurston is still remembered here as the living stranger who frequently visited his home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
The 77-year-old Augustus Franklin recalled that when Hurston went into the city, he usually arrived without notice in a bullshit Chevrolet, smoking, and long-packing into a city where people are still proud of their decent clothes today.
Most people were fascinated, Franklin said, but many were fit.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” Franklin said.
However, on the terrace with a view of Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added in his chair: "It never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and his books were no longer published again.
It seemed that together with much of the world, Eatonville had forgotten it.
Although she has ever been a popular writer, Langston Hughes' contemporary and the only black woman at the Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an invisible tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived before.
In Eatonville there were no significant memoirs or large, public lectures.
"I don't think they've understood how wealthy it has enriched the world, or what it has left us at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of the 2003 Hurston biography, "Covered in the Shadow".
The turn point came in 1980.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-band road through the city through the two-band main road, instead of the Kennedy railway, which played an important role in the community life.
The expanding Orlando has already penetrated by the Interstate 4 highway that connects the states on the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still on foot after a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, among other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggles related to racial confusion raised hatred to the community.
"At that time, a team of white boys passed and the people sitting on the edge of the road were thrown with orange and other things," Franklin said.
“There was a woman who died in this.
A Greek man was thrown out of a car.
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's decision to require violent integration. Thus he stated about the "Brown v. Board of Education" decision: "I am more offending than respecting my race."
Today, the inhabitants say that the desegregation of schools was positive in some ways, weakened the cohesion of the eatonville and undermined the youth’s self-confidence.
"The black children were used to kiss them - I remember that - the man kissed his teacher in the morning and in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins, the executive director of the non-profit organization "Save Me the Eatonville Community".
“It lasted until students and teachers came from a common place,” he added.
"We didn't embrace our white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there were cultural differences between us," Nathiri said.
However, human rights helped the rise of many other Zora Neale Hurston - in such black writers, actors and artists who surpassed the prejudices as she did, with such a clear self-confidence and lines as: "How can anyone get rid of the pleasure of my company!
This is incomprehensible for me.”
In 1975, Alice Walker travelled to Hurston's unknown tomb and began to struggle to return her reputation.
Five years later, a well-known Hurston biography, written by Robert E. Hemenway, was placed on the roofs of the bookstores, which again highlighted him as one of America’s examples.
The road construction project would have started just when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was back at the center of attention.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors regarded him as a savior.
In 1988, the community began to organize a Hurston festival to show what would destroy the county with its main route.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and since then many have returned to the celebration every January.
A few years later, the county resigned from the road construction proposal.
“Because of the main road’s fifth, the community has been revived, connected to a full speed, which is a real civil pride,” Nathiri said.
Boyd simply said, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped change the image of the city itself.
More and more people appeared outside the city, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to visit the church in 1993, and the locals began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was included in the National Historical List in 1998.
In 2006, the new one-level library (naturally named by Hurston) was opened on the rebuilt and beautiful Kennedy Road.
Eatonville remains Florida's cake egg: it's not just ten kilometers from the center of Orlando, but sometimes it feels like a suburban suburban in the summer rain time; it's as small as when it founded 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today 90% of the population is black.)
They are still cautiously welcomed by the outsiders who come here in search of the story of Eatonville, what to say.
Most interviews require a preliminary license, and some things - such as the oldest fresco of Eatonville, painted by a white man and painted by black people working on the ground - should not be photographed.
In Eatonville, many people - including the confident Jones teacher, who is attracted to the vibrant red - are afraid to be misunderstood in their separate community.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival has become wider and wider, the pride of the hometown has grown.
In particular, young people are increasingly looking at Eatonville as Hurston saw his own species: wonderful, with problems and with everything not better, not worse, as proud, creative, compassionate, foolish and confused as other racial and ethnic groups in America.
A sincere civil bond is silent from the words of Franklin's uncle, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return after graduating from college to work at the local government or police, who he says they need help.
And it seems that younger people have learned to properly characterize Eatonville, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park Twin: Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most people who are just going through here think this city is nothing compared to the rest," Alondra Kenon said recently after the worship on a Sunday.
"But if someone stops and takes a little time to learn about his history, then it's a very nice city."
We here in New York we all speak the language of finance
Nothing has changed on the surface.
If tourists don't care about the journalist's boots and the huge TV broadcasters on Times Square, they won't notice that they're in the midst of a storm.
They would never realize that with the glass walled, beef-shaped offices over their heads, the bankers and risk fund managers who hold New York in power are living the hardest days since 1929.
The runners are still rounding their metal tea cars on the paths, delivering muffin-covered plates for the morning talks.
Still, men with Spanish lips are scratched among the mass houses, wrapped as a human bear with fifty-seeked socks, hanging on their shoulders on a hole that looks like a hole.
Office workers are still on the line for their sweet breakfast cake at the food cars on the foot, and it is still impossible to take a taxi every day between 4 and 7 a.m.
I didn’t feel any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the emergency news, I decided not to open a new bank account.
I intentionally planned to do this at the time of the afternoon rest in my local JP Morgan Chase bank account, but 20 people were already in front of me.
Not at the bank wallet window where money can be picked up or paid, but at the customer service table where older customers order a checkbook, tourists ask for guidance to the Macy's store, and where new customers open a bank account.
Many people before me – I later learned of Star, the “ordered” banker – stood with the same intention as me.
However, unlike me, they have already taken their money from smaller banks in their residence, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They extracted money from so-called savings banks (such as housing-building cooperatives), credit associations, and small town savings that operate only in one state and allegedly treat their customers as a family member.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks went silently down.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with a capital of $327 billion, was bankrupt, and when the New Yorkers left home on Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, sought a bank rescue buyer with a savings of $440 billion.
The office and shop workers in front of me, afraid of a further collapse, transferred their money to a bank that seemed to be a safe refuge, to the bank that carries out most capital injection purchases on Wall Street.
Simple people in New York have become experts in finance over the past few weeks.
A woman in a local Chinese store on her phone spoke about the bankrupt Lehman Brothers bank and its huge-looking chief executive, Dick Fuld, as if she complained of a crazy colleague.
And Lyn, the cousin of my apartment’s uniform, who had been a cousin for fifty years, now we’ve not talked about Brad and Angelina, or my food supply as usual.
He said to me after I went to the bank: "I invested all my savings in money market assets.
I’ve changed, you don’t risk.”
Muslim tombs have been deceived while Austria runs to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, from the right-wing Belgian Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, presenting the organization "Cities Against the Conquest of Islam".
Traffic tables were drawn up with imitating signs that depicted mosques crossed by a red line.
According to the police, extreme-right extremists are responsible for the humiliation of Muslim funerals in Austria, which took place in the same weekend when the extreme-right parties significantly advanced in national parliamentary elections.
More than 90 tombs were seriously damaged in the traune cemetery near Linz, some time between Friday evening and this morning.
The criminals painted Jewish symbols, such as David's star, on some tombs, but the investigators said they only tried to hide their extreme motivations that arise from hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident can be linked in any way to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "heavily angry" with the hearing of the graves that took place shortly before the end of the Muslim religious month, Ramadan.
Meanwhile, Austria is conducting a conscience examination after yesterday’s parliamentary elections, during which the language of political balance is right-to-right.
The two extreme right-wing parties, which obtained 30% of the votes, campaigned for the Future of Austria by the Freedom Party and the Alliance, a strong anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were marked by their critics as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the president of the Freedom Party, who earned more than 18% of the votes, expressed its disappointment to the campaign against the heads and burks, as well as to the foods allegedly linked to Islam.
At the final summit in Vienna, the party talked about "European Brotherhood" which helps to prevent the strengthening of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets by argumenting that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Public opinions and analyses conducted immediately after the extreme right-wing elections show that the change was largely due to young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter is banned from travel abroad
Garry Glitter, a famous rock star sentenced for child rape, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
The judges decided after Glitter was banned for six months to inform the authorities that he intended to travel through France to Spain.
Kentucky police received a travel ban on Thursday after submitting evidence to the court of the convictions against Glitter on sexual violence against children.
Glitter, his real name Paul Gadd, did not participate in the Ashford Magistrates trial, but was represented by the lawyers of Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said: "On Thursday, September 25, the Kentucky police filed a request to the Ashford Magistrates Court to prevent Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain scheduled for March 25.
“Paul Gadd did not appear personally.”
The 64-year-old Glitter has informed the authorities of his intention to travel abroad because it is required by the law on the registration of those who committed sexual offences.
You must notify the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
It is also required to notify the police at least seven days before the planned departure.
If they do not inform the authorities, they may be sentenced to five years in prison.
Kentucky police said they don't want to talk about his unique cases in the Glitter County and his possible illusions.
A spokesman for Kentucky police said: “Kentucky police will do everything they can to protect children both in the country and abroad.
“We think it is easier to check someone without leaving the UK because we have a comprehensive system to manage potential risks more effectively.
“The main task of the Kentucky police is to protect the people of Kent. through close cooperation, we are constantly monitoring the behavior of persons in the register of sexual offences and living in the countryside to minimize the potential risks affecting the population.”
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnam prison for raping a 10-year-old girl and a 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he was flying to Bangkok, where he had to pass a plane to London.
However, he claimed he feels bad and was not willing to fly to London.
The landscape authorities did not pass the passport check, so he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also did not allow him to enter the country, so he returned to Bangkok, where landscape police and immigration agency officials insisted to return to the UK.
Finally, he arrived at the Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there until his lawyer, David Corker, went to the court in West London, Uxbridge, as he, according to a request by Scotland Yard, was registered in the register of the criminals under a court order.
Glitter previously spent four months in prison in the United Kingdom in 1999 for having pictures of child rape.
According to a resource from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of State for Internal Affairs, welcomed and welcomed that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
“I’m not taking pictures on the stage because I want to present the artist from a personal side.” – Günther Bauer
There are no decorations, no hairstyles, no dance shoes.
The grandmasters of flamenco are close to the body, without the excitement of action: to get to know the usual faces of dancers as well.
On the one hand the artist.
On the other hand, the ordinary.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except in the intimate, distant moments of the audience, when one-on-one movements can be taken, the depths of a captured look can be captured, or the beauty of the untouched but expressive hand of the artist who is not preparing for the stage.
In the German film series Günther Bauer Flamenco-people, the theatrality of singers, dancers and guitarists is combined with this less-known common side of the masters.
Through the photographs, you show the peculiar iconography of flamenco from different perspectives.
The exhibition, which is part of the Month of Flamenco Photography, "reflects the everyday growing international importance of Flamenco," the creator believes, adding that the Flamenco-People "actor could be anyone, since seeing the images the observer is shocked to realize that these images do not typically represent the artists.
These people in the street are artists who are able to bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and rape the audience.
At the same time, stage photography is not suitable for capturing their personality.
Their personality and character reside in the depths of their being.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to inherit the personality of the flamenco grandmothers with the help of the camera.”
The Cante de las Minas festival was driven by Bauer's long journey in 1997, during which he made portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers with a disc camera.
These portraits, thanks to the camera and the theme selection, quote classical photography.
However, the application of various stylistic instruments is interrupted with traditional imaging and suggests modernity. The following idea faithfully reflects Bauer's idea of flamenco: "This is a music with traditional roots, which, however, changes from day to day and is always impressive."
Not the dance, not the singing or the music itself, much more the artist’s personality, his character charms the audience.
In the days, the guiding motivation of works that can be seen in the El Fotomata Gallery is the search for the encounter with the essence, the artistic magic, which becomes visible through the way of perception, existence and display.
The famous figures of the flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, are the metal names of this photo collection that will be presented by 60 artists.
The project has also become a flamenco-antology, which will soon be released with an album covering the portraits presented at the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portrait has been rooted for two years to repeat the idea with the series "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concept of the Flamenco-People is slightly different from this, the photographer adds: "I really like to photograph people, know them and enter into their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, the hardest piece of photography is portrait.
The fate brings together people, you meet, personalities that you sometimes don’t know, or who only spend a few minutes taking pictures.
But despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.
The exhibition named Flamenco-People, selected from contemporary flamenco portraits, can be viewed by October 16 in the El Fotomata Gallery, located under the 20th rue de la Mata parallel to Alameda de Hércules.
According to Vargas Llosa, the novel on which he works is "ready wisdom"
The place and action is still unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa also strives to write his new novel. The main character of the novel is an Irish nationalist, Roger Casemant, who lived for twenty years in Kongo and traveled through the Amazon.
A writer who was also awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature on the Hay Festival Segovia event yesterday confessed that his current work was "ready for wisdom" and "every sign indicates that the novel should not be written".
"If I were smarter, I't do it, but I'll do it and I hope I'll be able to get a point to the end" - with these words he closed his performance at the Festival of Ideas, Thoughts and Opinion Exchange, which hosted hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of visitors for four days in Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the most prominent participants in the literature festival and also replaced the hopes attached to it.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival Award voted by the participants, a old edition of Dickens' novel "Our Common Friend".
After Felix Romeo's greeting, a dedicated audience was welcomed. The audience was quickly overwhelmed by the hour during which the Peruvian writer, with a stunning memory and a great dose of humor, told how the writer's vocation was formed from his special adventure of reading passion and the desire to live life; how he hunted his inspiration through a disciplined writer's method, striking documentation, many corrections and rewrite; how he influenced his writer's vocation by Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what memoirs his stories are based on.
The Latin American novelist acknowledged that it was impossible to discard or show whether books are changing our lives, but added: "I don't think literature is merely a fun or a purified life experience," because it affects people and drives them to think, so he asked the writers not to let the light be tempted and take responsibility for their vocation.
Because of the mostoha weather, Pozoblanco's goodbye is shorter, and the horse bikes are missing.
Traditionally held as the final event of the Pozoblanco holidays, the horse bikes was removed from the show yesterday morning after the future horse tourists found the arena field unsuitable for the tour.
As a result, the committee, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to miss the bikaviat.
Weather adjustments thoroughly shaped the celebration series, as two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, due to the rain, the second bowl was left.
The future protagonists, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, would have fought with Castilblancos birds.
It was only on Friday.
The winner became Daniel Luque, he brought three ears home as a trophy. After the sophisticated and aesthetic struggle he was lifted on his shoulder and brought around.
On the same afternoon, through the two bears of Alejandro Talavante, he gained numerous awards and an ear as a trophy, but this was more due to the audience than to his own performance.
However, it was followed by El Juli, who little contributed to the ageing reputation of the Los Llanos arena.
After a comfortable journey with the second bear, a large portion of the audience was able to get out of the hole.
A truck carrying two tons of hasis attempted to escape road controls
4 hours and 50 minutes.
The Basque Regional Police is carrying out traffic controls in the administrative area of Armiñón (Alava).
The authorities will stop a truck in which two passengers travel. Passengers are trying to escape the measure.
The shipping, more than two tons of hasis, was at the same time not impressive.
Investigators persecuted the passengers and one, a 28-year-old man, was arrested and identified as A.A.J., the Basque government’s Department of Internal Affairs said.
The man is accused of drug trafficking and document fraud.
The incident occurred in the administrative area of Armiñón, where Traffic Supervision staff conducted traffic inspections on the N-1 highway.
When they wanted to stop the truck, the driver denied obedience, suddenly gave gas and then left the checkpoint.
Investigators were persecuted, and the vehicle stopped a few kilometers further on the stop, and its passengers fled from the highway to a forest area.
The Basque Regional Police eventually captured one of them, and after examining the Iveco Daily brand truck, it ordered its shipping, 2,178 kilograms of hasis.
The backs that filled the back of the vehicle were delivered to the police agencies in order to undergo a more thorough investigation and remove the drug.
Furthermore, the inspection has proved that the vehicle’s false register does not match the data contained in the furgon papers, and therefore the detainees are also prosecuted for falsification of public documents.
The Basque Regional Police is ongoing the investigation, which aims to, on the one hand, arrest the other suspect who, as already mentioned, escaped from the highway, and on the other hand, determine the origin of the detected drug.
The 28-year-old accused, A. A. J., was delivered to the police to conduct the necessary investigations, and within a few hours the judicial action began.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Drugs
Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested by the police in Santa Barbara (California) this weekend because she was conducted under the influence of a drug.
A witness said he tried to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange maneuveres, a spokesman for the California Traffic Supervision Authority told the People magazine.
According to the witness, around 16:30 Locklear "pressed the gas to the floor, extended the engine, tried to leave the parking lot in front and back, and backwards passed through his glasses several times."
Shortly later, the eyewitness, who probably didn’t recognize the actress for the first time, saw Locklear standing on a nearby highway and leaving the car.
He also informed the police because he was "threatened for Locklear's life."
When the police arrived, the actress sat in her car, which partially disrupted the road traffic.
"It seemed to be a prison," so the guard was taken to a drug and alcohol examination center specializing in this.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was collaborating and alcohol consumption was almost immediately excluded. The spokesman also said that on the first impression of the officers they believe Locklear was under the influence of the drug.
Lockleart was arrested and suspected of driving under the influence of an unidentified drug. at around 19 a.m. he was transferred to the local prison, where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out two months ago from a sanatory in Arizona, where his anxiety and depression were treated.
Llamazares calls on the IU (United Left) Andalusian Federation to take action in the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, Secretary-General of the IU and Representative of the United Left today said that the organization's regional federation will make a decision in the case of former Youth and Sports Councillor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva. Silva resigned last week after being accused of abusing his position to benefit his family members.
“In these matters, I am a far-reaching federalist, and this matter is indeed within the competence of the Andalusian organization,” Llamazares pointed out the procedure that the party should apply against the former member of the Seville City Council.
On the other hand, IU’s chairman emphasized that the “transparency” should be taken into account when investigating the possible irregularities committed by Silva: “At IU has always been on the ground to ensure that such cases are the most transparent.”
He added that the training is part of “the strict ethical code for public employees.”
“May’s Blood”, Garci’s epic work
Benito Pérez's work "Galdós National Episodes" was inspired by José Luis Garcit, who quotes the famous anti-French Uprising of the Spanish in the May Blood, which, with a budget of 15 million euros, is his filmography's greatest work.
Accordingly, the director tried to illustrate the human flow and social analysis that he always admired in his work of the famous novelist. This is all that Garci told the popular audience of actors today at the film show with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría.
More than two and a half hours of May's Blood will be showed in the cinema on Friday, and later Telemadrid will be showed as a mini-series in a range of more than four hours.
José Luis Garci, the great admirer of Galdos literature, with this drawing realized his childhood dream. All of this is thanks to Esperanza Aguirr, because he commissioned three years ago from the Province of Madrid to make a memorial film for the 200th anniversary of the events in Madrid on 2 May. Garci accepted the request with the condition that the story could be based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget was fully funded by the Autonomous Province of Madrid, and it was a special opportunity for Garci: it was able to present "the disturbed Spanish people who were mistakenly at the side of the bad leader, as the struggle for independence pushed the country into a huge disadvantage with the rule of Ferdinand VII," he said.
The director, however, expressed his regret for failing to count on the budget of Alatriste or Goya's ghosts that dropped more than the double of May's blood. That's why he was forced to miss some scenes from the scenario, which - like many other times - is recorded together with Horacio Valcárcell.
So the director of the Renewal applied to his usual method of work, with the actors he took the scenes with whom he had already begun the tests before the filming. Casting was not because Garci considers it as a "muggler" and because, as he said, "the director's art is part of the theatre and the cinema walk to find out what's going on in the industry in which we work."
A number of May Blood actors, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, did not first come to his camera.
Garci - who may be proud of four Oscar nominations and one Oscar prize - believes that this year's candidates to represent Spain before the Hollywood Academy, i.e. May's Blood, the Seven French Billiards and the finally selected Blind Sunrise, do not represent the young generation of Spanish cinema, "but it should be presented," he said.
Garci does not count on prizes with this film.
“In the beginning you think you’re working for the latter and then you’re realizing that happiness is important, and you’re happy if you’re making another movie,” Garci says with a 30-year career behind him.
Isabel Bayón remembers the life and art of Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillan flamenco dancer is also a Sevillan dancer.
From the Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), Carmen Tórtola Valencia was born in the Triana district and moved to London with her parents at the age of three.
He was a free dance artist and an expert in Eastern dances.
During his moving life, he fought for women’s equality as a pioneer, whether Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and he fought against the wear of a coat that barred women’s freedom of movement.
The dance and aesthetic revolution exploded in the war in Europe, and his life caught Isabel Bayon.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gambo, and he recommended to me Thorthola, whose personality was really impressed.”
The flamenco dancer said: “Our goal is not to tell her life story, but to capture her spirit.
His dance titles are flamenco styles.
For example, from the "pillango dance" to the guajira, or from the "pillango dance" to the tango.
“I’ve been dancing sensitively and others think that’s my style,” he tells.
The light of the performance is highlighted by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda is now singing again at Isabel's performance after the Open Door; and Matilde Coral, who in this case wanted to work with a former disciple.
“Matilde shapes the older Torthola, the mature woman.
I am happy that you said yes to the request, and I am very honoured that you act in my piece.”
In addition, the production is attended by Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga music directors and guitarists, Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón singers; El Pájaro shooter, Rafa El Viola brother, and Juanfra Juárez actress who "play the real deda constantly with his love as a permanent character."
The piece also depicts the life of a woman who lives in London, but also travels to Europe, and at that time even reaches distant landscapes, including India, the United States or Italy.
“I’d like to remind him because his personality had a great impact on his age, but he’s no longer known and even less appreciated for his work today,” Bayón says.
The show begins at 20:30 p.m. in the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of the Triennium, the Diary of a Newly Married Poet will also appear.
The newly married poet's Diary will be a presentation of his first illustrated edition in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where in May 1916 Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobi. The presentation is part of a series of Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008) organized by the Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government on the 50th anniversary of the award of the Literary Nobel Prize and the anniversary of the death of both of them.
Thus, the final edition of the Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium is the re-edition of this work, the International Congress held in New York, the restoration of the Nobel Prize poet's memorial and the tour exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Bright Summer Tree". The exhibition opened in May this year, awaiting several Andalusian provinces and is scheduled to visit New York during the International Congress.
The Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government received a total of eight hundred copies of the Diary of a newly married poet, published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the reputation and work of one of the most versatile Andalusian poets.
Without Paul Newman, America is not so attractive.
“God sometimes creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was the same.”
The quotation comes from the actress Sally Field who worked with Newmann in The Victims of Sensation, and reflects the shock and impotence that Newman's death caused in American cinema and throughout America.
It was hard to get the Oscars.
He was withdrawn in 2007.
He was known to be sick.
But all of them were destroyed by his death.
"Sometimes it's unable to put our feelings into words, and I've now lost a good friend," Robert Redford said in tears, "this life has made my life and this country better."
No one was afraid that he might be laughing or overwhelming.
One of the heroes of the cinema and home has gone through a dark period, shadowed by the fear of terrorism and market conditions, the desperate search for American self-esteem and dignity.
When such difficult times pass and many people easily lose their virtues and very few people are left to look up, you don’t have to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newmant.
In the eyes of the people, the plato’s beauty and righteousness experience was presented with reality.
Richard Nixon was the formal enemy and defendant of lost and winning cases, from the drug-based foundation established in memory of the first-born son who died in drug overdose to the establishment of the home-like biofood brand.
It was a real gift to a country that was hard to overcome its suicidal nutrition culture.
The tremendous wave of admiration penetrated all over Hollywood, regardless of nationality and origin.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig says it is not a man, but an era that died with him.
Another British Oscar winner, Sam Mendes, said his joint work with Newmann was clearly the peak of his career.
Russell Crowe described Newman as his greatest inspiration.
“It has made the slope very high for all of us,” said George Clooney, who is one of the few who are trying to follow Paul Newman’s way of life today: they require honesty and serious and remote privacy.
It’s not always easy if it’s entirely possible in the middle of today’s media jungle.
However, there are those who try it, and Paul Newman is his example.
Once he divorced, but then he lived in faithful marriage for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, and there were many occasions for unfaithfulness.
“Why do I eat hamburger elsewhere when I’m waiting for cooked meat at home?” she laughed.
In heaven you may be proud that your girls on earth are also fans, which is not so common in America.
“No one of his creatures was so proud of his role as the faithful husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather, and the devote man-friend.”
The road to the Madrid Olympics
In fact, many of us dream of a Madrid Olympics, and after 2012 failed, it may be 2016 it will be.
But I ask, are we really prepared for it?
If we start the race, I think it’s not.
It was called a perfect competition, but in my view it was the worst of many I’ve ever been.
The mass of irrelevances is characterized by it, and if once it should be evaluated and I would be the examiner, it would clearly be a failure to the result.
Let’s go on and start at the beginning.
The disadvantages began with the sequence number, because therefore it had to come earlier.
This itself is not a problem yet, but if you’re going faster, at least get everything at the same time (including the chip, the post in the later row should be avoided).
It was not that happened.
First only the line number was passed (first absurdity, only that’s why I’m going there faster) and (after the usual line), how surprising it was just a S-shirt (second absurdity, because I’m just XL in my size)!
In what world are we living?
Or, because of the crisis, have they decided to save the material and just buy cheaper, small t-shirts?
But no matter what, these things are still disappearing compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having to go so early to take the chip, standing in line took 15 minutes from arrival, and even the backpack had to be handed down.
The waiting time lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race of more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race began, and we didn’t give up the backpack yet. When it finally succeeded, it was even worse.
Furthermore, the rain made the more than 40 minute waiting even more pleasant, which was driven by mass rebellion and stand-off attempts.
I think tomorrow we will get 500 certain pneumonia and some, including me, will not get our position with our actual time.
If I was asked about the perfect race, I’t remember it by chance.
So I think we can continue our dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a virtual reception
At MIT's Advanced Technologies Conference, Microsoft presented the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of - not too intelligent - artificial intelligence, which, however, is able to perform some basic tasks. For example, you can call a taxi (or, for Microsoft, a vehicle that runs within the company area) based on the information out of the conversation.
This "receptor" is able to use a camera and a shape and face recognition system to recognize how many people are in the room, who they are - even, it also notes what kind of clothes they wear - and also listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
In addition, you can group the present on the basis of conversations.
In the presentation video, the reception lady identifies a third person, but she knows that she does not belong to the company she talks with, nor is she an employee of the company.
He asks if he has come to visit someone and assures that he will take his help soon.
This is all without a blue screen.
Amazing is.
This is the music of the future.
Currently, the company has more important things, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, a lot of people said that Microsoft became a strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and contain fewer add-ons.
Steve Ballmer realized that if the computers were running only the necessary programs instead of the many commercial eyes, then the machines would be five times faster.
It was invented because Microsoft has added additional features and extra features to Windows in every new version so far.
The shift will return.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is increasingly behind, and the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I also joined the theory that Google made the first step to make Windows a competitor.
Many people correctly realized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed, as it is an essential element for the dialogue between hardware and software.
You play the same role as your wife or husband when you want to say something to your mother.
It is so.
It will never disappear, but you have to count on the "death" of the operating system, not absolute, but in a relative sense.
Ballmer's statement this week supports this idea.
People are increasingly less focused on the operating system and more on the web browser.
We only turn on the computer to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spend more time browsing than we spend in the world of windows.
What is the majority of the applications associated with the system?
Sometimes less is more.
And Windows 7 needs to be less, much less than Vista.
Less difficult, less stressed, less complex.
Microsoft’s goal is to integrate its services online and ultimately to be an alternative to Google.
I have a great need for them, and I have an example of why.
This photo was taken in a Microsoft-employed interview in Redmond in the beginning of the month.
On the slot machine, a poster calls them to use the company’s browser. – “Your browser, our future.”
In 2006, an independent survey found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to browse the internet.
Last week, the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was announced.
Not in the beginning of 2009, but in the end, rather in 2010.
Microsoft is likely to try to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The mobile phone is becoming more and more a computer.
But the slide, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely deteriorate their business.
by Le Fabuleux Marcel
This was wearing by Pablo Picasso in the Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick's Bloody Diamond, and Al Pacino in Francis Ford's Coppola Cross, as well as one of the basic clothes of the crowd of gay customers.
And if we are already on the list of specialties, we can even remember the peaceful figure of the walker circle's hardheads.
But what do we talk about?Not more than a - typically narrow and unfingerable - male cotton trick.
That’s about the “tank,” as the English is called, but with the le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, no one of his competitors can compete.
First of all, because of the elegant name – although among friends it is only referred to as “Marcel” – which is due to the sport, according to the legend, it was given its name from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel also stands out among its competitors due to its excellent cotton material, its unisex layout, its unique emblem and its small (not recognizable) Belgian flag. The latter is carried by the most characteristic models hidden in the neck of the t-shirt.
But the Belgian company is not just making tank tops.
The sports heights, retro boxers, kasmyrkardigans, wave pants, marines, babies, minisors - and we could even list - are all among the company's products.
And all belong to the category of comfortable underwear,
It is also unfortunate that you should wear them as underwear.
They are too good.
“I want to be a young mother, no matter who the father will be.”
He is very similar to his brother, but at the same time he managed to realize himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but full of energy.
Currently, the Cruz sisters want to take a more serious role in the fashion world.
For Monica, modeling means much more than some beautiful and beautiful girls give their name to something.
He was present in the promotion of Mango’s new headquarters in Paris, as well as the award of the most prestigious fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
Heat and humidity flow from it.
What do you do in Paris?
We will present the new autumn-winter collection of Mango, which we designed with my brother Penelope. In addition, we will participate in the announcement of the second 'Mango Fashion Awards' award and the gallery to celebrate Valentino in the Opera.
It’s a very intense day, it’s true, but very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango Company. Where did you get the inspiration for the new collection?
We both love the films of the 50s and 60s; from there we have taken a lot of things.
And then, many times I just go to the city and pay attention to women, how they dress, how they vary and pick up their clothes - this is one of my favorite time spending.
You are also working as a dancer, actress and fashion designer. you are a versatile woman, right?
I also think that, but in the end these three things are connected, because there are a lot of things in common.
When I was a child, I was interested in clothes, and I was hard to wait for my grandmother to go to my grandmother's clothes.
Well, it was you in the Canaan, almost up with a fun park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to my dress.
You know, we dancers love to invent our own style for classes and trials, so that we feel good when we look in the mirror.
In the role of an actress, you will really identify your role when you get the costume.
You see, everything is related to everything, and all my respect for the designers and their expertise.
Have you recently celebrated your 30th birthday?
Oh and no!
I feel better than ever, I love the 30s.
I think women really get to that time, they are already quite experienced and make fewer mistakes in life.
The biological clock is not concerned.
Since my childhood, I’m doing what I like and it fills me with great inner happiness.
Do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I’m going to be a mother because I’ve been born as a woman, and I really want to be a young mother, I don’t want to miss it at all.
As for the future father, it doesn’t matter who it will be.
I want to raise my child with great love and happiness.
Let’s say a few words about the movie. last year you’ve made several films that have not yet been shown.
Of course, and I’m hard to wait for them to come out.
I, who started in the theater, am very impatient and insecure, I want everything immediately, but of course I know that it is impossible.
I am looking forward to presenting you the last hour and the search for the grave of Christ.
I wonder what you say to them...
If I know right, you debuted a few days ago with Naomi Campbell.
No, that’s not true...
I didn’t go out as a model.
I have known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and he simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London, which he organized for his own organization, Women for a Better World. I chose two of my own Mango collections. The presented clothes were sold for sale and the amount of money was offered to the Naomi NGO.
People don’t even know how good Naomi is.
There are so many things about it, so I know, and I can make sure that half is not true.
On the other hand, I always look at the good side of your activity.
He asked for a noble case for the fashion show, but if he wanted me to stand on the head, I would do it too.
If the fate of women living in the third world is a bet, I don’t know it impossible.
Returning drunk drivers will be required to install the "Alcolock"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs would require the driver to install a structure that would prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver is drunk or does not swallow into the structure.
The proposal was submitted in June and is currently being discussed by the Prosecutor's Office, according to which the experimental project will last for a year.
Since the project is aimed at bringing it back to the market, the driver will also have to take part in a repeated course on transportation education.
In addition to the General Prosecutor's Office for Traffic Safety, the General Directorate of Transportation (DGT) and the Institute of Automotive Safety Technology Foundation (FITSA) are also involved in the experiment.
According to statistics, 30-75% of those arrested several times because of drunk driving are sitting in the car again.
This will be prevented by Alcolock, as the system connected to the vehicle determines the alcohol level of the inflated air. If it is greater than permitted, or if the driver does not inflat in the device at all, the system does not allow the vehicle to start.
The cost of an instrument of more than 1000 euros will be charged by the infringer.
A 2007 study in the U.S. showed that vehicles equipped with such instruments could reduce the number of infringements by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, the rule is estimated to save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure focuses on infringements for two reasons: on the one hand, it is easier to prevent them from becoming criminal.
On the other hand, it is easier to implement, as the legal reform is carried out in the usual manner, while the necessary criminal reform would require a basic law amendment.
The device is not yet available in any commercial form on the Spanish market, although in experimental mode it has already been installed in some industrial and public services vehicles.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which, according to the French pattern, calls for the installation of the system in school buses.
In Mexico, in closed shoes
With English accuracy, at the time announced in the program, at 17:40 a.m. the aircraft carrier of the Spanish Air Force of the Princess Party of Asturias landed in the presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was already down, but it was so burning that we could only see the royal party coming out of the aircraft using our hands as an opponent.
At the foot of the stairs were the Spanish ambassador and other prestigious personalities.
A few hours before, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew the Spanish Princess Couple is coming to the city for an official visit.
Well, it’s not going to be an airport transfer for a long time today... The woman is here or something like that...
“No, no, the lady is Spanish, she just lived here for a few years.
Yes or so...
But the Mexican press then knows everything about the Princess Couple of Asturias and the importance of their visit.
A lot of people are waiting at the airport hangar's red carpet, the corner of the 27 marines who are committed to protecting their dignities.
The prince, smiling, dressed in sea-blue clothes, and then the princess, in his long hair, falls into the wind, in shrinked clothes, but not in the usual shoes that shrink the fingers - warned that Mexico City is threatened by a storm.
For a moment they stop and smile to the cameras, and then enter the room where the official bet is held.
At the gate of their hotel - one of the four largest hotels in the city - a spokesperson of the Mexican TV is waiting for them.
The most valuable prize
A fashion award is the most suitable place in the world is undoubtedly Paris, and among today live fashion designers the most sophisticated and most cool is undoubtedly Valentino.
Mango has recently announced the second tender for the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims to bring the young talents of the fashion industry to the world.
The price is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first contest, saw her own design clothes at the Mango exhibition at Haussmann Boulevard 54 in Paris and slightly relieved from the impression.
In addition, this is the company’s second-largest European store and recently opened at 1335 square meters.
The largest store is located in London.
In the midst of the funeral event, as well as thanksgiving for Valentine's Day - for the jury's presidency - we eventually found ourselves at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
In the company of the most pleasant Chagalok, the presidential table prepared by the gas dinner Mango showed even more spectacular.
Nati, who came with hard heart and sadness due to his brother's recent death, carried one piece of the Company and some breathing sharpness of the ELAH. He carried with his son named Luis almost two meters high and accompanied Valentine to the main table of his dinner to his honor.
Andik, the owner and host of the Mango, entertained the guests. along with the baron of Rotchil, they were so riddling that they eventually remained without clothes, as they both were gifted to one-to-one lady.
Monica Cruz came to the store with her own design pants and gums, and at dinner she wore a sexy long black dress. At the night's opera visit, she was so intrigued with Gaya Toledo's company in the ballet room that, recalling the old times, she came to one of the roads and set up a grand plie variety.
Inés Sastre did not take part in the palace visit, but before him showed a few photos of his son on his mobile.
The next morning we were able to enjoy at Oliver Martinez - he was going to be two meters high and a motorcycle - and John Travolta arrived at the Intercontinental hotel in Paris. He also brought his own clothes and towels with him, and he was well predicted that he didn't ask for any smell in the room.
The stars under the star of Paris.
Oh there is, c'est la vie.
1001 is the stress number.
Not 1000, but 1000, and there’s one way to unlock the chaotic and fatious everyday lives.
Another good news is that we can find all of them in a single book that comes to the bookstores on September 30 to bring with you the rest.
It’s almost tortuous to clock at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse to think about how accelerated life is forced day by day in today’s world.
The office is called tension and the computer is back pain.
Stress is the human disease of the 21st century.
But there are no one and no two ways to overcome daily fatigue and overcome workplace problems.
This number is exactly the same as 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classical massage or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in her book so that everyone can find the most suitable and suitable solution to his free minutes.
The stress-solving work has the title of the 1001 relaxation method and the quiet flowing from it comes from the publisher Pearson Alhambra y DK to the bookstores.
If you are convinced that stress can hardly be eliminated from the world of work or personal relationships, this manual will surely sweat you in your belief.
In addition, it also serves with other ideas that all help relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to make 100% natural foods.
If your adrenaline levels are too low to refresh your body and stress becomes the central problem of your life, it’s time to get back in the chair, relax and just focus on reading.
Those Who Talk in Dreams
Some children talk at night.
I think not of those who wake up and tell them what happened to them that day, but of those who speak while they sleep.
The phenomenon may seem scary at first, but in fact it is completely harmless.
This is called somniloquism.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Some of them said they talked at night.
In terms of frequency, it can be completely rapsodic (for example, it only occurs once with a high fever disease) or more regular (one time a day, a week or a month), and usually the next day the child doesn’t remember anything.
The appearance cannot be brought back to a single cause.
It is often accompanied by other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night awakening, night sleeping (nocturna enuresis) or sleeping, but this is not legal.
As mentioned above, it can be a high fever or even a stress or an increased state of excitement.
So far, it has been less studied.
The intensity of speech is also very varied.
It can be silent, quiet, standing out of unrelated words, mourning, but unlike all these, it can also occur in the form of crying, crying, or longer speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and contact a specialist. The test can find out if there is no problem that causes great anxiety in the background and thus can offer a solution.
As mentioned above, it is a beneficial phenomenon, therefore there is no remedy for it unless it is accompanied by any other treatmentable form of sleep disorder (for example, insomnia or stress).
There are a few things we can do, here are some preventive measures:
Make sure that your child is calm before you go to bed.
Choose calming games and avoid the child watching scary or more aggressive TV shows or series.
Children with a tendency to nerve or more difficult to relax are taught some relaxation methods to make it easier for them to find inner calm.
This helps the child to sleep more calmly.
If we still start talking while we sleep, we try to keep our calm.
Remember, this is harmless for the child, and the next day they will not remember anything.
useful advice
Do not wake the child up.
It would be secondary because the child is unconscious, but would escape from sleep.
Despite speaking, he actually goes to sleep and rest.
Remember, if a strong anxiety is repeatedly accompanied by the phenomenon, it is recommended to consult a specialist or to find out what will trigger a high degree of anxiety from the child.
If you speak clearly (this is the rarest case), don’t start asking to learn anything from him.
That would be unnecessary, because while you sleep, you are not so conscious to gather your thoughts.
On the other hand, you just hear the speech, but you don’t see the dreams associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of what you hear and with possible conclusions.
Never tell the child that they can ask about his secrets at night.
Not even a joke.
This caused a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, because it’s just a few minutes of harmless episode.
Finally the Illhaeusern
After a long deep flight, the Illhaeusern team finally gained a new boost and won again on the domestic track.
Although there was no striking match, the yellow-black were put into a position several times, taking advantage of one of which they could finally win.
The rate of the match was not too tight, as the attackers had difficulty realizing the right rhythm.
The first capture shot was tried by the captain of the guest team, Kauffmann, but the remote ball just touched the top corner of the capture. Then the Illhaeusern came over and the shots followed each other: Fonderflick tried with a remote shot, then Hirn shot fell over the gate. Romain spiccel, and Diebold also tried with a remote attempt to swallow the Dannemarie defense.
On the other side, the players were compressed into a block and defended the center, and only the eternal Riahi was shot in the position.
The start of the second half was promised to be decisive: first Riahi and Temporale were positioned on the side of Dannemarie. Immediately after that the first goal was born: the ball pulling after the first shot of Diebold was obtained by the illhaeuserni Marais with an excellent position and then brought it to the gate (53 minutes).
However, the Illhausern goalkeeper could not enjoy the glory for a long time: twelve minutes later he was forced to leave the track, so his team members had to continue the struggle in human failure.
Dannemarie, on the other hand, couldn’t take advantage of it: they didn’t cause a lot of trouble to the domestic team, who just pulled a little behind to strengthen their defense.
Sarkozy Meeting with Angry Fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes an excursion to Bretagne.
Demonstrations held by fishermen on Monday disrupted the traffic of several Breton and Normandy ports. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to make a visit to the port of Le Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with representatives of the protesters.
The latter promised that the president will be welcomed "in a constructive spirit" and expressed their hopes that Sarkozy "will come with concrete proposals."
The presidential visit is just in line with the meeting of the “Crisis Committee” established by British fishermen with the aim of initiating action against the rise in oil prices, as the oil price has exceeded the record average price of 1.14 euros per liter.
President David Martinon, a spokesman for the Republic, said that the president "will negotiate with the fishermen about the solutions that could help companies recover their competitiveness and make the working conditions and wages safer for the fishermen."
The fishermen are looking forward to Nicolas Sarkozy’s arrival.
On Tuesday morning in Morbihan and Calvados districts there were massive demonstrations, which led to 10 km long torrents.
The transportation of the Quiberon Yacht Gate was also corrupted, but the roads to the Belle Island were not closed.
In the Quiberon Peninsula there were new roads.
On Monday, the sailors had already witnessed their determination. In the morning, they burned tires and boards in front of the fuel warehouses in the ports of Brescia, while protests took place in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further movements in the Atlantic Coast and other ports in La Manche. For example, in the Vendée county of Sables d'Olonne, the fishermen did not arrive on the ship, while in Le Havre, about twenty ships blocked the traffic of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Le Croisic, located in the Loire-Atlantique county, on the evening eliminated the massive Total oil refiner blockade in Donges.
Fishermen in Boulogne-sur-Mer, however, have decided to wait for a meeting in the ministry on Wednesday with a decision on further steps.
The “Crisis Committee” in Le Guilvinec will have to decide on the next step and participate in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris on Tuesday.
However, some British fishermen would not want their interests to be represented by the leaders of the National Fisheries Committee, as the Committee did not support their efforts.
“The strike continues,” because “fishermen don’t let out of their claims” and “do not want to travel to Paris,” Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee, said, for example.
Professional fishermen who do not pay tax on the gas oil are currently paying about 50 cents per liter, but they think that the operation of a ship would only become profitable if the price of the gas oil fell below 0.30 euros per liter.
The Beautiful Paul Newman
The unforgettable protagonist of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Boy" died at the age of 83, due to cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes have also honored the film legend and actress Paul Newman who died at the age of 83.
Embraer does not change its 2008 shipping plans
Despite the threat to the world economy, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, is able to keep the plans and plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, chairman of the company.
In the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer has a great deal of interest in the Chinese market, especially with regard to its 30-120 seat aircraft.
In the last eight years, Embraer has delivered a total of 41 aircraft to Chinese customers.
AIG will sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group will sell more than 15% of its assets in order to reimburse its $85 billion, according to the Financial Times.
In addition to its international life insurance and U.S. retirement insurance activities, AIG would be separated from almost every other business, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the case.
According to the Times, the Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to examine the possibilities of sale.
AIG has not confirmed this information.
The assets to be sold by AIG include the aircraft leasing company International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share in the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurance company, as well as its real estate portfolio and private capital investments.
According to the report, there is no final decision regarding the sale.
AIG has to quickly get to liquid assets to reimburse the $85 billion loan approved by the U.S. government, taking the risk that even 80% of its capital will fall away and will lose its shareholders in the same proportion.
Paris Historique Study of Morning Meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange a historic decline on Monday after the Senate rejected Paulson's bank rescue plan. Dow Jones index dropped by 6.98% (which has never seen a decline of 800 points) and Nasdaq by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) dropped by 777.68 points and closed by 10 365.45 points.
The index has recorded its biggest decline (684.81 points) on September 17, 2001, when the trade began again after the terrorist attack on September 11.
Nasdaq, mainly based on technological papers, was closed with a decline of 199,61 points at 1 983,73 points, while the Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index dropped by 8,81% (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1 106,55 points according to official closing data.
The Wall Street stock exchange was weakened when it opened, and when the Senate unexpectedly rejected the bank rescue plan to restore market balance, it began to float deep.
Deputies with 228 “no” votes, 205 “no” against, refused to provide funds requested by finance minister Henry Paulson.
Approximately two-thirds of the Republicans voted for the plan.
“The market has filed bad signals from this because it seems that Congress is unable to approve a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza, an analyst at FTN Financial.
“It also shows how much the market was waiting for this plan,” he added, expressing concerns about the fact that if a plan was adopted a few days later, it would be “too late.”
“If the plan is indeed sentenced to death (...), then the Fed and other central banks will be on track to deal with the crisis and the credit conditions will continue to strengthen,” warns Brian Bethune, Global Insight’s chief economist.
In order to increase the feeling of urgency further, Piegza adds: "Every day a new and a new financial institution goes bankrupt" in the United States.
After the Washington Mutual bankruptcy on Friday, the authorities made sure that Wachovia’s banks were purchased by its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, making urgent measures necessary to rescue banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux states, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market has "not only developed an American, but a global crisis," adds FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has grown significantly.
The 10-year-old bond revenue dropped from 3,827% to 3,632% on Friday night, while the 30-year-old dropped from 4,357% on the previous day to 4,161% on Friday night.
Obama wins the first television dialogue
The two U.S. presidential candidates on Friday, their first debate followed by a further debate that had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would leave the dialogue as a winner.
Not surprisingly, both Republican and Democratic campaign officials have declared themselves the victory in the television dialogue that one-third of the U.S. households watched.
Political analyst David Gergen says that although John McCain's actions were respectful, it did not prove to be "disappointing" enough to stop his decline in popularity: this is proven by a five-week survey before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democratic candidate is better in the struggle: a public opinion survey published on Saturday found that Obama has a five-point advantage over McCain (44% and 49%).
Among the most counting, still undefined voters, 39% of respondents said Obama would win, while 25% expect McCain to win, according to a CBS survey.
Obama is expected to further increase his advantage with the promising Thursday role of his party counterpart, Joseph Biden. Biden is preparing for his first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
But Bill Clinton warned this weekend: “It would be a mistake to underestimate Palin.
They have good feelings.”
McCain, who was in his seventy years, never fails to put his own, undisputedly enormous foreign policy experience in the forefront. In addition, he emphasizes his opponent's "naivity" in these issues that were the center of their first personal meeting.
“It seems Obama senator doesn’t understand that...” – he said several times the attack.
"I don't think Obama's Senator has the experience and knowledge necessary for the presidency," McCain said.
This is the main attack interface that is exploited by the Republican TV ads running since yesterday.
Obama, however, emphasized that he represents the future.
He didn’t let himself be disturbed: he talked together and accurately.
He emphasized his ability to make good decisions and restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain still doesn’t understand, but Obama is already doing,” a Democratic announcement released this weekend, which tells the Republican leader that he has not yet measured the impact of the crisis on the U.S. “road people.”
“In the nine-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said to 20,000 people who gathered in the rain in North Carolina.
The confusing situation in the financial world is undoubtedly favorable to Obama, who the Americans consider the most suitable to save the economy on the edge of the collapse.
“The future may be seven turning points,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, one of the veterans of the Clinton administration, said Obama had "an excellent incentive in the economy" like Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
In the eyes of the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is "the final judgment over the eight-year bad economic policy created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain."
The Senator of Illinois reaffirmed that despite the shifts in the stock exchange, it will be able to reduce the tax burden of 95% of Americans. he added that his primary objectives include creating the country's potential energy independence through the use of renewable energy sources, as well as developing a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates carefully avoided the issues related to the $700 billion (470 billion) bank rescue plan: the extremely unpopular plan was approved by Congress yesterday evening.
Minszk: “You noticed that there was a election here?”
Youth and opposition protested on Sunday night in the capital of Belarus to reject the expected result of the parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, after the closure of the voting rooms, hundreds of Belarusians gathered in the main square of Minsk to protest against the falsification of the election results.
Although results have not yet been published, a number of young people protested against President Alexander Lukashenko with the following words: "Dictator, give up!".
Some admit that they didn’t even go to vote: “Why would I have gone? so they do with my vote what they want!” – says a young man.
Demonstrators do not believe that the regime, which has tried to demonstrate itself in good shape before foreign observers in order to build relations with the European Union, would be ready for a democratic system change.
If the elections were considered clear by the observers, they would be able to dissolve the country's sanctions, in the framework of which 40 White-Russian leaders were denied visa and some bank accounts were frozen.
The opposition said the elections were not clear.
“We were kept away from the election committees and our observers were unable to participate in the voting,” said Jurij Potyemkin, a spokesman for the united Democratic Forces coalition, organized by the twelve parties.
“The changes were merely nominal,” said Aleksandr Milinkievich, the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and the leader of the pro-European movement.
If opposition ambassadors enter parliament, it means they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament will enable them to get a place on television, to meet in the regions of the country and to submit legislative proposals.
The opposition, therefore, has to move in the political life, because “the dialogue with the European Union has to be initiated.”
In fact, if our economy, which is seriously liable to Russia, is in a crisis and we are unable to renew, we are at risk of falling under the jurisdiction of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition is concerned that the European Security and Cooperation Organization, which is monitoring the election process, will accept the result of the vote as valid.
They emphasize that the participation rate seems too high, and the broad organization of the preliminary vote (in which 26% of voters in Minsk participated) gave the opportunity to any manipulation.
“You noticed that there were elections here?” asks the social-democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, who was for the last time released from prison in August, where he was held as a political prisoner.
There was no one in the voting rooms.
There will be no more than five opposition representatives in the parliament, the ones that are best suited to the leadership.
In October, the night is still silent.
On television, President Lukasenko and members of the Central Election Committee are pleased to succeed.
Blood is safe again.
Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday. President Dr. Francine Décary was a good reason to celebrate because Héma-Québec has now become one of the world’s safest and most effective blood donor companies.
And most importantly, it has managed to restore people’s confidence, which has been severely damaged by the impact of the scandal about the infected blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national reserve of blood treated by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Supplier Service was infected with the acquired immunodeficiency symptoms (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
After the drama and the general devastation, the Canadian government launched an official investigation in February 1994 under the leadership of Judge Horace Krever, with the aim of revealing the circumstances that led to the tragedy and making proposals to avoid future similar cases.
While Krever judge was delayed by submitting his report, some provinces set up their own committee aimed at designing a new blood treatment system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this task.
According to the Gélineau and Krever reports, two blood supply services have been established in Canada: one is Héma-Quebec, which serves Quebec, and the other is the Canadian Blood Supply Company, which is responsible for all other provinces and the two territories.
“When Héma-Québec started its activity in 1998, just 38% of people had confidence in the blood supply system in Québec,” recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was desperate.
“In the coming years, however, the improvement of the safety of blood preparations and our work in the area have succeeded in regaining people’s confidence,” Decary proudly states that at the beginning of 2008, 94% of Quebec’s population considered Héma-Quebec reliable.
However, Dr. Decary doesn’t forget that “confidence is an extremely fragile thing.”
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the principle of caution.
During this period, a number of cases have been discovered in Europe when a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease infected people, says the doctor, who has managed the company since its founding in 1998.
"We didn't know if this disease spreads through blood.
Therefore, we rely on one of the most important recommendations in the Krever and Gélineau reports. According to this, if we are uncertain about this and there is a risk of developing a serious disease, then we need to take exclusive measures. In this case, it was about the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which causes a brain damage, which inevitably leads to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not receive blood from people who have spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
And a few years ago, any doubt was found that the disease spread through the blood.
This case convinced us that it was reasonable to apply the principle of caution.”
This is a nucleic acid test (NAT), which is able to directly detect the virus in the blood of donors, rather than the antibodies that form against the virus, on which the previously used tests were built.
With the help of the NAT test, we could shorten the window period, which lasts from infection until we can detect the virus in the blood with the help of our technical tools, the specialist explains.
This period could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, the risk of an unknown blood donor to infect the blood supply was significantly reduced and that this could not be detected.
These developments have significantly reduced the risk of the spread of AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, the risk of getting a person infected with HIV is 12 million per one.
In other words, this means that we should allocate 12 million blood clots until someone is infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes 400-500 thousand blood prescriptions each year, more than 24 years should take for such a case to occur and someone to get infected with HIV through a blood prescriptions.
I think today anyone can calmly accept or prescribe a blood transfusion in order to restore your health, says Héma-Québec's number one leader.
“The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We can never know what new pathogens will enter the system.
For it was only last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, passed into the blood with insects.
That’s why we have to be constantly in the gap,” continued Dr. Décary, and then emphasized that in addition to the digestive reserves, Héma-Quebec needs to provide sufficient permanent reserves.
“As the population ages, the demand is increasing.
Since anti-cancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need red blood cells or blood plates to be replaced.
The ageing population also affects the blood donor stock, as the number of people in the network who are able to donate blood accounts for only 3% of the Quebec population.
However, any healthy person, at least 18 years of age, who meets the conditions of aptitude may donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of applicants don’t receive blood because they have been infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have visited a country where malaria is destroyed have no right to donate blood for a year.
“These 3% of our reserves are sufficient to meet the needs of hospitals.
It is very rare that we get out of stocks.
The number of donors of blood, however, should be increased as the existing people are aging, because they can no longer donate blood after a while.
But it’s very difficult to convince people to give blood, but it’s even more difficult to keep them and push them to become regular blood donors.
In this fasting world today, one man has hardly an hour to go to give blood,” Francis Decary says.
Héma-Québec, which has an annual budget of $297 million, provides not only blood preparations, but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heart keys, eye ball tissues and skin tissues, which are used almost exclusively for people with severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen, and then placed at Héma-Québec, which at the same time manages the only public stem cell bank in Québec.
A blood that is rich in stem cells can be obtained from the bladder, which is only treated as a medical waste, allowing the treatment of severe diseases (such as leukemia).
“A few weeks ago we celebrated the entrance of the millennial tubular blood sample to our bank, and we are planning to take over a thousand new samples each year.
At the beginning of the next year, we will probably begin to offer these for organ transplants,” said Dr. Décary, who said the pulmonary blood transfusion program is very popular today.
“Many mothers are sad that they don’t have the opportunity to do this,” he said, “it’s true because Héma-Quebec is unable to make this complex and expensive program available in all hospitals in Quebec.
Football: The Impact in the Final
The Montreal Impact team yesterday defeated Seattle Sounderst by 3:1 in the USL-1 defeat and entered the final with a total 4:3 score. This was the second quarter-final and a crucial match for the total results held at the Saputo stadium.
The final goal was won by Antonio Ribeiro in the 90th minute of the match.
While the first half passed without a goal, in the second, the two midfielder of the Montreal team, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, also found the opponent's network.
Only Roger Levesque from the Sounders team managed to escape Matt Jordan's gate.
Remember that on Friday's first match, the Impact lost 2-1 against the Starfire Complex in Tukville, Seattle.
In the final, Impact will play with Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder team, which in the first match scored 3:1 against Whitecap, won by 4:3 but in the pre-final, Whitecaps arrived with a total score of 5:4 in the first match.
Impact is expected to meet with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the matches will be clarified today.
The Winner of Kovalev
Canadiens' favourite trias is preparing for the next season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led three great attacks, and eventually Canadiens won against Florida Panthers in a 3:2 ratio of penalties yesterday night at Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal. Plekanec scored two and Kovalev scored a goal pass, which was the fourth victory of the team's six preparation matches.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who won the single goal of the breakdown.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian player warns.
“There’s another match to make me feel really in shape.”
"He tried to get too much out of himself in the first quarter," said Guy Carbonneau.
“I think I was happy with the end of the match.
He had a huge ovation.”
The Northern aspirations of Charest
The Prime Minister says the election will begin this year.
As the meeting of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest was on a trip to Quebec’s Jean-Talon, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left) triumphed in the middle election today.
"To shrink our last great northern border": this ambitious long-term goal was formulated by Jean Charest at the last meeting of the Quebec Liberal Party in Levis. The speech was also enriched with visual elements, while the president tried to focus on the essence.
During his performance, behind his back were displayed images similar to "Moulin à images".
The three enormous photographs followed each other: water blocks, mining, Quebec on Google Maps, maps...
These tools are used during elections.
The Prime Minister was not willing to guarantee that the elections will not begin this autumn, though he added that his timing was too tight.
The “Western Plan” is the fourth pillar of the “vision” of the prime minister on the future of Quebec, which is embedded in a “new economic zone” which includes a labour agreement to be concluded with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and several agreements planned with Ontario.
Recently, the opening to the North (i.e. the northern area starting at the 49th width degree) was often included in the Prime Minister's speeches, but he has never made a speeche on this topic.
The head of state, however, was only to explain why he considered the North “a treasure mining full of enormous possibilities,” but he did not talk about the factor of time, the amount of investment, or the specific order of importance for future projects.
It has raised only a few opportunities for development: mainly water power plants, forestry, and especially mining, which is further encouraged by the growth of the countries in the shutdown and the rebuilding of public infrastructure.
“Nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds,” Charest said.
This territory, which is "two times as large as France", is our territory, the territory of Quebec.
It’s not only in us, it’s in us,” he said, stressing that he intends to create a national founder myth.
He emphasized that the development of Quebec was largely determined by the relationship with the North: the golden fever in Abitib, the Quebec design work, the James Bay...
“This is our, our future!” he added, after taking a stage break, he scored a huge map behind his back.
The north, which occupies 70% of the territory of Quebec, includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded for itself, the Prime Minister said at a press conference.
“This is our historic resolution, which has been confirmed by all governments.
“There is a border line that has long been without any agreement, and if there is an opportunity, I will reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the government,” he said.
On the other hand, "in the light of climate change, we need to re-think our view on the North," the Prime Minister said, speaking of the Northwest Crossing, which is opened every year as a result of the irrigation of the arc ice.
In this new geopolitical environment, the occupation of the territory is an important task.
And what will happen to the indigenous inhabitants of the territory, the Indians and the Eskimans?
He said that the government of Quebec is paying special attention to them and that the plan will bring a lot of benefits to them, especially to the young people.
The two ministers of the various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (the latter was an Envoy of the Parti Québécois in Hungary) have already started the talks with about thirty local communities.
The Inter-Ministry Committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Ministry of Transport and Natural Resources) also plays an important role.
The head of government does not exclude the possibility of a large-scale meeting, "not necessarily a summit" where they "create a common vision."
The development of the North would otherwise be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, in-systemed and at the same time environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as that is in line with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers before him.
“As the former liberals, we think differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from the challenges.”
This was one of the returning topics of the weekend that began on Friday with a big cocktail party celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's election to the party.
One of the adopted decisions suggests the Beauharnois power plant to be crossed into the Adélard-Godbout gate.
“The politicians of our party, including Godbout, the founder of Hydro-Quebec, Lesage, the quiet revolution and the nationwide dissemination of hydroelectric power plants, or Bourassa, known as the father of the Bay of James, all knew how to pursue the future,” Jean Charest said.
In the press conference he quoted another - true, conservative - work, namely John Diefenbaker, the program "Roads to the North" of the Prime Minister between 1957 and 1963.
With regard to the plan for the blockade of the Eastmain1a-Ruper water plant, President Charest emphasized that the launch is planned for 2012.
"It will remain among us, but I'm planning to be there," he told his believers, and his statement was accepted by a loud tapsvihar.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there will be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not exclude the possibility of a vote in the autumn of this year, which the law allows him.
However, he emphasized that the calendar is already full, as he took tasks at the Federal Council meeting in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The party assembly held at the end of the week turned out to be an excellent platform for the liberal president to interpret nationalist decisions, which were approved almost without thought. Here it is mainly about "legislative efforts": the liberal party requires the recognition of the "specific nature of Quebec" in the Constitution.
I would also want Quebec to be able to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council, and these members would have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition, however, accepted the main points of the Northern Plan with skepticity.
The party leader of Quebec, Paulina Marois, re-established the North Quebec development policy, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, refused to apply this policy.
If they didn’t, “today we’d be far ahead,” Marois said in an agreement with Françoise Mercure, who was initiated as a candidate for the Jean-Talon vote today.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government’s acceptance of the Northern Plan.
"We, however, want it not to be a simple play," said Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, who returned from his release today.
Posts Tagged: a destroyed country
Vic Toews, the Minister of the Harper Cabinet (also the "Justice" Minister) took the courage last summer to call Louise Arbourt a "shame" of Canada.
Thus, dishonoring a woman who has continually struggled for the truth and deserves all of our admirations - it tells a lot about the people around the prime minister and about himself as well as Stephen Harper.
This is our government, which has not brought home its own citizens from the Guantanamo concentration camp, one of the Western countries concerned.
This is the government that absolutely does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was still a teenager at the time of the crimes committed by him.
This is the only government that, despite Canada’s signature of the Geneva Convention, has rejected its word and allows a child soldier to scroll in unhuman circumstances.
The only government that makes a puppy theatre from the court while investigating the guilt of an accused.
The UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers’ Alliance are also calling for Omar Khadr’s return to Canada in order for him to receive a fair trial in Canada.
And our government is looking at torture: it doesn’t care that a young adult is mentally completely destroyed, and the many years of torture is likely to have restored his fate for a lifetime.
Although we are not aware of this yet, our rights, freedoms, and democracy are underway to be destroyed. “Democracy”: Harper continuously speaks this word that sounds like a simple empty speech from his mouth.
Therefore, the time has come when there is no more morality: they can voluntarily beat, torture and imprison any Canadian citizen according to the desire of a leader of a government that has so far been in a minority (and what can happen after October 14...?).
Many voters believe that he can find salvation in a party that glorifies Virtue, Law and Order. They don't see that this government stumbles the values to which our country has given the good news and dignity.
Dear Mr. Toews, it’s a shame for you – don’t look for it anywhere else.
Review of Barrick Gold Orwell's Speech
In the Le Devoir number of September 17, a letter was published from Patrick J. Garvert, Deputy Chairman of the Canadian Barrick Gold Count.
According to Orwell’s statement, Garver says the world’s largest gold producer has launched a $6 million grief lawsuit against three authors and a small-money publishing company in order to initiate a so-called “public debate”.
Though judges are independent and impartial, their decisions, especially in the trial cases, are made not on the basis of truth, but on the basis of law.
It is not surprising that Garver was listening deeply about this fundamental difference.
For Barrick Gold, would it really be the best way for a public debate to destroy anyone whose position is contrary to his?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada must spend significant amounts on defence and struggle in an unfair struggle where, on the other hand, there is an army of lawyers supported by almost untouchable resources in the mining industry.
In such an inequal struggle, otherwise, the tactic is often applied to destroy the defendant and make a friendly agreement, which not only silence the opponents, but even frighten those who will try to deal with the matter again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he would have had to express his opinions before the public.
While in many other countries where Barrick Gold operates, it’s different, in Canada, the disputing parties generally don’t bite each other but speak their thoughts.
The mining would therefore have been enough to open its books and dossiers, and to prepare for a real debate in the press, the media, the publications, paying for independent research groups that could have revealed the question.
But it seems that Barrick Gold is unreliable to the public and with a move disrupts requests and letters written to protect the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr. Garver explain how he could initiate a “public” debate, while at the same time neglecting the public’s opinion?
In the Vice-President’s mind, this word is likely to mean just the taxpayed lawyers, not the total population of Canada: the meaning of the concept is thus a little downward.
In a democratic state there is freedom of speech for even the disgraceers of others.
Barrick Gold, on the other hand, doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – that the authors and publishers of Noir Canada are mainly supported by the public because they condemn the brutal method of their torment.
The public is ready to listen to Barrick and make a judgment, but it would do so on the basis of civilized arguments, rather than by a trial that would rather be silent for many. (In the context of the term "public debate", Barrick Gold has recently written to the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using this term.)
In addition to Garver’s surreal discourse, the Barrick Gold process is an open attack on the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which is the buildings of every democratic society.
As a whole, the procedure denies the right to quote authentic sources, something to debate the facts and their interpretation that are the basis of intellectual activities.
If in a country like Canada you can only study and discuss topics that don’t like the rich companies of today’s world, will you take the courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, it could do so according to the scientific standards applied by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have the right to answer.
In our university, we have been able to deal with disputes, differences and conflicts for a long time.
Barrick Gold’s unthinkable procedure clearly shows that, unlike his claims, he is not willing to continue an open debate.
This is a loss for both the world of universities and the institution of public debates in Canada. It is time for governments to implement measures to limit legal proceedings for such abuse.
Wall Street rescue action: Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush government and the Republican and Democratic leaders of Congress have finally reached an agreement on the economic rescue action, which is the biggest plan since the great world economic crisis in the 1930s.
The $700 billion plan, aimed at mitigating the financial crisis on Wall Street for months, is still to be approved by the two House of Congress.
The key points of the plan are: more effective monitoring of the implementation by the representatives; new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the state funds provided; new provisions to maintain the number of houses booked due to the lack of payments; the right of insight into the payments to the managers of the undertakings assisted.
Henry Paulson, U.S. Secretary of Finance, Nancy Pelosi, President of the House of Representatives and Judd Gregg, the Republican representative participating in the talks yesterday, a few minutes before midnight, announced the good news after the two-day marathon talks ended.
“We’ve made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively on the markets,” said Henry Paulson, a representative for the Bush government.
“We did everything with the aim of saving the real economy and the American citizens from the current Wall Street crisis,” the Democrat said.
“The most important point is that if we don’t do this, the shock, chaos and confusion in the everyday lives of the Americans will be huge,” Judd Gregg said.
The negotiations have been accelerated in the last few hours, fearing that another failure would have a negative impact on the mood of investors.
The stock market had a deadline until opening this morning.
The two presidential candidates who came late to the talks showed themselves ready to reach a deal, but they said they were not happy that the situation was worsening to the end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama attributed to himself the extension of the agreement to elements such as provisions relating to the preservation of households or the payments to the leaders of companies assisted by the state.
“When we ask taxpayers to take some extraordinary actions because of the irresponsibility of other people, it’s not so pleasant.
These steps, however, are necessary,” he said in a US television show.
When his opponent, John McCain, was asked by another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, he replied, "I would like to know the details, but I hope that yes."
“What I’ve read in big lines, it’s already seen that it’s a thing that we all have to digest and through which we can move forward.
The possibility of not doing anything is simply unacceptable,” he said.
According to the $700 billion plan, taxpayers will buy from the money of suspicious claims from U.S. financial institutions, something risky, unsellable assets.
This first led to the collapse of risky real estate loans (secondary mortgage loans) and then spread to other (commercial) securities that incorporate credit relations, and eventually caused the freezing of liquid resources and the disintegration of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft agreement was defeated by a group of Republican members last week.
It seems that we’ve managed to get out of this trap since the Democrats agreed that certain “toxic” assets of companies in difficult situations would rather be provided by the government rather than purchased.
In order to ensure that all members of Congress are satisfied, the plan also includes a provision that requires that if the government has to bear the losses under the program for five years, it may impose new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, a $250 billion deal will be paid first, followed by another $100 billion if the president considers it necessary.
The remaining $350 billion will be voted by Congress.
In exchange for the aid, Washington gains shares in the supported companies, through which it receives dividends from the profits and which it can sell after the crisis is relieved.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the reservation of properties covering the mortgage loans covered in the plan. In addition, it will be able to set the maximum wage and final compensation to be paid to the managers of the undertakings affected by the crisis.
The proposals will be voted by the House of Representatives today and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite their efforts, however, it is still uncertain that the plan will be approved.
There were repeated statements against the plan among both Republicans and Democrats.
“It is clear that Washington will not hear your voice,” Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House’s financial committee, said in a statement.
“We have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is no one that will benefit taxpayers.”
Brad Sherman, a democratic representative leading a small congressional group called a "skeptic group", shows things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred outstanding economists, including three Nobel prize winners, have written to us to ask Congress not to rush and to thoroughly examine which way they choose,” Sherman said.
In Europe, at the same time, it was again understood that this is a global crisis.
After a crisis meeting, the three Benelux states announced that they would state a part of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion U.S. dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy its competitor on the edge of bankruptcy after losing €2 million ($2.9 billion) as a result of the U.S. secondary mortgage crisis.
With 85,000 employees, Fortis is one of the 20 largest banks in Europe and one of the 10 largest insurance companies.
“It’s not a throw of money,” Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos said.
In return, we have the right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what depositors and households are appreciating now that the situation promises uncertain.”
Meanwhile, on the outskirts of La Manche, the British government seems to be preparing to nationalize a new bank that is overwhelmed by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over the total of Bradford and Bringley bank’s ongoing loans, of which real estate loans amount to £41 billion ($75,5 billion).
The Spanish Santander bank announced yesterday that it will buy the British bank’s subsidiaries and customer stocks.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalized by the British government since the beginning of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Goodbye to the Actor's Miracle
His beautiful Azur-blue eyes were, in some, his main touch card, and in others, his main weakness.
Did the American actor ever get rid of the Narcissus mirror?
Yes, and not too.
Through his shame, his sensitivity, and his congenital talents, he was also distant from the style of grace, which is the creation of the real great monsters of the world of art.
What a huge path it has gone.
Paul Newman died of lung cancer at the age of 83, on Friday in his possession of Connecticut. He was one of the last icons of the American cinema flower age.
There was less monumental individuality than Brando, whom he looked like, and who for a long time was considered a competitor on the film. In his roles he was more confused and undoubtedly more vulnerable, but he also announced freedom and the destruction of the dramatic conventions.
From the blend of the blood often emerges extraordinary children.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio as a child of a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
The European roots contributed to the birth of one of the symbolic shapes of the American dream.
He didn’t think too much about himself, which just increased his merits.
In the 1950s, he studied at the Yale University in a dramatic stage and then at the Actor's Studio in New York, before invading the theatre, television and shortly later into the cinema world.
In addition to being a warrior for civil rights, he won the second place as a car racer in 1979 in the Le Mans 24-hour race. In addition, he was considered a sex symbol, although he has been happy married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we can never know what the shadows were to the life of this mysterious, closed, dedicated to his work actor who hated the glow of the show-business.
He was a genuine man in the greatest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death at the end of the week shocked filmmakers: his great roles can be seen only on the black screen of memories.
It is the seventh American art, which has been continuously changing for more than fifty years.
Our memory is mixed with the sweet cowboy of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Boy" (1969) and a cool young man from his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor), whose role was seen in the 1958 Tennessee Williams processing "The Cat on the Hot Baptist".
From recent times (1990) in the image of the sensitive Mr. Bridge, we can remember him who faces an old age with the fact that his marriage has not replaced his hopes.
Paul Newmann has seen many other faces in his films.
In Robert Wise's film "Someone Up" the unforgettable role of the stormy life of the criminal-broker, Rocky Graziano. This role originally intended for James Dean - and took over after his death - started Newman's acting career in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in the brilliant work "The Great Dwarf", which in 1973 won an Oscar for Best Film.
In his genius film "The Swindler" (1961), Robert Rossen played a disappointed, revengeable billard player and returned to a similar role in Martin Scorsese's film "The Color of Money".
Changing times, but always the same face: it was him.
It has always been so.
His career period was marked by periods of change.
The younger people are known mostly from George Roy Hill's cult film "Ice Thieves" (1977), where Reggie Dunlop, a coach of a ice hockey team, works with uncommon methods.
His fans were seen in the "The Great Jump" recorded by Coen Brothers in 1994.
The series was closed by Sam Mendes's 2003 film "The Way of Punishment", which was the last appearance in the role of an Irish mafia leader.
Unlike many film legends who relatively quickly left the film, Newman remained in the reflector light for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood along with its glowing, brightness and hypocrisy.
The French film director Bertrand Tavernier did not consider it without all humour as a "live denial of subjugation": he believed his play was too powerful.
The profession, however, was not always kind with the beautiful Paul Newmann, whose long-time film roles just fell into the dead.
Nevertheless, he rarely played young and successful characters: rather, he formed figures living on the roof of society - nervous, alcoholic, malicious or hopeless - whose kidnapping and rebellion he could return with perfect authenticity.
As a director, Newman showed a fewer-known face: in the depths of his soul his truly eye-mighty and sensitive man.
In the 1968 film "Rachel, Rachel" (which is an adaptation to the novel of the Canadian writer Margaret Laurence) with her wife, Joanne Woodward, in the main role she painted a delicate portrait of a melancholic woman.
The 1984 film “Harry and his son” remembers his son, Scott, who died from a drug overdose.
His close friend and old warrior, Robert Redford (with whom they played in "The Big Doll" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Boy") said: "His presence made my life and the world better.
A generousness and the joy of being: that was the secret of the vibrant individuality of this great actor that we have now lost.
In addition to his legendary career, his criticism of civil rights, the struggle for the environment, the independence of filmmaking and the Hollywood defeats is overwhelmed.
Many times we could see his picture smiling on the packaging of potatoes, sauces, biscuits and other foods. He did it with a pretty bad mouth, although at the beginning he still thought it was funny.
However, the income from such sales has always been transferred to the foundation established for children suffering from the disease.
Newman was never sitting on his bowls: he was committed to his profession all the time.
In his left letter to his five daughters, he wrote: "Your father was always and always incredibly grateful for his fortune.
It was a privilege for me to be here.”
It is also a privilege for us to be able to accompany the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a citizen, above all.
What is produced in Zuschlag & Tsai Factory?
Soon, on October 8, the criminal proceedings against John Zuschlag and his colleagues will begin.
The politician and his colleagues are accused of continuously and commercially committed fraud and other crimes, including falsification of documents, causing significant damage.
According to the prosecutor’s statement, the funds received were used for their own purposes, and the performance of the tasks was often confirmed by false accounts.
State and municipal funds - a total of approximately 65 million forint - were partially transferred to the Youth Left's cash and partially to some people's pockets.
The method described by the investigative authority was that the winning tender funds were collected on the basis of cost accounts behind which there was no actual fulfilment and the associations never fulfilled the commitment undertaken.
A majority of the accounts were false.
For these, the bills were acquired in the Yoseph City market, and the circles were manufactured in Kiskunhalason.
And for the name of which companies the accounting was produced, among other things, it was on the Balaton-Overseas Circuit to which John Zuschlag sent Lados István.
The latter said he had to look at pensions and restaurants.
He requested an invoice for the consumption there, for the example of which the invoices to be submitted were prepared, among other things, by the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Social and Labour Board and the Capital Municipality.
Most of these were noted by Lados István with his colleague, Guardians András, who, according to our information, wrote the reports most necessary to obtain the grants.
One of the "study routes" of Lados was a beer house.
According to two accounts issued by the Zuschlagek in 2003, the hostel provided the dining for a group of nine members of the Biztos Pont Association.
However, so many, according to the head of the company, would not have entered the hostel at the same time.
Similarly, the bill issued to the Foundation for a Better Future – later Together for the Third Millennium – in the summer of 2002 was removed from form and content errors.
There were only three rooms in a bathroom, more than ten people were unable to sleep in one night, but the account was about a hundred and thirty guests.
But the imaginative forms were overwhelmed even when they marked the Pigal Kft., which also deals with hospitality, whose accounting - according to the information given to the prosecutor's office - was not included in the documents for the better future and the name of Hoppá.
The company’s chief, Wolkas Györző, told hvg.hu that when he was called to the prosecutor’s office and showed his bills, he immediately knew it was false documents.
"On the labelling, the name of our company and our tax number were listed in the wrong place."
He added: Beyond formal reasons, it was not true that according to the bill, hundreds of people were accommodated, because they have a total of eleven rooms in which there is not so much room.
In addition, the bill was also for meals, while their restaurant has long been unfunctional.
The enthusiastic accounting makers did not follow the fact that the Budapest travel agency they looked at organized only foreign trips, so they indicated a broken Hungary trip as a service on the cash payment account, which was also uncompatible with the company’s account issuance practice.
Furthermore, as the investigation revealed, the VAT was also included in the document, although travel activities to countries outside the European Union were VAT-free.
Among other things, the VAT rate was erroneous in the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the better future, since the service of the company is not charged by the indicated VAT of 25, but 15 per cent, in addition, the staff of the hotel only issued a machine account, the made account was handmade.
Furthermore, the “exhibitors” also broke their accounts with the fact that, in the case of a company, road shipping was marked as an activity carried out – it was revealed through the prosecution procedure – which the company based on originally investment advice did not carry out.
Furthermore, there were also subjective deviations — not adequate account format, not real sign — that the accounts of the Joint for the Third Millennium Foundation, the 21st Century Cultural Association and the Secure Point were false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértói Sporttábor, whose representatives denied that the accounts were issued by them.
The counterfeiters did not notice, for example, that the HIB Kft. was under liquidation at the time (2001), when the group of the Association for the Young City ate there, and that’s why the company’s liquidation officer – as we know – also denied that he would have issued the paper.
Consciously established
Another group of accounts issuers is made up of those who were aware of the need to issue a fictitious account.
At the request of the Youth Left-Young Socialists, the Foundation for Opportunity Budapest issued a bill for the Joint Third Millennium Foundation for approximately four million forint.
The head of Collab Kft. - according to the allegation - was arrested by one of the accused, Györfi Ludovic, to issue the fictional account.
He also collaborated with Zuschlagek the Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation, which in 2003 sold the Foundation for a Better Future, the Atlas Association and the Red Tree Association with accounts exhibited for a durely value of five million forint, behind which there was no real economic activity.
It is not a money movement because the accounts were then deposited, but the organizations have forgotten to include this in their documents.
The next group of companies issuing the invoice belongs to those that may be bound to the accused.
Thus, the delivery officer of the Ukrainian CEO of the fuel and motor vehicles trade, based in Budapest, although not located there, was Kubatov Ivan.
The company also issued several accounts on the sale of computer devices in October, November and December 2005, worth approximately 18 million forint.
According to the investigation, these accounts were purchased by Cash Investment Kft., which is under liquidation since September 14, 2005.
The company was managed by a Romanian man, to whom Kubatov Ivan would have been handed over documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
As we know, during the investigation Kubatov acknowledged that he issued accounts for Atlas, Hopp and the Joint Foundation for the Third Millennium on behalf of the Kft.
On the request of Kubatov Ivan, the Romanian miners founded the Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt.
However, in fact, no company was operating, which the accused said was the reason they did not get a job.
However, he took advantage of the companies because at the request of his accused colleague, the lawyer St. Zsolt, who made the founding papers of the companies, he issued accounts on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with Zuschlag: Atlas and Y-Generation.
In the name of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave the organizations a total of 15 accounts worth 14.2 million forint.
The prosecutor's opinion was that 10 percent of the amounts on the accounts and the VAT hit Kubatov mark.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. to exhibit fictional accounts, which were produced for the Biztos Point application.
In January 2006, Y-Generation and the Alliance for Modern Hungary submitted an application to the Socialist Party’s public benefit organization, the Táncsics Mihály Foundation (TMA).
They also won 500-500 thousand forums, but the amounts were not devoted to the purposes indicated in the tender.
To avoid this, five fictitious accounts received from Works Team Kft. have been submitted to TMA.
These accounts were found during a home search in Kemecsei Árpád’s office near the educational portfolio.
During the trial, some of the accused, as the prosecutor’s office did, are likely to report the process of accounting.
Interestingly, if the first-class accused himself, John Zuschlag decides to appeal for everything.
His testimony has not yet been very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised that he will talk about everything, he has not yet done that.
The question is, whether it is for this purpose, the socialists have made a deal with him on the reimbursement of the majority of the damages, 50 million forint, and Zusi will take the fool.
Whoever, in any case, could even be offended today, because his requests to relieve the circumstances of his detention, i.e. to his house arrest, were constantly found blind to his ears.
While the criminals of economic crimes that cause much greater harm and which do not reward it can walk freely, or at least in their own home, wait for the end of the proceedings against them, they do not have the opportunity to do so.
Psychology of Excession: Why Do We Spend More Money?
At auctions, customers tend to spend more money, overestimate the goods.
The neurological-economic foundations of this known - and apparently irrational - behavior were discovered by Neurologists and economists at the University of New York.
According to a study published in the journal Science, people don’t want to undermine a type of competition like eBay auction, so they prefer to pay too high prices.
The research attempted to map the nervous scheme of this "playing" with the help of experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers lottoed, the other group participated in a player auction while using the method of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) examined the active brain areas of the experimental people.
In both games the participants were able to win money, but during the auction game - in which an essential element is the other party's overlifting - the striatum, under-brain complex began to work intensely when the game was lost.
This area of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the rise of the price can be explained by avoiding the intense reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the research group’s economists also conducted a financial monitoring investigation.
In this, three groups tendered against a partner under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed about the real value of the product and they made their bets.
Another group also promised that if they win out of the game, they will get another $15 in reward.
The third group, however, received just $15 before the auction, but the group members lost this money in the event of a losing auction.
Therefore, the difference between the two groups was only that they emphasized the victory for one and the loss for the other.
However, demonstrating the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the team playing against losses were willing to get higher rates than the control and the "winning" group.
"These findings cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
For so far, they have only explained the phenomena experienced at the auction with the joy of victory and the avoidance of risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped solve the contradiction between these two theories by now getting a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, professor at the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to go to a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary, chronic liver disease is one of the leading causes of death.
There are hundreds of thousands of people infected with hepatitis here, but only seven thousand are treated, which is the reason: patients often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is the collection name of infectious liver products caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms there are many similarities, characteristic of hepatitis and yellowness, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the pathogen, are spread in two main forms: hepatitis A and E through the nutritional channel (e.g. infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body vessels (cranberry, vaginal vessels, saliva).
Travellers must be vaccinated against the A and B viruses, and there is no vaccine against the C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected food, generally accompanied by illness, weakness, abdominal complaint, nausea.
After these, it develops yellowness visible on the skin and the white of the eye, the outlet is bright, the urine becomes dark, healing can take two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people worldwide die in the most severe form of the disease, hepatitis B caused by liver cancer and liver sulfur.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only every ten infected people get medication treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can also lead to liver swelling, liver cancer.
Most infected people don’t even know about their disease, because the pathogen underlyingly destroys the liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear only after 20-30 years.
So then it is very important for early prevention, to perform regular screening tests.
In three groups, this disease is much more than the average: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug consumers and tattooed people.
The number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C in the world is now 200 million.
Since the disease can already be detected by a routine laboratory examination, when any symptoms of unknown origin are detected, it is advisable to consult a home doctor.
In time recognizing the disease can be healed, the virus can be removed from the body, thus eliminating the infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, which was celebrated for the first time in 2004 by organizations that represent patients around the world.
Its objective is to draw attention to the chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Whoever believes in God is less sick.
A recent study found that religious faith works as a kind of pain relief that could have already facilitated the death of Catholic Martyrs.
Scientists from the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment to explore how the faith affects people's pain perception, the British Telegraph.
As part of the rather bizarre study, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were given electrosocks, while they all studied a painting of the Virgin Mary.
The findings show that Catholic believers were able to eliminate much of the pain.
Thanks to the technique of detection of the human brain, it was also revealed that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for controlling the pain.
The study is the first in a series of research in which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologists from different parts of the university are also involved.
The investigation took place exactly in the way that a scratching device was configured to the left hand of the experimental subject, which supplied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants to look strongly at two paintings, the painting of the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the painting of Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century with the Lady Hermelin.
The researchers hoped that the vision of the Virgin Mary would create a kind of religious state among the believers, while the da Vinci image was chosen because it was not too different from the other and was thought to be calming.
The subjects spent half an hour in a MRI scanner machine, during which time they received 20 electrosocks in four consecutive parts while watching either the religious topic or the general image.
The Catholics that while seeing the Virgin Mary, they felt “safe” as if they were “careful” and “discomforted, peace filled them.”
When they looked at the image on a religious topic, they 12 percent less pain than when they saw Leonardo's work before them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself participated in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful image, even atheists, only the right photo needs to be found.
“We should find a picture that you feel very positive about, like a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“The practice of faith should and in many cases can change our personality,” Wright added.
After the great results, the question is, if Leonardo or a similar caliber painter showed a madonna picture to the believers, what would it have an impact on their pain control?
Would the quality vision of the Virgin Mary bring even better results?
You are what you share about yourself.
On its 10th birthday, Google can tell you: people’s pockets are at least as much as their heads are on the sky; they know where they’ve been on vacation, what special orders they go and what they’re interested in.
And that’s not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s leaders.
As for the skeptics of Orwell’s horrors, they don’t see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s primary goal is to gather more personal data about its users, and that it is necessary for them to be able to keep themselves up to the original goal of Google’s founders, which sounded: “We get all the information of the world into the system!”
According to Google’s CEO, the company, even after 10 years of worldwide work, is just at the beginning of the processing of all the information.
At the question of what will happen in five years, Schmidt replied: “You want Google to be able to answer questions like “What do I do tomorrow?” or “What work is really right for me?” – but until then the software can’t answer such simple questions because they don’t know enough about users.
Not all internet users are aware that the search words are recorded accurately during the internet search, what IP address they were searching for and what page they were left after the search.
Through the Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can, for example, save their own browsing background history, see what they searched, what they clicked on, and in the long run generate much more personalized results - the same logic will be based on the Recommendations, with which the system offers products and services to us based on our previously stated and recorded preferences.
What if they use my data against me when they look at what I am dealing with? - ask users who are concerned with seeing the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, the degree of potential power represented by the company can be frightening, not the awareness of guilt, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, and even the rebellion against power trigger counterreactions in the internet users.
The confirmed fact, however, is that all searched terms are not only recorded, but may, where appropriate, be transmitted to a third party, in such legal cases, the personal rights of Internet users are not protected by anything.
The most sound example of this in recent times was a coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information about pedophiles from the social site Orkut, which itins.
Internet users concerned about personal rights, however, could have been overwhelmed in May, when the company successfully demonstrated its truth in court against the FBI with the EFF electronic law enforcement organization: according to this, Google cannot later be forced by any point of the Constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(In the meantime, the federal government has successfully defeated about fifty thousand web addresses and a thousand search terms, which it has obtained with reference to the strengthening of the child protection law adopted years earlier, but it has not yet managed to obtain the search lists of individual users or a full list of web sites and keywords for two months.)
Google’s judgment is quite contradictory: those who are afraid of giving their personal data are blurred because they feel their intimate sphere and privacy is overwhelmed by starting to use Google’s services and taking up a rebellion against the multinationals in the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic computer fans, activists, and users-compressing hunting in many countries see the next generation of big companies, the “sustainable corporation” in them, unlike its rival, Microsoft, who is a world-conqueror for Windows, no matter how much they both struggle for the same purpose.
This may be because, unlike Microsoft, Google does not ask its users for ID code, does not ask for money for its applications, the open, free, constantly updated source code and software package makes it much more accessible, younger, cool than its official software practice.
However, it can also be because the geeks are accurately aware of the very problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which is one of the most commonly spoken keywords of the past few years, the web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is a matter of collaboration, of deliberately leaving traces and taking advantage of the communication channels available to us, and while the scale varies by individual, the essence is the same: showing ourselves.
A average young man can lead profiles from Facebook to Xang, link them to other services such as Twitter, or last.fm that lists his music habits, and then add them all to tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and also lead a blog that automatically shows their latest photo galleries that are stored on Flickr or Picasan.
While we can read about a number of examples from which it glows out: a girlfriend easily realizes the morning photo stream of a joint friend circle that her fraudulent friend has spent the evening with or can leave a company employee just because she describes her honest opinion on the top leadership in her blog: a certain, the concept of privacy has been completely re-evaluated for now.
Those who live online life consists of what they show out of themselves, we can formulate the foundation behind the behavior of today’s young people.
And whoever wants to hide something, or at least to avoid the Google monopoly, can do it (e.g. with Scroogle, which uses the Google search engine but does not deliberately leave trace).
Not a small number, for example, of people who do not deliberately register on social sites in order to prevent them from appearing, Google’s online apps from the text editor to the image manager and the news reader can be replaced with alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks and that do not make us the best profile ever existed.
The public isn’t even so secretly waiting for Google to show out your tooth protein.
With the current value of $156 billion, the company is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising interfaces are threatening advertising agencies’ revenue, and the increasingly rapidly introduced services are causing serious headaches not only to Microsoft, but also to many other software developers.
The critical observers, however, find an alarming opposite point: the top leadership, for example, completely rejected the employees’ protest, after doubling the company’s kindergarten remuneration, the company’s leadership found it too expensive to pay employees’ daily pleasantly multiple meals, but all of it is disappointed by the fact that Google even in 2006 took the head in front of the Chinese government and, according to their agreement, the company filed all findings that violate the good taste and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One internal rule of the company sounds like not to announce a new service in advance, only when it is already available, but it is certain that the visible problems of the coming months and years can move the world to a new point: while some believe that Google’s book and magazine scan and archiving project has taken such sizes that the company will soon have to face the U.S. Supreme Court, others are afraid of the Health system, in which we can build a full health profile of ourselves with our previous spirits, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database can give a good foundation to the next generation of sci-fi writers, the popular novel of Cory Doctorow, Scroogled point orwelli, describes the future in which a person can only be alarmingly well approached by Google’s data.
Two young people assisted the double murderer in Osaka
Two young people were heard by the police in the case of the double murder in Osda, and they were founded to have helped remove the traces of the crime, the spokesman of the Borsod county police headquarters said on Tuesday.
The young people have acknowledged the offence and are currently accused of crime.
The two teenagers, according to the MTI information, two girls, are defended on a free foot.
Crime may also be punishable with imprisonment of up to 5 years.
The suspect of the double assassination in Osda, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
They are suspected of crimes of massacre committed in advance, for profit.
The investigation found that the 23-year-old man had a greater debt to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt, so his lender was scammed on Wednesday to an Osda settlement, where he died with him and the man's nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the young man was prepared to commit the crime in advance, and it is also a sign that he committed the murder with a gun shut down on the site.
The arms and the circumstances of its use are investigated by the police with the involvement of an expert.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Offers to Purchase Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros – about five billion Czech crowns – were offered to the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange’s 100 percent stock package.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was previously excluded by the Czechs from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
This is due to the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60 percent of the papers within a few months.
The E15 Czech Economic Journal is new to know that the Polish offer is the highest amount ever offered by interested parties for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have presented an offer.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner, and did not exclude that this could lead to the extinction of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated to be 5-10 billion crowns by market experts.
Under the agreement of the shareholders, about 90 percent of the securities could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a share of approximately 25 percent, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
Financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
The European newspapers in their commentary on the deepening of the international financial crisis on Tuesday mention "the second 11th of September."
The global financial catastrophe is thanks to the U.S. president – accuses the Romanian La Repubblica – the president was not even able to list his own party behind the collapse bill aimed at removing the desperate situation...
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, mentioned by the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is better to talk about the second 11th of September.
Some of the Madrid press are also seeing the crime in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership has brought the world economy to the edge of collapse.
The risk of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is increasing and the whole world will suffer.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, the congressional vote threatens that Washington will not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, says Geneva’s Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states can still provide rescue to the planet’s financial institutions, and they can save them from bankruptcy with the money of taxpayers.
But if even more banks fall together, like the dominicocks, then neither funds nor further incentives will be sufficient.
In the long run, it is necessary for the EU Member States to overcome their national egoism and to concentrate control over the divided monetary markets.
Only on Monday, weakening financial institutions received more than €100 billion, the Vienna’s Der Standard reminds that the concerns that, like the Americans, European taxpayers need to go deep into their pockets to resolve the crisis are becoming more realistic.
Until now, the EU has not been seriously dealt with the crisis, which is a tsunami on the old continent.
The “saveers” do not have to flag a hundred billion euros soon, but it would be good to note: in which case it is reasonable to use the money of taxpayers to prevent greater damage.
The Dongo flight is imitated by an intelligent car
What would be the best way to develop technology to avoid collisions if not to imitate obstacle sensors in the world of nature?
For example the bees.
In the surprising project presented at the CEATEC in Japan, the Dong Bees gave the strategic start-up idea to Nissan engineers how to build the next generation of collision-evacuating systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C, a robotic mini-car that has been equipped with the properties of the bees, with the ultimate goal of helping to develop a system that eliminates any collisions.
During flight, each uterus forms its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety protector," said Kazuhhiro Doi, brand manager for technology PR and research and development.
It is important for the complex eye of the uterus, which can be seen in more than 300 degrees in every direction.
To copy the complex eye function, engineers went to the idea of a laser distance meter.
It identifies the obstacles within a distance of 2 meters in a 180-degree view space before BR23C, calculates their distance, and sends a signal to the microprocessor on board, which is immediately translated into an operation to avoid collision.
During the breakdown of the second, the obstacle is detected, and then the car robot follows the movements of the uterus, immediately changing direction by turning its wheels to the extent necessary to avoid collision.
Unlike any current system, this avoidance maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive way.
"If this wasn't the case, the car-robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the head of the Mobility Laboratory and the car-robot project.
You need to respond instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner layer of the safety bulbs, a layer within which the collision is currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process must reflect what a womb does to avoid other wombs.
This process must take place under a glance.
But, unlike the bees, the deviation should not be upward, downward or transparent, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the rotability of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibility available to the bees to escape the other livestock, only the rotating movement and acceleration, as well as the slowing, were used here as the possibility available to the car robot.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy density, which means their life is longer than the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, instinctive intelligent reaction is important, not the ability to process data, even less to store.
This structure needs to process and respond to only a few input signals per second.
There is no need to keep them and respond with intuitive logic based on the data of previous maneuveres, so it consistently uses only a few dozen kilograms of memory.
There is no need for gigabyte or megabyte memories.
This is the first step towards the development of immediate avoidance technology, which, according to Nissan’s estimates, will be involved in series cars within ten years.
Additional application option may be the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to drive the car to the specified end destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
The name of the poisoning child.
A written version of the $700 billion financial rescue package law for the purchase of bank loans has been prepared.
In the first round, half of the amount is spent.
According to Eastern Coastal Time, during the further talks that took place until midnight on Saturday, the congressional leaders came to an end in the debate over a $700 billion rescue package that has been ongoing for days, Reuters.
“We’ve made serious progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives, who said the deal remains on paper.
The agreement was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said on the result of the compromise that the program will work and be effective, but more things are needed.Pelosi said it is not about saving Wall Street but about turning the wheel of the economy.
The written version of the package was announced by the Asian markets before Sunday evening opening (i.e. Monday morning at 2 p.m.) according to Washington time, but did not cause a spectacular outbreak on the stock market.
The draft legislation on the programme, which is called the 2008 Economic Emergency Stabilization Act, will be voted first on Monday by the House of Representatives and will be held in the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelos on Saturday afternoon and the White House welcomed the news of the agreement.
“We are pleased with the progress that we have made this night and we appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
The program differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal, which would have said that $700 billion would have been spent one in one to buy low-quality, credit-based securities.
Now in the first round, up to half of the $700 billion can be spent using $250 billion immediately after Congress is expected to vote on Monday, from which the Ministry of Finance will buy debt-based securities with poor rating, and another $100 billion's fate will depend on the president's decision.
The program will be supervised by a separate body, with the President of the Federal Reserve participating.
The expenditure of the remaining half of 700 billion depends on a new decision by Congress.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can use a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, hypoteks and hypoteks, and other types of "toxic" loans.
The purchase may take place within the framework of auctions and directly, the ministry’s officials said.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program where the financial portfolio guarantees the assets that cause concerns, for which the companies will pay a fee corresponding to the expected damages.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary funds in order to reach up to $700 billion to the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, whether it is the widespread purchase of bad assets, whether it is the insurance or the system risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they are signed, he added.
However, the heads of the banks in trouble and waiting for state aid can expect the government to restrict their withdrawal money — which the overseas slang simply calls a golden slang — by the government.
Restrictions on payments are only made in certain cases, in addition, the limitations depend on the way the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
The limitation in essence means that if the ministry purchases under an auction, an extra tax will be imposed on the gold curtain unless it is sent to retirement for the bank manager.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will act aggressively to ensure that government money is not exaggerated.
The image adds that the existing gold crossing contracts do not change, the limitation applies only to the new ones to encourage participation in the program.
This is the first case in U.S. history that a legal restriction on the remuneration of the chief executive will be in force, said Barney Frank, the chairman of the House’s Financial Services Committee.
In addition, in the banks participating in the program, the state gets the right to acquire shares, thus the risk of taxpayers is reduced, as they can eventually win in the transaction as the economy and with it the rescued bank regains.
The draft law provides that in the next five years the President must submit a proposal to the Congress, which provides how to refund taxpayers the expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course, there were people on both sides who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what the US citizens have asked us, that is, it does not protect the dollars of taxpayers, said Darrell Issa, a Republican representative in California.
Ohio’s Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, said the measures were called by the same people responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

The industry’s domestic sales prices increased by just a minimum of 0.1 percent compared to the previous month.
The domestic sales prices in the processing sectors also rose slightly, 0.1 per cent compared to July.
The highest price increase in August 2008 was due to the skin products and shoe manufacturing sector (2,8 per cent), mainly by the 4.6 per cent price increase in the bag and shoe manufacturing sector and by the 2.5 per cent monthly price increase in the shoe manufacturing sector.
The higher price levels of plastic and chemical materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the price of the chemical and product production sector (1.6 percent).
Price decrease occurred in oil processing (1,4 percent), electrical machinery, instrument production (0,9 percent), and - at a minimum - wood processing (0,1 percent) sectors.
The prices of paper manufacturing, publishing, and printing activities have not changed.
In other processing sectors, prices have increased between 0.2 percent and 0.9 percent.
In the sectors of electricity, gas, steam and water supply, which have a significant weight in domestic sales in the industry, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the lasting impact of the official gas increase since 1 July.
In the twelve-month comparison – with regard to domestic sales of the processing sectors – the oil processing sector increased the most (32.4 percent).
The production of metal processing products in the sector was observed by 13.2 percent, with a price increase of 11 percent in the field of food, beverage, and tobacco production representing the determining weight.
The price decline occurred in the textile, textile manufacturing (2,5 percent) and the manufacturing of electrical machinery and instruments (0.3 percent).

Do you need a visa to the United States next year?
Göncz Kinga sees a good chance that the U.S.-Hungarian visa-free agreement will enter into force around January 12 - the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about it in Chicago, before the local Hungarian leaders.
He said, “Today, everything depends on whether the electronic entrance or control system will be built over the sea in time.”
He also noted that there will be no entrance permit in the new system, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy will hold talks in Washington today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will be awarded to the Central Cross of the Hungarian Republic's Order of Interest with the Star, and will hold talks with the Democratic Party of Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain's foreign policy advisors.
The bank rescue package is supported by Barack Obama and McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two major U.S. presidential candidates, both granted their support on Sunday the government’s $700 billion bank rescue aid package, but there is a politician who demands the finance minister to resign.
After days of marathon talks, Congress and administration representatives announced Sunday morning: they signed a principle agreement on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package to eradicate the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain also demonstrate that they are more suitable than their competitors to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, with the advancement of economic issues, Obama has again gained some advantage, the dissolved advantage of McCain, which he has gained after the Republican Convention, with the nomination of Vice-President Sarah Palin.
In a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the 700-billion-dollar package law will be promptly passed by Congress.
He emphasized that the proposal contains the consumer protection passes that he also supported.
"We have to act now, with responsibility ... your jobs, savings, the entire industries, the stability of the entire economy are a threat," he said to the 35,000 people.
He did not fail to call McCain’s economic ideas outdated.
McCain said in an interview with ABC, “We’ll all have difficulty swallowing it (...) but nothing is simply a path that cannot be passed.”
The Republican Senator said that the proposal included the establishment of a supervisory committee for the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the final satisfaction of the top leaders, he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no significant role in the talks, but he had daily contacts with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives is hoping to vote on the bill on Monday.
The German Language Area
The right-wing camp is untouched, only within the camp the voters have become more self-conscious – so Der Spiegel analyzes CSU’s weak role in Bavaria.
Heidians are ready to govern Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
The Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the internet edition of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter, the Bavarian Revolution, in an article enters his parents, analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, CSU’s erosion began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo had taken over its office.
Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades – and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change of era is also the problem of all Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merkel.
The failure was not quite surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that was almost exactly ten years likely ended: the uncontroversial hegemony of a nation was over.
For ten years, in 1998, CSU fell to 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s below the level of 50 percent.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so even in the so-called Stoiber era.
This is due to a consistent modernization carried out by the CSU in the province, which will disguise its parents.
Socialists have predicted this for 40 years, but they have made a great mistake in the pace. However, it could not have been without consequences to the loyalty of the CSU voters by secularization, educational results, the settlement of the Eastern and Northern Germans in the developing regions of Bavaria.
Modernization is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and the political consequences of this are visible.
The right-wing camp was untouched, only within the camp the voters became more self-conscious, more critical, more self-sufficient.
It is also remarkable that in recent weeks, it is the classical civil groups that have been most distant from the CSU; they are freelancers, industrials, graduates and graduates.
The CSU support has fallen below 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna newspaper, “Who, with whom? the party leaders in the coalition issues,” discusses the confusing internal policy situation that has emerged after the Austrian elections.
The SPE will negotiate with the SVP.
It prohibits interference in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens do not want to negotiate the coalition yet.
The election took place, now everything is rotating around the coalition; in the debate held on public service television, the party leaders hardly allowed an insight into their cards.
SPÖ Chairman Werner Faymann confirmed he intends to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that there is a possibility of cooperation between the two parties – in certain provinces and in social partnership.
The question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer – the current president of the ÖVP as a deputy chancellor – was left open by Faymann.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course has been denied anyway.
Repeating this direction is not to be said.
Molterer responded cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, the cooperation will not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the OVP.
Whether the party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition is for now completely open in the party, the issues must necessarily be discussed within the ÖVP.
President Jörg Haider has repeatedly shown himself open to all directions.
“To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take government responsibility,” Haider said.
The devil circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Peak on Equal Opportunities is hosted by France, which is the chairman of the European Union this year.
Járóka Lívia, the representative of the European People's Party Fidesz, in her message to the Plenum as one of the main spokesmen of the professional consultation, attended the educational segregation because it is one of the most serious violations of the Rom children and, in addition, the most serious obstacle to their existence.
The high-level conference - on behalf of the French presidency - was opened by Xavier Bertrand, the French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meetings included representatives of governments, European social partners and the leading European rights defenders and civil organizations in the field of equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the news agency of the Fidesz EP Group, warned that, in addition to discrimination in employment, the Romans are largely out of the labour market due to their low education.
“The vast majority of Roma youths do not have a secondary education, and due to low-quality primary education, only an immense part of them can obtain higher education.”
Járóka also emphasized that as a fundamental human right, education plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children may mean strengthening the economy of the EU Member States.
According to the representative, it is necessary to be aware of these connections in the broadest range – even between the Roms and not the Roms.
Indeed, the earlier a Roma student begins to school, the greater the chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; they contribute to the national budget through income and consumption taxes.
“The right of Romans to be EU citizens must ensure their right to quality education and ensure the elimination of their low-quality and isolated education,” said Járóka Lívia.
According to the representative, it is necessary for the European Union to have a target and action-oriented co-operation to rapidly accelerate the processes of disregation in schools, which is essential for the proper observance of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
“The devil circle of poverty, segregation, unemployment must be broken, the children of the Romans must be given the opportunities of the democratic space to contribute as a full-right citizen to the future of Europe,” Járóka said.
The European Equality Summit, which has been held annually since the last year’s Berlin Summit, is intended to provide a unique forum to promote the objectives of equality and non-discrimination at European and Member States level.
CSU: Grace to the Transitional Time
Decides the fate of the Huber-Beckstein duo
Despite the massive election failure, the heads have not yet fallen down, and the Bavarian CSU summaries have so far postponed the discussion of personal issues.
The party leader Erwin Huber and provincial Prime Minister Günther Beckstein may still remain in his place, questioning how long the grace will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a disastrous 17 percent vote loss, will be decided by an extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
The members of the very criticized couple, in any case, realized that they don’t stick with all their strength to their chair.
Through this, they tried to relieve the angry members of the faction and the base who, one day after the "Bajor tsunami", demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, with the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the top of his track, the Christian social union gained 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the Stoiber coup, it has only run to 43.4 percent.
For 46 years, CSU has been “unilateral” in Bavaria, which accounts for 18 percent of German GDP.
While the conservatives continue to expect high in the southern province, which is key to Hungarian economy, they will definitely be forced to coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of the reform within the party, Vice-President Horst Seehofer and Federal Minister of Agriculture, who is the potential successor of Huber, will also take a place in the narrow detection team that will start thrilling negotiations with the liberal FDP and the Free Electors, organized along the right-wing values, on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange fate of the fate is that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was exploited by Huber-Beckstein as a pair of coupable opportunity, entered the list of the Free Electors, and then was treated with the high-quality municipal politician.
CSU leaders are now spending all their energy to somehow stabilize Beckham.
In the transition, the active role will also be given to Stoiber, who has spoken on the background, who has called September 28 the worst day in the political career of the former provincial prime minister and former CSU president.
On Monday, Huber raised some sharp comments to the CDU, saying it would deserve much more support from the Brother Party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel as well.
After the 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be chancellor if the CSU, which plays a significant role in the 2005 national success, is not in any way claimed to be recovered.
Merkel said the loss of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the Berlin coalition.
What is, of course, relatively: the wounded CSU will not be easier to deal with, and the social-democratic crisis will continue.
The SPD has achieved its weakest result since 1946 with 18.6 percent.
Lukasenko with 110-0
None of the opposition representatives entered the parliament of Belarus after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the well-being and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the European Security and Cooperation Organization (European Security and Cooperation Organization) it can be explained by the irregularities committed during the voting.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 100 million people in the 10 million countries has been without opposition for a long decade, the opposition united by the United Democratic Forces (ODS) had seriously hoped that, as a result of the constitutional amendment, Lukasenko, who renewed his presidential office for a quarter in the controversial purity elections of 2006, this time will "allow" some opposition representatives to appear in parliament.
The ODS has also stopped the previously considered boycott.
The backdrop of the opposition expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia – which has borrowed to reduce the continuously expensive Russian gas imports and has contributed to the provision of the transit gas pipelines to the Russian Federation – wanted to improve its relations with the EU, where Lukasenko and several high-ranking politicians are not allowed to enter due to the anti-Democratic political system of Belarus.
In advance, he referred to a relief that the EBESC, when evaluating the election campaign, focused on positive movements rather than the shortcomings, such as prohibiting a third of opposition candidates from leaving.
However, the EBESC’s Monday Rapid Report has already opposed the campaign – in which opposition candidates were essentially unable to appear in the press – and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the counting of the votes.
At the same time, the opposition says there is a noticeable improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to make a minor confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which is separated from Georgia, although Russia – with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper – has seen the two territories independent for a month.
“We’ve made two steps ahead, one behind, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun,” Alexander Milinkevich told the press.
The opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election said it is desirable that this remain, despite the fact that "the power was afraid to allow even one opposition to enter the unhealthy parliament."
The opposition does not plan protests in view of the results, it is rather trying to send the message of the need for economic reforms to the voters.
“We have a lot of trouble with this, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, the local authorities are putting obstacles to dissemination, but I see that more and more people are supporting the change, even among the elderly,” Milinkevich said, pointing to the fact that the Lukasenko regime, which considers the social security creation as its main result, does not even the layer of the most officially supported retirees consider it appropriate.
"The country's debt, the growth of trade deficit, is a matter of time, the breakdown of social security, which is "calling the silence of the cemetery," Milinkevich said.
Against the opposition politician, Russian observers qualified the elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebegyev, the head of the Mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosty: "People believe not in words but in acts," so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: “Smake breakfast only before working hours”
In the history of the Chigi Palace, unique rotating doors were installed for the exit and entrance of workers.
From today, this new measure will enter into force against dealers, to disfilter those who block and then go to drink a coffee at work time.
The anti-journal news was presented today by the Minister of Administration Renato Brunetta and the Secretary-General of the Prime Minister's Office Mauro Masi.
"Their rotators - said Brunetta - serve to better and more efficient work, reduce the shortcomings and increase the services."
“There is a new, more responsible and more transparent period.
This is the real reform,” Brunetta emphasized.
The Chigi Palace will complete the installation of all the ministerial council buildings.
According to Masi, "the installation of their rotating stones is also symbolically important."
We did not experience any resistance from the staff - the Secretary-General confirmed: "The staff corrected the measure, everyone worked together."
In a word, the breakfast is over in working hours, there is no more coffee and brios.
Brunetta smiling advises: "A good little capuccino in the morning at seven is capable of miracles."
School of Public Administration in Rome
The Minister said: “In three months, the lack of health in the public sector has decreased by 50 percent, which means more than 60,000 people in a year.”
He added that the Italian government should be more efficient.
"Which's wage dynamics - according to the minister - has been twice as high as its private sector in the last 8-10 years, and has far exceeded the inflation rate."
At the same time, thousands of public officials gathered together to join the proposal supported by the Italian Environment and Consumer Conservation Association to protest the requirements of the Brunetta Regulation.
"While the administrative minister is proud of data that supports the reduction of deficiencies due to the disease, the 'untouchable diaries' scope is continuously growing," the consumer protection association writes.
Thousands of honest and hard-working government officials across Italy have gathered together to sign war against the illegal regulations.”
The regional administrative court is attacked, among other things, by the abolition of the supplementary remuneration for the disease that can be recovered for service reasons, by the extension of the time of residence of the workers in vacation, which means the period within which the patient visitor may appear, and by several other criteria provided for in the new provisions prescribed by the Minister.
Job Accidents: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything else
Every day there are 2,500 work accidents in Italy, three of which result in deaths and 27 in permanent unemployment.
According to the employment accident insurance agency, 1,200 deaths occurred at work in 2007.
The numbers testify on the severity of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death, and requires twice as many casualties as murder.
Today, Anmil celebrates the 58th Day of Victims of Occupational Accidents in all counties in Italy, traditionally on the second Sunday of October, to attract the attention of institutions, social organizations and mass communications to this dramatic problem.
“Anmil’s alarming data, as well as the tragic events of recent days, also underline that prevention has an outstanding role in the workplace accidents,” Giorgio Napolitano told Republican President Pietro Mercandelli, in his message to the President of the National Association of Occupational Accidents Rokkants.
The head of state honoured "the unity's enduring commitment to the prevention at work, the protection of the interests of workers suffering from accidents, the assistance of victims' family members and the sensitivity of the public."
“These kinds of tragedies are natural and honestly shared by everyone, which, by their scale, raise the interest of the media and the public, but in reality, we must face dramatic, repeated and repeated cases every day.”
Napolitano openly acknowledges: "We are undoubtedly facing a lack of resources, funding for education and information is crucial.
Initiatives within the school aimed at direct awareness for young people on the threshold of entry into the world of work.
It is our duty to maintain interest in the phenomenon, not to allow the attention to be lost on the social importance of the issue, and we need more effective legislation that should be enforced.
The chairman of the House of Representatives, Gianfranco Fini, emphasized “the severity of death-resulting work accidents, the social importance of all of us, and the institutions are required to end it as soon as possible.”
“Data on work accidents shows a slight improvement, but the number of deaths of this kind is still incredibly high,” said Pietro Mercandelli, chairman of Anmil.
“We don’t want this decreasing trend to be combined with decreasing attention, because the greatest tragedies occur when the attention is lost.”
"We believe that at a general level we are still not doing everything to overcome the phenomenon that could be solved through a complex action program.
We believe that stricter supervision and control would be needed, Mercandelli emphasized, and more significant intervention in the field of labour training, starting from school education.”
“There are further efforts needed to inform and make the public sensitive,” he added.
But what would be most needed is a more responsible employer environment against a phenomenon that is a social problem.”
Mercandelli then criticized “the gradual deterioration of the compensation protection network for the victims of work accidents” as well as the “help direction that the system has been pushing towards in recent years.”
“The goal is, therefore, to return to workers the security provided by the insurance, because the fate of the victims of the accident cannot depend on the lawmakers where it is voluntary and where it is dividing.”
MP3 players can cause hearing damage
Permanent hearing loss can cause longer and high volume listening of portable players, such as MP3 devices.
The European Commission and the Scientific Committee on New and New Identified Health Risk (SCENIHR) have published a report in Brussels.
"The expert opinion shows that 5 to 10 percent of people who listen to their portable music player for more than an hour a day for a period of five years may suffer permanent hearing loss," the statement said.
“It’s astonishing that young people who use high-volume portable music players and mobile phones massively and frequently are unconscious that they can irreversibly damage their hearing,” Meglena Kuneva said.
“Scientific surveys indicate an indisputable risk to which we need to respond urgently,” the EU Commissioner added.
The main task is to inform consumers and broadly disseminate information about it.
In the light of this expert opinion, we should also review the existing control systems so that they can operate efficiently and continue with the latest technologies.”
Brussels has called on the independent scientific committee to investigate the issue due to the spread of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that they cause.
"The researchers confirm that we have reasons to worry and the European Commission is ready, in cooperation with the Member States and stakeholders, to examine what possible measures could be adopted to protect children and adolescents exposed to noise by portable players and similar devices," the committee said.
The current European safety standard determines the maximum noise levels that can be emitted by portable music players at 100 dB, however, increasing concerns are accompanied by data on hearing loss due to excessive use of such sound sources.
However, there are solutions such as reducing the level and duration of noise, which can significantly reduce such hearing disorders.
The EU Scientific Committee explains in its opinion that those using a portable player who listen to music with a high volume (more than 89 decibel) for five hours a week, the noise rate exceeds the current maximum value for workplace noise.
If a person is listening to music for a longer period in similar circumstances, after five years there is a risk of permanent hearing loss.
This portable device affects approximately 5-10 percent of users, which could mean 2.5 to 10 million people in the EU.
Germany, Rome forms a committee responsible for the future of the capital
It starts today, lasts until March, and the results are expected in June.
This schedule was drawn up by the Metropolitan Municipality for the operation of the "Future of the Capital of Rome" committee, which was gathered this morning at the new headquarters behind the baths of Caracalla.
In the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the remaining 49 committees will develop the Rome Directives.
After the final speech in March, the general assembly and the municipality committee will evaluate the study and the plans to be submitted in June to the capital strategic plan officially approved by the municipality and the mayor Gianni Alemanno.
“This is a completely independent committee, in which all kinds of political, social and cultural ideas are represented, and its task is to draw up proposals on the development ideas of Rome on which political decision makers, the General Assembly and the Municipal Committee can rely.
There is no question of any competent conflict of interest, we would only want a platform where great plans can be made for the benefit of Rome.
In March, after completing its work, the committee will be divided because it has a mandate for a fixed time.
In June, we will submit a strategic plan based on the work of the committee entitled "The future of the capital of Rome", the mayor said.
To those who consider the Commission’s functioning unnecessary, referring to the fact that its opinion is not binding, Alemanno replies: “It all depends on what work the Commission will do and what quality proposals it will put on the table.
If the standard is appropriate, as in France, in the case of the Attali Commission, which I assure in Rome, the contribution it will play an important role.
The power of policy is often divided in the management of everyday affairs, as well as in the management of emergency cases that occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we, taking into account the prospects, look further and plan for the longer term and work committed to the development and future of Rome.”
The Mayor of Rome wants to point out that "this Commission cannot be considered a useless "water head" because it is completely free and will not be paid to a single euro for the Romanian citizens, but it serves as a distraction and aims to involve the greatest minds of the capital."
According to Alemanno, “there is a need for an open end and a flexible strategic framework that will enable our city to jump at the level it would so need, thinking in a unified spirit of its future.”
About the future, with regard to which the Mayor of Rome emphasizes: “It will not only be limited to the current municipal framework, but looks far further,” we see in it not only the future metropolitan and capital status, but “the role that Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean region can and must play as the capital.”
Obama is the first anti-American president, we’ll show you why.
A well-known, independent American politician wrote about this: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter who, by his decisions, destroyed the U.S. economy and established close ties (as he does as a private person today) with the enemy Islam.
As the date of the election is approaching, the attacks against Obama are increasing.
A Miami lady wrote this on the internet: "This man is full of ambitions.
"Obama is unfathomly believed to be able to gain the highest public dignity of a nation whose two governors and five senators have been black."
These attacks are actually nothing to say; of course, they are racist, but they don’t give an answer to the voters’ question whether he will be a good president.
In this case, there is also someone who is listening to his emotions and not his mind.
Inside the South States, a Mississippi newspaper wrote in its lead article: We know well that in the voting cabin the true American patriot will give up his vote.
A side of American thinking appears here that has remained hidden until the last moment.
“Take what you want, then we know where we will put the jewel, Obama or McCain.”
Some people swear that if Obama wins, they will leave the United States.
There has never been such words until now, when the black candidate’s success is almost assured.
At the same time, despite all these smarts, the winning weapon of the Democrats is George Bush himself.
1,500 people were asked about what were the mistakes made during Bush's office? 89 percent responded to Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and was throwed into a fool to fly home.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers were killed, and the Americans did not have to pack them.
The majority believes that Iraq was the weak spot of Bush.
It’s a big job for George W. to be replaced.
The U.S.: The economic collapse is already felt by journalists, the time of restrictions has come in the editorials. Many people blame the Internet because of the "death" of the printed press.
The PEW Research Institute has asked five hundred American journalists what they think about the future situation and intellectual power of their profession.
Nowadays, almost every journalist is pessimistic about his own future.
However, it was not clear that their concerns about authenticity would be reduced.
They don’t feel as isolated as before.
The problem of American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis is a failing economic model.
Another serious concern is the newsroom, i.e. the restrictions on the editors that make the newspaper.
If we do not want that traditional journalism, in the sense of what the large public understood under this, to be minimized, this problem must be solved, the questioned journalists say.
Today, clearly visible and complex pessimism is characterized by American journalism.
60 percent of journalists and senior leaders working in printing press are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong path.
At local level, 65 percent of journalists are in top leadership positions.
Printed and Electronic Press.
The press staff does not make it difficult to see where the world network is going.
The biggest publishers break their way to the Internet, which many believe is the "mortal" of the printed press.
The “economic pressure” perceived by journalists increased to 79 percent.
The 500 interviewed journalists admitted that they would vote for technology in the hope that it might be for the benefit of journalism.
Today, in the American press industry, there is a gap between the editorial leaders, i.e. the directors, and the journalists who work for them.
On a national level, 56 percent of leaders are confident that their reporters will share their information with others, while on a local level, this rate is only 23 percent.
Some are linked to this workplace.
At national level, 47 percent of managers are concerned that they may lose their jobs within three years.
For journalists, this is 30 percent.
In America, the question of "safe work" at team level (for our editors, editors) is constantly on the agenda.
Only 13 percent of journalists have contracts.
In the case of a huge nation like the 300 million inhabitants of the United States, where thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television and internet providers operate, employers generally recommend as much as they want, so the thing works on the basis of "need or not".
Directors generally get high wages, and editors can earn $10,000 a month, in addition to paying retirement and health insurance fees.
Freedom, on the other hand, works on a rather complex principle: in the first year x days, in the third also, until after a certain time it reaches the maximum of 15 days.
But U.S. journalists, according to their own confession, are often "sick" during the year.
It all depends on the climate.
UNIPOL: ROMAN COUNCIL: DANILO COPPOLA GROTTAFERRATABAN MARAD
Carmelo Rinaudo, Chairman of the Second Criminal Division of the Roman Court, rejected the application of the real estate business Danilo Coppola, who wanted to pass from his residence, Grottaferrat, to a Roman apartment.
Coppola is undergoing an investigation of the bankruptcy in the framework of an investigation of the agreement on share exchange between Unipol and BNL.
Last week, during the proceedings against him, the house arrest was dismissed and changed to a residence-abandon ban for Grottaferrat.
Their lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked the real estate expert to pass from the rural small town to the capital apartment.
However, according to the court, such disagreements (for which the prosecutor has made a rejecting proposal) would allow the company to influence its affairs and have access to the evidence brought against it.
The Elite is in Danger
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House of Representatives failed to vote on the $700 billion rescue package proposed by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were more interested and still interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is also supported by the New York Times, which reports that the current crisis has led to a breakthrough within the Republican Party, which shows an increasing divide between the traditional, distorted Eastern coast attitude that supports federal institutions and business circles and the increasing new anti-Washington and financial world directions in the central and southern states.
This direction was critically expressed during the House of Representatives voting referred to in the introduction.
However, this event is just one of the major changes that the economic transformation that is still ongoing predicts or allows to be seen, and not only in the United States, but in the whole western world, and outside it.
It seems that the crisis, both in the United States and Europe, will only accelerate the long-standing phenomena that are consolidated in this new atmosphere and eventually revealed.
The first such phenomenon is the re-actualization, the return of the double category of state sovereignty to the public consciousness, about a kind of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis affects the banking and financial institutions that, although they have close ties with abroad, are primarily and quite broadly concerned with people and families living in one country, one state.
This, on the other hand, represents a direct political difficulty for those in the government: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people who are also voters.
Therefore, although the crisis seems global in economic terms, it is almost exclusively national in political terms.
Political internationalism appears to be essentially out of the coastline: it is a clear proof of this that the European Union is unable to designate a single political direction by lavirating between different interests and different national strategies.
Thus, everyone is expecting intervention, a rescue package, a resurrection and new rules from each national government, but above all the opening of monetary funds: because in a difficult situation, only each state has economic resources, a financial asset that could be able to fix things.
They also have the resources and the authority to use them: in certain circumstances, they have two resources of an unprecedented value that no other market and any international organization will likely ever possess in such a degree.
Furthermore, the new emphasis put by the crisis on national state is fully consistent with the fact that the economic growth of recent times attributes an increasing importance to a factor which is closely linked to this element: the territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the abstract world of the network, the increasingly sophisticated technology, and that the global financial world was intended to dominate the world, we just had to realize that our future was increasingly dependent on things that are not at least abstract, such as water, harvest, and oil.
From things that can be transported from one half of the planet to the other, they can be entirely connected to one surrounded place, to one area.
Thus, whoever governs the territory has much more striking cards than whoever, unfortunately, is born in a place where there is no harvest, there is no oil, there is no water.
I would also go through to the second news, which is a sort of breakdown line.
Those who say that the territory, the state, the government, are necessarily saying: politics, in other words, leadership.
From this point of view, the economic crisis seems to produce two contradictory phenomena:
On the one hand, the objective recognition of the need for authentic leadership, for those who can take the events in hand.
On the other hand, the current leadership, in particular the economic leaders, is bringing a complete loss of credit, which has proven to be completely inappropriate and has proven that many are still ahead of them in the empty area.
The two together have even deeper importance and, in a sense, even more disturbing: the feeling of credit loss, intolerance, inappropriation and isolation, which affects the entire leadership elite in more and more Western countries.
Therefore, it seems that the belief of the population is increasingly widespread that the time of the upper social elite has ended. It has ended, even before their actions, their experiences, their way of life, their culture, in the complex sense of the word, had become themselves. Thus the social elite becomes more and more alien to the opinion of the majority.
In a word, the demand for leadership, in a covered form, feeds a wide-ranging but strong delegitimation movement against the ruling class and the traditional political system. This is manifested in the unpredictable "revolutions" of voters, or in recent times in sudden changes in the public atmosphere. such as the rise of the conservatives to power in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the working party unity in Great Britain, or the rebellion of U.S. Congressmen's representatives against Bush (and the victory of the Italian right side can also be listed here).
It seems that the traditional elite, with its parties, its programs, and even it can be said that, in accordance with its habits, its press and its famous intelligence, it is less and less able to represent what is going on in the deeper layers of Western society for some time.
Despite all this, talking about the “mass rebellion on the threshold” would be, honestly, an exaggeration.
But walking with open eyes is not bad at all.
We can walk with a superpowered stick on the wall.
A superpowered stickers help you to overcome gravity and walk on the wall like Spider-Man.
This goal has been established by several U.S. research centers, and a group of four institutions is approaching the solution.
With only 2.5 square centimeters of adhesion, the researchers managed to attach and keep a body of 100 kilograms to a vertical wall.
The US Journal of Science published the discoveries of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the group of scientists was derived from the further development of special, known as carbon nanopark structures already existing.
"The functioning principle of the adhesive must be imagined as a pack of spaghetti-like pipe system," says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The researchers drowned the idea from the feet covered with microscopic cracks of the cacao, which provides the animal with a perfect attraction.
Tests with different materials, such as glass, teflon and cylinder paper, have confirmed that the new adhesive is ten times more efficient than the hips of the mentioned hips, while at the same time "leftly removed from the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material can be useful as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe yes, but researchers prefer to think about a less impressive use than connecting electronic devices because coal nanoparks well drive heat and electricity.
You can also find more applications in space research.
The superheroes can wait.
The Second Research - the University of Berkeley in California is also conducting experiments with a new adhesive.
According to an article published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, California scientists have presented a hair-like, microfiber adhesive that goes through self-cleaning during movement on the surface, making it always a perfect attachment.
Fruit juice is prohibited.
You should be careful with grapefruit, orange and almonds.
These are high-vitamin drinks, especially popular in the summer, if they are entered into the body along with certain life-saving drugs, they change their absorption, strengthening or reducing their effect depending on the case.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, announced at the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia that a glass of grapefruit, orange or almate could reduce the absorption of certain life-saving drugs, preventing their beneficial effects and threatening the patient’s health.
Grapefruit juice was previously placed on the board of the accused when it was revealed that it was able to increase the effect of some antibiotics, antihistamines, anxiety-reducers, heart rhythm-regulating and nerve drugs to a toxic level.
Two years ago, the Italian Pharmaceutical Institute itself published the news in its official publication and also warned doctors and patients to take the risks associated with the aforementioned co-consumption seriously and to pay attention to what they drink when taking medications such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, orange and almonds also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of drugs.
It could be a long list of the active ingredients that are blocked by grapefruit and other fruit juices.
Michele Carruba, a professor at the Department of Pharmacy at the State University of Milan, said: “These discoveries are generally immediately notified to the various national and international pharmaceutical institutions, which, if necessary, will make sure that the data on the information on the product is changed.
Therefore, it is always necessary to read the indicator of the medication intended to be taken, and if something is incomprehensible, let us not be influenced, but clearly ask our therapist or pharmacist,” said an expert at the Ansa Institute.
Paul Krugman received the Nobel Prize in Economics
Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his analysis of trade models and regional contexts of economic activity.
The 55-year-old Krugman teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known publicist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the strongest critics of the Bush government’s economic and foreign policy measures.
A few months after the September 2001 terrorist attack, when the Enron failed, Krugman predicted in his lead article published in the New York Times that the latter incident would have even more fatal consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of the Twin Towers.
This forecast raised not a few discussions, it was repeatedly placed in the eyes of the economist, but today we already know it was accurate.
“I’m surprised and a little shocked about how quickly the public interest has gone beyond the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is “a remarkably valuable economist” but is quite “aggressive to spread his criticism of Bush’s government’s excessive liberalism.”
Open Office, the third edition of the “Microsoft Against” package
Today, OpenOffice.org 3.0 offers an open-source application package that enhances personal productivity, which is a free alternative to Microsoft Office, targeting increasingly widespread layers, from home to office users, from freelancers to public administration.
Following SUN Microsystem’s supervised and voluntary developers’ work for a year, the new Open Office comes to the public with several innovations: in addition to the welcome screen and the re-thinked, less Sparta user interface, it offers several important innovations, such as Apple’s Mac OS X operating system compatibility and supports the new ISO Open Document Format 1.2 format.
It has been focused on compatibility with Office 2007, so Open Office can also open new Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting is the specific feature of some modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful for file sending by e-mail. Another feature supports the import of PDF files into the graphic module by keeping the page layout.
In this interface, we can also create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format with the table manager or text editor elements.
Sharing within applications has also gone through a number of developments: the table manager supports the sharing of workbooks, but prevents each other’s work from being overwritten. Each employee’s comments are marked in different colors, which helps to make it easier to recognize in the check-up phase.
Some companies are already working on making some of the OpenOffice features available from the Internet (on the cloud), so the final version is likely to be presented in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, after appearing on the mirror pages, is available on the English side since Friday, can be downloaded from the following address: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
The package is also available for Linux in addition to the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
On request, we can receive the installation CD either at home or at work.
In terms of the spread of the home application, free is probably the most attractive, but the Open Office package is now trying to throw the ball into the business sector as you can expect a number of administrative and school projects.
There is no lack of ideal education, consultancy and service services for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open new business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, a Word-like text editor; Calc, a table manager to replace Excel; Impress, Powerpoint-like presentations; Dbase is the most well-known, Access-like database manager; and finally Draw the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to 5 million downloads. But if we take into account that with the release of the new version we are already over 3,600,000, this number is likely to be higher than expected.
Kohl's results are positive, this is the fourth doping case.
In the last stage of the Tour de France, a positive pattern was produced by one of the participants, Austrian Bernhard Kohl, who competed in the Gerolsteiner team's colors, who, in addition to my bronze, won the trick for the best mountain climbers.
The news was posted on the Equipe Internet newspaper.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth competitor, after the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepol, as well as German, also Gerolsteiner competitor Stefan Schumacher, who produced a positive result in the EPO’s third-generation Cera test.
Kohl's blood sample, similar to the tests in recent weeks, was examined in labs in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control tests also confirm the positive Cera result, the Austrian will lose his third place and will be banned from competing for two years according to the standards.
The news of the positive outcome of Kohl’s third-generation EPO test was also confirmed by Pierre Bordry, the head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and told the Associated Press news agency that he had indicated the positive doubleing outcome to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian man, behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, won the best mountain climbing trick.
The New York Times asks the question: Is Italy racist?
Italy has just recently changed from the country of immigrants to one of the favourite destinations of hosted immigrants.
This question is raised by the New York Times, starting with the case of the young Burkina Faso Abdul William Guibre - who was murdered last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies - a long article dedicated to the debate about racism in Italy.
The case is well characterized by what the New York Times calls the "paradox of the parties": in the northern regions the "greater integration and the highest employment" while the "anti-immigrant and the Northern League support" is also the strongest in the country.
To support the increasing tensions between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also quotes the incidents in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And even.
The new laws demanded by the League, which would strengthen the control of immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, were also introduced as an example of the climate change in Italy.
This trend is also highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano XVI met with Benedict in the Quirinale Palace and urged the state and the Church to work together to overcome racism."
Students are suffering from expensive rental fees, a room can cost up to €900
The market of accommodation issued to students is not affected by the crisis.
According to a recent survey by Sunia, the Association of Housing Renters, a student can pay up to €900 for a single bedroom in Milan, €700 in Florence, €650 in Naples and €600 in Rome.
“The phenomenon has already reached an incredible scale, which – due to the massive total cost of the families – blocks the wide layers of students from learning,” explains Laura Mariani, head of the Sunia Study Office. “The high demand for students in these cities has distorted the market to a degree that a general cost-making process has also begun against the local inhabitants.”
In most cases, real estate offers also contain a series of irregularities: unregistered contracts with no rental time limitation, associated rental.
According to Sunia, an extraordinary measure would be needed to make it possible to maximize prices through a review of the taxation system.
The details of the survey show that in Milan, in the vicinity of Brianza, a bed is requested for €450; the price of a single room ranges from €650 (Bande Nere) to an average of €800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but it can also reach €900 (Vittoria).
In Florence, a bedroom costs an average of 350/400 euros, and a room is about 700.
In Bologna, where a lot of students live in a neighborhood near the university, a bedroom costs 250/280 euros if it is double bed and 370-500 euros if it is a single bedroom.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are requested for a single and 450 euros for a bed in a double room.
Somewhat cheaper (550 euros for a single room) prices are near the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
In the suburban districts you can save everything: it costs €300 for a bed and €450 for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples for a bed is requested 300/450 euros, for a room from 400 to 600 euros. The price rate is the highest in the vicinity of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
Bar is required to pay 250/350 euros for a bedroom and at least 350 euros for a single bedroom.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute value, but they represent a greater weight within the city buzz.
In cities such as Peru, where students outside the EU are also frequently looking for accommodation, another disorder is also seen: the rental fee requested by foreign students is about 25-30 percent higher than in the case of Italian renters.
Vislát good old Cinema Paradiso, in the cities sacrificed the time of the old cinemas
Traditional movies are closed in favour of the Multiplex.
“A city where there is no cinema, a blind city is like a face without eyes.”
Pictures made by Giuseppe Tornatore effectively show everything that happens in the big cities of Italy, but also in rural regions.
The deforestation of the cinema – the appearance of large, multi-room cinema in the suburbs, and, as a result, the deforestation of the one-room in the city centers – is a process that seems inevitable and irreversible, but at the same time is private with all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
When places full of history and memories disappear, "it's like a friend goes away, a acquaintance with whom we shared our way and a lot of experiences," says Cinema Paradiso's director. The film, which twenty years ago awarded the Oscar and the Grand Prix of the Cannes Festival to Tornado, tells the story of a small town cinema lyria, the desire for a movie experience that may have been lost forever.
The biggest association of operators, the data provided by Anec, is clear: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinema theatres have been closed. The greatest losses have been accounted for in the big cities: 10 cinema theatres have been closed in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Torino and 5 in Palermo.
One of the most affected regions is Emilia-Romagna, which lost 82 single-room films, followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardia (41).
And that for their disappearance the conquest of the multiplex is responsible for what does not prove better than the highest number of newly opened multi-room movies in Italy in these three regions: in the last five years, the number of halls has increased by 195 in Lombardy, 81 in Tuscany and equally in Emilia-Romagna.
"The number of units in Italy has increased in an irrational way," says Anec President Paolo Protti. "It's okay that we build new facilities, but the survival of the already existing should also be guaranteed, because when a city cinema is closed, not all enthusiasts are willing to move into the multiplex.
Not to mention the unemployed funds intended to support operators: the expiration of the state's debt can be made at approximately 10 million euros.
It is both ethically and morally shameful that the government does not comply with the current legislation.
It would require €16 to €18 million a year to maintain the market.”
This is the first Italian city to resolve the problem through an agreement between the municipality and the Anec in order to protect and promote the outer and central one-room cinema.
The provisions would include tax benefits provided to operators and the benefits provided to the public to facilitate accessibility: viewers can get back to limited areas and park in certain parking stations at discount rates.
“I like this initiative,” says Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities, even with the introduction of other measures, will follow the example of Bologna.
But it is also certain that the traditional cinema, in order to be able to take the struggle with the domination of the multiplex, needs to improve the quality of sound and image, because today’s audience is much more demanding.
The preservation of traditional cinema has always been an important question for me: the closure of the Supercinema in Bagheria - where I spent my childhood and youth - has given the scratch for which I finally made the Cinema Paradiso, although I have been thinking about it for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to the Via Nazionalén before the closed Rialto or the Quirinale, so that I can’t see dirty posters from the dust, I’m rather turning my head.
Close lines between politics and 'ndrangheta' arrested Mayor of Gioia Tauro
"Gioia Tauro's mayor supported the interests of the Piromalli clan in municipal decisions."
Serious accusations have been made against the judges of the Anti-Mafia Directorate in Calabria, Mayor and Deputy Mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and Mayor of Rosarno, Carlo Martelli, who have been arrested this morning for allegations of external participation in a criminal coalition.
Billinch was also handed by Gioacchino Piromalli, a senior mediator between the clan and the administration, as well as his uncle, a lawyer with the same name as the head, who had previously been convicted of participating in a mafia-like criminal association and was charged with a compensation of 10 million euros.
"Any legal and moral rule is not accepted, more than a good taste," the prosecutors write. The two local municipalities have expressed their intention to pay a consultancy fee to the Piromalli lawyer.
"So the clan would have officially had an entrance to the city house, which would have given an additional opportunity to control and control the public administration, which can be said to be significant anyway.
Agazio Loiero, the chairman of the General Assembly of the Calabria Region does not hide that in the region "there is a number of reunions between the local institutions and the organized subworld": There are areas where the spread of the mafia is stronger than elsewhere where the reunions are almost inevitable.
Many local politicians, however, resist the 'ndrangheta' pressure, they are the heroes who remain clean."
The arrests this morning are the continuation of the July events, when the police also announced that they managed to end the Piromalli clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were dismissed from their office for the administration of the municipality. the municipality committee of Gioia Tauro was once dissolved in 1991, even then, due to alleged confusion between organized crime and the local municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, a Christian-democratic mayor who ruled during the dissolution, was the leader of the middle-right coalition in the second round in 2006.
It was a scandal when the council ordered the dissolution of the municipal committee.
He appealed to court at the time Deputy Minister of the Interior, Marco Minninit, and accused him of planning everything for political purposes. But the court said in the arrest order signed this morning that the Piromalli clan had dared to demand a change of the A3 project.
The hearing against Dal Torrion reveals, the prosecutors write, that “there was a desire to comply with the demands of an extensive group of entrepreneurs who are known to be close to the Piromalli family, to subordinate the decisions of the municipality to the clan interests.”
The energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones come.
It is an inexhaustible source of energy that accounts for 70 percent of the planet’s surface and is now discovered by major international energy companies.
Waves, sea streams, rivers, and renewable energy sources that have been seen by giants like Chevron, who are now trying to put their hands on.
For a hundred years they have been researching the possibility of getting energy from the movements of the sea. In the 1970s, during the first oil crisis, research has been increasing.
Around 1980, when oil prices dropped, the idea of the use of marine energy was dismissed, but today the environmental demand and the rebound of oil prices give the industry a new boost.
The World Energy Council of London (WEC) estimates that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by seafood power plants.
This is twice as much as nuclear power plants are producing.
In addition, there will be the flow and the flow.
The giants are in place.
Enersis was the first company to commit to marine energy and in 2005 signed an agreement on a power plant to be built in Northern Portugal.
It seemed a revolutionary step when the signature was announced.
Two years have passed since, and more and more companies are voting for marine energy, including those who have so far been committed to traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying oceans’ energy technologies and considering the possibility of cooperating with us,” said a spokesman for the US oil giant’s affiliate company, the Wall Street Journal Economic Journal.
The cooperation concerns the provision of a license issued by the U.S. Energy Committee for the launch of the Alaska project for the recovery of marine energy.
This is not a bit of importance, especially if we take into account the fact that the U.S. is making oil in Alaska, and even President Bush has recently launched a plan for further burning.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. in New York and Ocean Power in New Jersey are also on the way of energy from the sea. The amounts already invested, as much as you can know about the details, prove increasing interest.
Technology is waiting for development.
According to experts, it is still an initial technology, only because the energy from the sea does not dissolve doubts about the environmental impact.
Currently existing facilities like Portugal or Scotland are all small and therefore do not cause too much problems with the ecosystem.
However, in order to produce more energy, facilities that have a significant environmental impact are needed.
There are several options: for example, Ocean Power uses an interconnected boat system.
The shots caused by the waves and moving the boys up are converted into hydraulic pressure by the locks and wheels placed in them.
The pressure rotates a turbine, which feeds a generator.
The electricity comes to the ground through the underwater cables.
At the same time, there are four similar facilities in the design phase, which are only waiting for federal permission.
The Verdant Power, with the help of the six underwater turbines on the East River in New York, has already started the production of energy for a shopping center and a parking lot.
Sometimes the movement of water rotates the leaves of the turbines, and this rotating movement feeds the generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of partners who are only waiting for permits needed to use energy.
after the waves.
Currently, the possibilities that can be exploited through the price range deserve distinctive attention.
Although this is a periodic phenomenon, the price range is more predictable than the wind, the sun, or the waves, and therefore it is considered a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, spent $7.5 million in 2008 to exploit the energy supplied by the price line. This amount is expected to rise to $35 million in 2009.
