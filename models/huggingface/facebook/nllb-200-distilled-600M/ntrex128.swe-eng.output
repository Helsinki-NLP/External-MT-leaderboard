AM in Wales are worried about coming out like a puck
Some AMs, members of the National Assembly for Wales, are confused by a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament  Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal follows plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
AM across the political spectrum is concerned about being mocked.
An AM for Labour said his group was concerned because it was rhyme with the Twp and the Pwp.
For readers who cannot speak Welsh: Twp means dumb in Welsh and pwp means bajs.
An AM for Plaid said the group was generally "dissatisfied" and had suggested other alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open" to the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, the Welsh spelling W is similar to the English spelling U in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation on the name change, said: 'The final decision on what members of the Assembly are to be called is clearly up to the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the Assembly the Parliament of Wales.
The Commission proposed the title of AM to Welsh Parliament Members (MPs) or WMP, but the MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
AM is apparently proposing other options, but problems in reaching consensus could cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the change within weeks.
The legislation for the amendments also includes other changes to the working of the Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of an AM and the design of the committee system.
The AMs are allowed to vote on their names when they debate legislation.
Macedonia holds a referendum on changing its name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is an attempt to end a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its neighbour's name represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly protested its attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonia's President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the name change referendum and has said he will ignore the results.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is the price they must pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's are silent when the churches in Harlem run into trouble
"Older people I talk to say there was a bar and a church on every corner once", Mr. Adams said.
Now there's no one.
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
"People are socializing differently these days", he said.
"Bars are no longer like the area's living rooms, where people go on a regular basis".
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not go as far as the leaders expect and that sooner or later they will end up on the same line again.
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with owner apartments filled with people who do not help the remaining churches.
The absolute majority of people buying apartments in the buildings will be white, he said.This will eventually lead to the closure of all churches, as those moving into the apartments are unlikely to become members of the churches
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, that refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson's congregation planned the renovation, they also built the clock tower.
Pastor David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the musical play "The Poor's Clock".
The expert who played the clock in July had another name for it: A cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first clock played by a black musician  Dionisio A. Lind, who moved on to the larger clock at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says St. Martin's did not replace him.
The events of the last few months at St. Martin's are a complicated story with architects and contractors, some employed by the lay staff of the church, others by the Episcopal foundation.
The church council, the governing body of the congregation composed of lay people, wrote to the foundation in July expressing concern that the foundation would try to transfer the cost to the church council, even though the church council had not been involved when the foundation employed architects and contractors.
Some members of the congregation complained of a lack of transparency from the foundation.
Shark hurts 13-year-old boy who's diving for lobster in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was falling for lobster in California on the first day of lobster season, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been digging with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying out for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he thought at first that the boy was just happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming: "I've been bitten!"
I've been bitten!
When Hammel reached the boy, he noticed that the entire key had been torn.
"I called everyone to get out of the water. "There's a shark in the water!" Hammel told me.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is listed in critical condition.
It's unclear what kind of sharks it was.
Battalion Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had spotted the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said the victim suffered traumatic injuries to his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swamis in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is entering the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is taking on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-like beauty rides with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into the UK beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the decline of the fashion and home markets, the larger beauty trends will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented in more stores next year if successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the department store's attempt to fill the shelves previously occupied by TVs, microwave ovens and household products.
Sainsbury's said they're planning to double their beauty offerings to up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing offerings from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space with marked areas, such as in shops like Boots.
The chain is also re-launching its boutique jewellery brand, with most of its products being vegan, which is what more and more young customers are demanding.
In addition, fragrance shop will test stalls in two Sainsbury's stores, the first one opening in Croydon, south London last week and the second one in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the trend of buying smaller quantities of food every day in local shops mean that fast-food stores must do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their stores will look more like department stores in an attempt to fight off cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat stores since they bought both chains two years ago, which they say has increased food sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
Previously, the fast-food chain's attempts to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a facelift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was terminated after a dispute over how the proceeds from Boots' sales in the grocery store would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, who owns the chain Lloyd's Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
They claim that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial manager, said: "We've given our beauty rides a new look and feel to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who can advise clients.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet every need, and with an appealing environment in smooth places, we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is astonished after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the £11 million deal.
Dragon's Den star Peter Jones is astonished that TV presenter Holly Willoughby is pulling out of an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby's not up to date with their Truly brand, with casual wear and accessories.
Their activities have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning anchor announced her decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragon's Den star Peter Jones furious by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was shocked at a tense meeting at his business empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favourite admitted that her new deal worth up to £1.5 million meant she could no longer focus on their Truly brand, with leisure clothing and accessories.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew to one of her vacation homes.
One source said, "Truly was clearly Holly's top priority.
It would be her long-term future for decades to come.
Her decision to withdraw shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold at Marlow headquarters.
Experts believe that the decision by This Morning to withdraw could cost the company several million dollars due to significant investments in everything from pillows and lights to clothing and the risk of further delays in launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three, Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, took over as chairman in March.
The couple is on vacation together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: "We're not commenting on his business activities".
♪ We had a hard talk ♪ And then we fell in love ♪
He joked that the mass media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider "worth a president" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a news anchor:
I haven't given up on anything.
He said Kim wants a second meeting after Trump celebrated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea's nuclear weapons.
But the nuclear arms negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore meeting in June, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "conversing response" from the United States after North Korea's first disarmament step.
He noted that the United States, instead, continued sanctions designed to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his supporters.
"It's going great with North Korea", he said.
We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a wonderful relationship.
He said his attempts to improve his relationship with Kim have been successful... ending rocket tests, releasing the hostages and returning the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people here", Trump said, pointing to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate island in Indonesia, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although over 10 percent of Lombok's population had lost their homes, no state of emergency was declared, which is required for international assistance.
"In many cases they have unfortunately been very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, which complicates the whole thing", Ms Sumbung said.
The rescued children are assembling a team to travel to Palu, but it is still unclear if foreign personnel can work there.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the Natural Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to decide whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the relief work.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still sadly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Tsunami protection has been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The absence of a tsunami warning virus in Palu, despite a warning, likely contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions, traveling between Indonesia's many islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and railways.
But a lack of funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration ahead of next year's election.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from the growing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, arrows and other primitive weapons.
Look at this. Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge has a last-minute receipt against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge was given a pass by Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal when his team was 1-0 down.
He moved the ball to the left and scooped a kick at the back of the pole.
The test flew high above the target area towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga's hopes and landed in the net.
"I was just trying to get in a position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching and didn't think much about it. I just kicked.
Chelsea led 1-0 after the first half after a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striper poured a pass back into Mateo Kovacic, spinning off close to midfield and running to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go in the middle.
Then he got a super kick that put Hazard in the target range.
Hazard ran away from the defense and got the ball into the net at the back of the pole with a left foot kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea will play VIdeot in the UEFA Europa League in London at 3pm on Thursday.
Death toll from tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster bureau early Sunday.
Many people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday, triggering waves of up to six metres, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was filled with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with a knife wound at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who saw or heard anything to step forward.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said, "We're in the early stages of the investigation, but I'm asking anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is critical to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman found was a resident of Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police are notifying the victim's immediate family.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to break into his apartment, but the police said no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was left speechless when he found out what had happened.
The occupants of the building have been informed that it will take several hours for them to re-enter.
A police officer told a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene crying.
She says it's so terrible over and over again.
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police cars inside the barrier and another just outside.
A number of police officers were inside the block with a view of the apartment building.
Persons with information are requested to send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from 30 September.
Parliament statue of Cromwell latest victim of the dispute over rewriting history
A ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "dumbness" and "attempts to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be drawn into the ongoing debate on removing statues".
The iconic class of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Cromwell reflects the 19th-century view of and is part of the historiography of a man who many still consider to be worthy of praise.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than now, believe that Cromwell defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case from the monarchy.
Whether this is a correct representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict of the mid-17th century has undoubtedly affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known figure who represents one side of the issue.
His achievements as Lord Protector deserve praise and celebration as well.
Slayer pigs kill farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, local media reports said.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a ruptured artery and covered in blood in a stove at a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into pigs in a pigsty on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby pigsty was open.
He said there was a big pigsty in the pigsty with blood on its mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-pound pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and twisted", the cousin, who is identified by the surname Wu, told Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera caught Yuan coming to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to avoid further attacks while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yu's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
It's rare for pigs to attack humans, but it's happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound pig stuck a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a catalyst.
They're just playful.
They're very curious and they don't want to hurt anyone.
He said you just have to show them respect.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa for extensive heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa will weaken as it travels over cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring floodwaters to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had winds of up to 135 km/h, Category 1, at 5 pm EST on Sunday and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a train is forming across the Pacific Ocean and traveling eastward toward the west coast of the United States, and as Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching rainfall will create extensive heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Locally, 2.510 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, mudflow and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 57.5 cm of rain per hour in some places, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 510 cm of rain is expected in some places in the southwestern United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread tropical rain.
It is absolutely not recommended that anyone walk out into the desert when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into rivers, and thunderstorms can cause strong local winds to blow around sand.
The approaching storm is bringing with it some local heavy rainfall to parts of the coastline of southern California.
This is possible with a total of over one centimetre of rainfall, which can lead to mudflow and rough roads.
It would be the first rainfall in the area during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before rain spreads more later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
October could mean intense temperature changes across the United States, as the Arctic cools but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
There's a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States on Sunday.
That's almost 10 degrees of difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to get a warm start in October with temperatures ranging from the Great Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York could get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high chance of warmer than average temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the interview with Brett Kavanaugh.
Over 20 million watched Thursday's arresting testimony from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault allegedly occurred in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued and normal broadcasting was interrupted for Friday's last-minute twist. Arizona Senator Jeff Flake's deal with the FBI gave them a week to investigate the charge.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's pretty sure Kavanaugh was waving at her when he was drunk and trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony saying he was absolutely sure that didn't happen.
It's likely that the number of viewers on Friday was higher than the 20.4 million reported by Nielsen.
They counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available to other television networks that showed the interview, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble counting people who watch from offices.
By comparison, there are as many viewers as there are for a football game in the grand final or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest viewership with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long interview, according to Nielsen.
ABC was the second most watched with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the interrogation.
Flake was the focus of Friday's drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed protesters screaming at him as he tried to take an elevator to a Judiciary Committee hearing on Friday morning.
He stared down on the floor for several minutes while the protesters shouted at him, which was shown live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed he said he would have more to say after the committee hearing.
The television networks broadcast live hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted on whether to pass Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote by the entire Senate.
But Flake said he only intended to do so if the FBI were to investigate the charges against the nominee within the next week, as the minority Democrats have demanded.
Flake was partially persuaded by his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had a big impact, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'political games' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing "political games" about Britain's future and undermining the nation's interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the paper, her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's customs duties was "completely unreasonable".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation and police said Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
Police found the glasses on the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After Simpson was interviewed, the police said he confessed to shooting Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to Advocate.
The medical examiner for East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report Friday, stating the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The police are grateful to the Louisiana State Police's escape task force, the state police's law enforcement agency, the Southern University police department and residents of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their hard work and commitment to justice.
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-1, 200-pound forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "crossed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You worry about this all the time", Wade said.
The volcano is spewing ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and they recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash over the course of 24 hours.
The center detected several mudslides and quakes.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on windmills in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with police demands while thousands took part in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing secession vote.
A group of masked separatists held back by the police threw eggs and paint powder at them, leading to dark clouds of dust on streets usually filled with tourists.
Fighting broke out later in the day, and police used their batons to stop them.
For hours, the independence groups cried out 'Never forget, never forgive' while the unionists cried out 'Long live Spain'.
14 people were treated for minor injuries caused by the protests, according to local press.
The situation is still tense in the region, which is longing for independence a year after the referendum on October 1 that was considered illegal by Madrid but hailed by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted for independence, but turnout was low as most opposed to secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to stop the vote at elections in the region.
Independent groups camped in the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but they had to take a different route.
Electrician Narcis Termes, 68, joined the separatist protest with his wife and said he no longer believes Catalonia will become independent.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for the joy of being able to vote, but now we're stuck, he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal win in regional elections in December, Catalan independence parties have had a hard time keeping up this year, with many of their most well-known leaders living in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial over their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on her cell phone, said the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
He said it's getting more and more tense.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in power since the end of last year, announced that he would be running for the European Parliament election next year.
Candidating for the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the subjugation we have experienced from the Spanish government, he said.
London: Arrested after car breaks into houses
Three men 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent, around 7:30pm BST on Thursday.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
A bracelet may have even been fired at the car.
Menga gives Livingston 1-0 to the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win.
Livingston shocked the Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Meng's strike proved to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was split second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side still hasn't got a clear win in the Premier League this season and they're facing the Hearts, eight points clear, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna to the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston extends his winning streak to six games. Head coach Holt still hasn't lost since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston is missing out on two visitors.
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before they scored; their fairness gave the Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dropped his performance across the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot wide after slipping in to measure Craig Halkett's nod across the goal.
The home team settled for letting the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could attack in certain games.
And that's how the crucial goal was made.
The Rangers gave up a free throw and Livingston took advantage of an opening, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to give Menga a shot, which he scored from the middle of the field.
In that situation, the Rangers had dominated the ball, but the home team's defense was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely left in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied the Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide from another of Livingston's determined games.
Crossings were constantly coming into Livingston's area of focus and were handled without problems, with two criminal charges being dropped after Halkett's challenge by exchanger Glenn Middleton and one for hands.
Fenomenal from Livingston  analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
This is a phenomenal performance and results for Livingston.
Each one was exceptional and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their playing style and staff have barely changed since they returned to the upper level, but Holt deserves the honor of having galvanized the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding, leading a skilfully organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on full throttle straight through.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their moments under Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball didn't hold the meter. They only opened the home page once. And it's kind of a wake-up call for the Rangers, which is in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
Saturday was a smiling and blue sky (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany  to repair relations between NATO allies.
They have become disagreeable about human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside Turkey.
Police claimed they prevented 25,000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters  many of them Kurdish  also made their voices heard and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The dueling protests show the divided views of a visitor who is considered a hero by some German Turks and condemned as a monopoly ruler by others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist has died in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and paramedics were called to the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The crash comes months after another cyclist died in a collision on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's crash.
Metropolitan Police said they're trying to identify the man and notify his immediate family.
Roads have been blocked, buses have been diverted and drivers are being asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards wounded in riots
Six prison guards have been injured in riots at a maximum security prison for men, according to the Prison Office.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30am on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialised storm watchmen have been called in to deal with the unrest, involving eight prisoners on a wing.
The guards were treated on site for minor facial injuries.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been sent there to handle the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those behind it will be referred to the police and may face imprisonment for longer.
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was being treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, the police were called to the prison to handle a serious riot where staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (those areas with drought may benefit)
It is rare for tropical low pressure to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen early next week as the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa extends across the deserts of the southwestern United States, with the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to make her direct crossing over Phoenix on Tuesday, bringing rain late on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only 20 tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm status or low pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of the Arizona border.
The National Hurricane Center's latest models predict 510 cm of rainfall, with isolated amounts up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwestern United States, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 2.55 cm of rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas where there is no risk of sudden flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing, since the region is affected by drought.
Flooding is very serious, but some of the rain is likely to be beneficial because the southwestern United States suffers from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reported.
Hurricane Rosa will first travel over the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with storm strength on Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north at 20 km/h.
The storm is hitting cooler waters in the Pacific, calming it down.
It is therefore expected to reach the Mexican mainland as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico may experience heavy rainfall, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
A total of 7.515 cm of rain is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm, weather.com reported.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the deserts of the southwestern United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
Rainfall is expected to lead to life-threatening flash floods and mudslides in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 P.M. on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and is reported to be in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police are asking anyone who may have filmed what happened to the cell phone to step forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh's leadership, the evil, the anger of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to condemn the ruthlessness and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump told supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered from the viciousness, anger, of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that he sexually assaulted her decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified before Congress about his accusation.
The President said Saturday that the American people saw the brilliance and quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice to affirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to affirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a first-rate history of public service", he told his supporters in the West Virginia audience.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming midterm elections.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm running, he said.
That's why I'm going around fighting for great candidates.
Trump claimed the Democrats were trying to resist and prevent it.
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to information to CNN from an aide to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds of dead in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, numbers rising
At least 384 people died, many swept away when giant waves hit the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves up to six meters high crashed into the beach at dusk, sweeping many to a safe death and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami came after a 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people stopped on the beach instead of running away immediately, and they fell victim to the tsunami", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster agency, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"The tsunami was not alone, but it brought cars, logs and houses, and it hit everything in its path", Nugroho said.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are warped and have collapsed, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Subsequent quakes were still affecting the coastal town on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's BPPT Technology Assessment and Application Agency said in a statement that the amount of energy released in the massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times the amount of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the devastation as "comprehensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
He said dead victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is nearest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication from Donggala was completely paralyzed with no information, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse", they said.
The agency was criticized on Saturday for not informing the tsunami had struck Palu, but authorities said the waves had appeared within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard shouting frantic tsunami warnings to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water collapses against the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off all communication around Palu, making rescue work difficult for the authorities.
The military has begun sending cargo flights there with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but evacuees are still in dire need of food and other supplies.
The city's airport has been opened for relief work and will remain closed to other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is more than 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision employees in Donggala have taken to Palu to seek shelter under the barracks outside the office, but they saw devastation along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses", he said.
It's really bad.
Aid groups have begun the acute relief effort, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad may only be used if a state of emergency is declared after a disaster.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a regional disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the authorities say it is a national disaster, we can release international aid, but that status has not yet been declared.
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of missing people were still hoping that their loved ones would prove to be the miracles that illuminate the gloomy natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been stuck in a rush for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of Indonesia's national fighter squad, had trained two of the missing fighters for the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a screen-flight veteran, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr Gendon said that hours after the airline heard that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants attending the beach festival.
But his messages only got one gray bowl instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered", he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM refills at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who filled a ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from Newport police.
The driver of the car had emptied a ATM at the entertainment facility and was to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, another man jumped up behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, according to the press release, but police did not say how many were involved in the incident.
Anybody with information regarding the identity of the perpetrators should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
He announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday, saying: "The creature formally known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been known as Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who withdrew for "emotional reasons", according to the show's creator.
Ye is an abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think ye is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means du, West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am us, that's us.
It went from Kanye, which means "the only one", to just Ye, a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is like a reflection of who we are.
He's one of a number of famous rappers who've changed their name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy before, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously collaborated with West, has written his name with and without a band-band and versales.
AMLO of Mexico vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's recently elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use the military against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he would never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
Troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 600 people during an era when left-wing student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans with monthly student grants and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double AI funding
Now that China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in the field, according to inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the US government have made statements about AI, despite the US not having a comprehensive formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
A budget twice that big could double the chance of the next big AI breakthrough being made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published earlier this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later he was in charge of Microsoft Research and CEO of Google's China division.
Lee mentioned previous technology competitions from the U.S. government, like the Robot Challenge from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what would be next to be able to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, scientists often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders away from us, it's the corporations", Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university executives to work on AI.
Lee said new immigration policies could also help the U.S. with AI innovation.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhD students in AI", he said.
The State Council of China issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation grants grants to individuals at academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government agencies that provide funding to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
American legislation that would create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has made no progress in months.
The Macedonian referendum on the name change
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has hampered its attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim to its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the name change would undermine the identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the minimum 50% required to validate the referendum will be achieved.
The question on the ballot in the referendum is: 'Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the agreement with Greece?'
But supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth changing the name if it will allow Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia split, to join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for the youth of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means safer lives for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said they intend to follow the result to be considered decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority of the parliament.
According to the State Election Commission, no irregularities were reported at 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I am voting for my children, we belong in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko, vote in the referendum in Macedonia on the name change of the country, which would pave the way for NATO and European Union membership, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Outside the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents set up by those who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go with our heads in the air, not sneak in through the back door", Kavardarkov said.
We're a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration.
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership would lead to much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
I think the absolute majority will vote yes, because over 80% of our citizens are for the EU and NATO, Zaev said when he voted.
He said a "yes" result would be a "confirmation" of our future.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters thought to vote in the referendum, which falls below the minimum required turnout.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of respondents thought they would vote on Sunday.
70% of them would vote yes.
To count the referendum, 50% of registered voters plus one vote must be counted.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious setback for the policy of the Western-focused government since it took over in May last year.
Look at this. Manchester City's Sergio Aguero is taking his way through Brighton's defense to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's proposal in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker was given a pass from the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three of Brighton's three defenders and took the field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He surrounded one defender and ran away from several others on the edge of Brighton's target range.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling's left.
The English forward used his first kick in the goal area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero has foot problems", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing for 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal in that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the opening lead in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area that game.
He sent a nice kick down the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the other pole.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net the moment before it fell out of reach.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play the Rockies.
The Nationals have been eliminated from the playoffs, so there was no reason to force a re-entry.
But competitive-minded Scherzer wants to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, still have a chance at the playoffs.
The Rockies got a wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still looking for their first division title.
We're not playing for anything, but we might get a chance to rub rub rubber in the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the other team would play at a higher level than any other team I'd meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?
The Nationals haven't announced their start for Sunday yet, but reports suggest they're inclined to let Scherzer pitch under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who was to make his 34th start, warmed up in the bullpen Thursday and was to throw in his normal rest Sunday.
Washington's right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is giving a speech in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming midterm elections.
Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not running, but I'm running, which is why I'm going around fighting for great candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "You see a terrible, terrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right here and now.
They are determined to take back power whatever it takes, you see their wickedness, their horror.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take over power and control, that's what they want, power and control.
Democrats, he said, are fighting to resist and prevent.
"You've seen it for the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "bad and mean and terrible and fake".
He mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was met with high praise from viewers.
Do you remember what she said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, no, I'm expecting a... That was really bad body language, one of the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They don't tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
I am, after all, the last of a number of Labour MPs to hear that we are not welcome just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she spoke out against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe  ironically similar to the topics Jeremy criticised earlier leaders for.
The notice of the meeting with Nottingham East Labour on Friday stated that we want the meetings to be welcoming and productive.
For most of my eight years as Labour's local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been just that.
But unfortunately many meetings are not, and the promise of friendlier, more political policies has long been forgotten, if ever it began.
It has become increasingly clear that dissenting opinions are not tolerated within Labour, and any opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party leader accepts it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I previously believed had a similar political viewpoint that I expected me to make a complete change and take positions I would otherwise never have taken on whether it was national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I speak publicly  and it really doesn't matter what I say  there is a barrage of social media dissent that demands my removal, criticizes my policy and says I shouldn't even be in Labour.
And this isn't just about me.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues when they face a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the biggest disappointments with the policies of this era is the level of insults that are now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality we are no longer this broad church and with every mistrust and change in the selection rules the party becomes ever tighter.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too straight forward, so it's okay.
But that's not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a schoolteacher 32 years ago, provoked by Thatcher's government's neglect which literally caused my primary school classrooms to collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most  both at local level and as a government minister.
I've never hidden my political views, and that includes the recent election.
No one in Nottingham East can have been in any way confused by my views on policies and topics where I disagree with the current leadership.
To you who made the demand on Friday, I just want to say that when the country is heading for a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and public services, I don't understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency  Labour members and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of impeachment or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is MP for Nottingham East
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr on top
Two last-minute attempts may have distorted the outcome a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this gloriously entertaining Tennents Premiership match.
They're on top now, the only undefeated side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, that gave the home team the win, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our matches so far and are still undefeated, so we're obviously happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "They deserve it, they took better chances than us".
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, and at the end of the first half he scored and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, cut the lead to five points.
It then became a long wait after a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was knocked off the pitch, and after the reboot Ayr increased the lead again with an attempt from Stafford McDowall, who was converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair MacPherson was then given a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of tremendous pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touchdown from the penalty line-out behind Ayr's mouth.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent off flank Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth try.
Still Game star seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems poised to break into the restaurant business after it was discovered he's been named CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and stars in alongside his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The Duon has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' final, and Kiernan seems to be planning for a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, but a source on Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan wanted to get into Glasgow's thriving restaurant business.
The sea belongs to us: Coastal Bolivia hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific again
Seamen are patrolling a rigged naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have a sea blue flag.
The fleet's bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it.
In coastal Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still strong, and there is also the longing to sail again in the Pacific.
This hope is higher than it has been for decades now, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has a spirit of unity and peace and is certainly looking forward to the outcome with a positive attitude", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice's decision on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favor of Bolivia's demand that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, must negotiate with Bolivia to allow it its own exit to the sea.
Monday's decision is also of great importance to Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president who faces a controversial re-election campaign next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is incredible that the court ruled in favor of Bolivia, and that even if it did, little would be changed.
The United Nations Court of Justice, based in the Netherlands, has no right to assign Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible discussions.
The fact that the decision was announced only six months after the final arguments suggested that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years may have hurt rather than boosted Bolivia's chances.
The question of access to the sea has been overlooked by the current Bolivian administration, said Zárate.
She claims Morales' aggressive rhetoric has affected Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, did not consider the court's decision to have been taken unusually quickly.
Monday will provide Bolivia with an exceptional opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to put an end to 139 years of disagreements of mutual benefit, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the issue of the sea as a political bait.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean", he said.
The decision is a chance to realize that we have to move on from the past.
North Korea says nuclear weapons require trust in the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says the nation will not disarm its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the pledges made at a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of resolving the deadlock in nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says it's a "dream" to continue sanctions and U.S. protests against a statement that ending the Korean War will ever tame North Korea.
Washington is hesitant to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first initiating significant nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is really going to get rid of an arsenal of weapons that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line huge headlines on the way to shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a range of crusty, oversized headgear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which blinded the styling at Paris Fashion Week.
Incredibly impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent their eye-catching creations off the catwalk.
Valentino's main creation was an exaggerated beige hat with a feather-like wide hat board that completely took over the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-picked watermelons, a witch hat and even a pineapple but they are not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre mosquitoes, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lipstick and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creature resembled a wet suit of snorkel and a diving mask, and another looked like a molten glass straw.
And if you continue with that tremendous courage, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hats may be heading to stores near you.
The oversized hats come shortly after the 60cm wide straw hat from La Bomba, which has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the incredibly impractical hat that has taken over social media sent out another big creature on the catwalk  a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the bathing suit that held it.
The raffia bag in terracotta, with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, stood out in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer. The designer has had such an impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills essential to global citizens
The Scottish Independent Schools maintain outstanding academic performance and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, only reinforced by individual and collective progress in sport, the arts, music and other community engagement.
With up to 30,000 pupils in Scotland, the schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best possible service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen careers and their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement tailored curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and in demand in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.
It's a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English when we build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's results show that languages are at the top of the list, with the highest number of accredited grades in independent schools.
Overall, 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received A's in the final exam.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students studying Mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French, and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language choice is now considered as important as natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics in curricula in independent schools and beyond.
A survey conducted by the UK's Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that employers had difficulty filling their vacant positions for various reasons, with 17 percent being attributed to a lack of language skills.
With that said, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career path they choose, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 British adults published by YouGov in 2013, 75 percent said they could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation in it, and French was the only language that made up a two-digit percentage overall (15 percent).
That is why it is so important to invest in language education for our children.
Being able to speak several languages, especially those spoken in developing countries, gives your child a better chance of finding meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland, every school will teach different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach in languages considered most important to the UK by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Independent schools in Scotland strive to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In a global economic environment, language is undoubtedly still crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should indeed be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's youth.
It's good to be fair.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is making his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he's playing is yet to be determined.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' preseason schedule.
"I don't need pre-season play at this stage of my career to be ready", he said.
Trump's West Virginia campaign events, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is holding his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five planned appearances for Trump next week, including events in places he has a strong support for, like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Pending a confirmation vote of his Supreme Court nominee for the vacant post, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress ahead of the upcoming November election.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia campaign event is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. this Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was strained by allegations of his sexual assault, with an expected delay of the Senate vote of up to a week while the FBI's investigation of the case continues.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help Republicans get some meat on their feet before the November election.
Thus, President Trump said that these five meetings next week are meant to "engage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the Senate and House majority", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the hectic campaign period", a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Tonight's event, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday marks the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has been sloppy in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to go there to try to give him an increase in opinion polls", says Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA struggling to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the Saturday afternoon party competitions could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a completely invented sporting concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before in competitions like these.
So what momentum is this about?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we're carrying it like a little momentum, I guess", Jordan Spieth said as he finished the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points ahead with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have a little wind in their sails, but they have a lot to encourage, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and scored three points out of four each.
Spieth has been a good man from tee to green and sets a good example.
The win streak was even higher as his round continued and he lowered a decisive pitch to take the game four all-square as he and Thomas had been lying down with two games to two.
His pitcher who won them on 15 met with a similar twist, convinced that the American team is not out of the game yet.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own game", Spieth said.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to win.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's odd but adorable couple is four out of four, and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that didn't do a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These performances and the public's reactions confirm that they are the players to beat on Sunday and there is no more popular player who could commemorate a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both, simultaneously in different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefed the trial with Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, along with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on front nine plunged the Spaniards and Swedes into a hole they never even got close to crawling out of.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out.
Fourball and foursome are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead by the last day, but this four-season session also showed that Team USA has a fighting spirit that some, especially on the US side, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in the Ryder Cup final day
Europe will have a strong lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's foursome and foursome match with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over a besieged Tiger Woods and combed home four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Björn's European team, which was fighting to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that never really got off to a 3-1 start during the morning fireball.
The United States offered more resistance in the Fourth Division and won two games, but that wasn't enough for victory.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are just the second pair to score four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they beat a tired Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5 & 4.
Woods, who made it through two games on Saturday, showed a few moments of brilliance, but he's now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and foursome, including seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning foursome and returning to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes for a 2 & 1 win over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
Europe hadn't had the wind all the way, but it was a nice, windy day just southwest of Paris.
Triple-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American benchmark with two points on Saturday.
They came home victorious 2 & 1 over Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in foursome and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history have a team come back from a four-point deficit in singles matches, however Fury's side only needs an untied result to retain the trophy.
After being second best for two days, it looks like a Sunday counterattack might be hard to get through.
North Korea says it will "never" disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States and that it was not possible for the country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's annual general meeting that North Korea had taken "significant measures to show its goodwill" over the past year, including halting nuclear and missile testing, dismantling nuclear testing facilities, and promising not to disseminate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States", he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no chance that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first".
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a phased approach to nuclear power that would result in North Korea being rewarded as it stepped up, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject a unilateral nuclear disarmament solution as Pyongyang had previously done.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim promised to work toward "the dismantling of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first disarm its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected talks to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on settlement first and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose through coercion and even objects to the declaration of an end to the war", Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can get us down on our knees is a wishful thinking of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust".
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, pointing to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, the minister added: "If the party in this nuclear weapons issue were South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear weapons of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a stalemate".
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year's when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's future ability to reach the US mainland with missiles was inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but it said that much work remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying that "whether it takes two years, three years, or five months", it doesn't matter".
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The maintenance of the Security Council sanctions must continue with force and without failure until we achieve complete, final, verified disarmament".
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stifle funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him hours later of making "gang-like demands".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and even a nuclear power complex if the United States took "corresponding measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "countermeasures" he sought were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and were moving toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has all PhD students improving their sleep habits in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeinated "dips".
An academic study found that students at the world's leading universities often lack the basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after discussing the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why don't I know this until now, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first organised this year, explains to students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course includes a range of interactive tasks.
In part of the course, a picture of a student room is shown, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that it will not change the behaviour of pupils directly.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,' added Professor Czeisler.
The pride culture of "sleep" still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and the constant pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate, high-quality sleep should be the student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said - also to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the brain in a state of constant starvation.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped design Professor Czeisler's course and has taken one of his courses last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course was an eye-opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all PhD students to complete a similar programme of study before they begin their studies at the high performing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can turn you on 24 hours a day, leading to insomnia problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: The goal of Mengas is to lower Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Menga's strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to take home their first win on the road since February's 4-1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his side eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leader Harts.
Menga hit seven minutes into the half and the Rangers never evened out.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston is climbing to third, only behind Hibernian in goal difference.
And there may be more trouble on the line for the Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerrard made eight changes in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been happy about the way his well-maintained game shone out on the opponents each time.
The Rangers may have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
It should have been a goal two minutes into the game when Mengas' first pass passed Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big shot and shot out.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then reached team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the back of the pole.
The Rangers took control of the game, but it seemed to be more hope than belief in their game during the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morelo certainly felt he should have been punished when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but Judge Steven Thomson waved off the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers managed to score only two goals in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly took easy on Lassana Coulibaly's nick and a tam kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Livy's opening shot in the 34th minute may have been against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their maid deserved it.
Once again, the Rangers failed to handle Jacob's steady situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher matched Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrard was acting at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the switch took almost immediate effect when the surface hit the ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to get his opponents to play exactly the kind of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping up long passes after long passes.
Holt's side could have strengthened their lead in the final stage, but McGregor did manage to stop Jacobs before Lithgow took a corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton had another late penalty claim when he bumped into Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the mannequin called the Geiger meter.
Geiger meters have since become a cornerstone of science and are also a major figure in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the seemingly unlikely cowpoke researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
MAN: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals".
Evans: "Yeah, it's popping up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccin teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein common to many cancers and then re-inject it into the bloodstream.
A trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various forms of cancer.
A woman who was given the vaccine, which teaches her immune system to recognize cancer, saw her ovarian cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer", explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA cap after his SNL performance.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was pulled out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a bloody performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great cap, he rallied against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon where the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's performance was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to push West with the speech.
West had also complained to the audience that he had been harassed backstage for his head bondage.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on".
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm down, he said, according to the Washington Examinator.
West continued, "Would you like to go down too?" and said, "I'll put my supermancap on, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Test it with love".
His comments attracted more crowds from the audience at least twice, and SNL staff seemed embarrassed, reported Variety.
West had come in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with his performance of the song I Love It, disguised as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for standing up against the mob".
But the host of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply "just himself, and that's absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') who I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We're in, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "the creature formerly known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddys, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper's colleague, Snoop Dogg, has called himself Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Convicted of attempted murder by stabbing at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear at the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is battling toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword-twisting role as Jon Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has been negative about the stereotype of male heroes, saying that such roles on screen often mean that young boys feel that they must be tough to be respected.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "quite strong" to deal with the problem.
"I personally feel pretty strongly, right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men in the face of the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its highly masculine characteristics.
He continued: "What is native and what is learned?
What is taught on television and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they must be a certain way to be a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
It is clear that something has gone wrong with young men".
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be making any Game of Thrones sequels when the series ends next summer, saying he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he feels meeting his wife Rose was the best experience of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife because of the series, so that's how it gave me my future family and my future life", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, who Kits character Jon Snow falls in love with, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, health officials say.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way had dropped to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people year on year.
Sexual HIV transmission is an urgent issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will marry women sooner or later.
Many of the cases of infection are due to insufficient protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff leaked GOP senator data, blaming "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that one of her employees had posted personal information on three Republican U.S. senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these claims were spread by right-wing extremist websites.
"Lies, lies and more repugnant lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual assault against the nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and released the information about a member of Waters staff, Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
'My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims - were not in any way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie".
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is cruel", wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
They can't be defiant.
They shall not question the motives of the appellant.
They must be calm and sane".
Fleischer appeared to be trying to match Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of acting angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to remove Waters in the middle of his term, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had "warned the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", she continued, "and that they are held legally responsible for all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees".
Johnny English Strikes Again - powerless spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit rewards in every new British-language film, and the same seems to apply to this new recording of the latest Johnny English action comedy - a series of spy parodies that kicked off in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is there a satire about how obviously bad we are to become the nation's new export commodity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has been granted his licence to dance to sake renewed for the second time - his name signals more than anything that he is a broad comic creation intended for biographical publications even in non-English speaking countries
He's obviously the crack-ass secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour, has been given a little piece of Clouseau, a little Mr. Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
He's also originally based on the traveler and international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials that create chaos wherever he goes.
There's a moment or two of greatness in the latest JE movie.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the rotor blade briefly hit his helmet.
Atkins' talent for physical comedy is shown, but the humor feels rather low and oddly superfluous, especially since the "serious" film labels like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's adapted for children rather than adults, and to me, Johnny English's strange recordings are not as inventive and focused as Atkins' silent film exploits of the role of Bean.
The constant theme is that Britain is now in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the UK's top-secret web of spies, revealing the identities of all UK agents out in the field, to the agency's great discontent -- a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the final straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and hard-working figure, already suffering from a complete collapse of her political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but the script offers little to work with.
Her intelligence advisor informs her that when every single active spy is busy, she must use someone who's retired.
And that means the stuttering Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as a teacher at some well-off institution, but who offers unofficial lessons in the art of working undercover beside the.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his long-time sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine, a jolly hockey stick roll where Vicki Pepperdine is close to wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so horribly wrong at Her Majesty's Secret Service and run into Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister will be hard on the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer crap: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of pathetic upheavals: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a bottle-featured French restaurant; they create chaos while smuggling aboard Volta's luxury boat; and English triggers pure anarchy as he tries to use a VR headset to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta's house.
There is certainly a lot of work behind the latter sequence, but despite the charm and speed of the film, it has an air of children's TV around it.
Pretty moderately everything as a whole.
And like the other Johnny English films, I can't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies that they are developing a plan for Britons to work four days a week but get paid five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is considering a radical plan that would require the British to work four days a week - but get paid five.
The party is reportedly seeking that business leaders pass on the savings made by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but keep the same salary.
Sources say the idea would "fit" with the party's economic agenda in favour of workers.
The trade union organisation Trades Union Congress has approved the shift to a four-day week as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior Labor official told The Sunday Times: "A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year".
"It will not be done in one day, but a four-day workweek is an effort that fits into the Party's attitude to balance the economy in favour of the worker and the Party's overall industrial strategy".
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, nor would the Greens, who promised a four-day work week during their 2017 election campaign.
This objective is not, however, fully taken into account by Labour.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day workweek is not the policy of the Party and it is not something the Party agrees on".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless leaders" and "snitchers" of state-owned enterprises.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies cannot get their full stake back, as a Labour government can make " deductions " because of what they consider to have been wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on corporate boards and to create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds where 10% of the private company's equity is transferred to its employees, who will receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell on the television show "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency's investigations could lead some Republican senators to change their minds on the matter.
In an interview that aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would lead to their change of heart.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course", Kennedy said.
"I said when I entered the hearing, "I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after the allegation came out, and I said, "Have you done it?"
He was determined, convinced, unambiguous".
Graham's voice seems unshakable, though.
"I've already made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all her names could not verify it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing".
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an enormously impressive array of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; to fight global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people march to Central Park's Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goal: to fight extreme poverty by 2030.
According to a 2012 statement, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you weren't ready to pay for a VIP ticket), concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or otherwise meaningfully helping to raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel they're making a real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen reports that more than 19 million "acts" have been recorded from its supporters who have fought for a variety of goals.
It says that these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established a specific target for the measures in question.
The group estimates that the assets raised to date have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership between investors and actors committed to "helping children develop to their full potential", which pledged to give Rwanda $35 million to help fight the region's malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make social injustice as undernourishment a footnote in history", Partnership Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures were taken to require the UK to improve the diet of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which includes nutrition programmes targeting 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the common questions on their website: "What makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?"
Global citizen responded: "It's going to be a long and difficult road - sometimes we're going to fail and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year's event in New York City, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use its fleet in a "blockade" to block Russian energy exports, Interior Minister says
The government could use its fleet "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy players from entering markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, quoted by the Washington Examinator.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern parts of Europe", he said.
And he says there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that shipping lanes are kept open and, if necessary, to apply blockades to ensure that their energy does not reach the market", he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event, which was organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group calling itself the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are indeed the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and exchange fuels", he said, referring to Russia as a "day lander" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statements come after the Trump administration has aimed to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, to replace Russia, the far cheaper alternative for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
They claim that Washington's opposition to the project is only driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was backed by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly dislike the interference of a third party in our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "regular thinker" if she's to run in the 2020 presidential election, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take a "really thoughtful" look at her participation in the presidential election after the midterm elections in the United States.
During a city council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running for office.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our fractured government, and that includes a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will be taking a serious look at running for president".
Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the House of Representatives meeting, saying he "taken this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy", she said.
Warren has been frank in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We obviously need an FBI investigation before we vote".
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters did not believe she would run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "faithful" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidate for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palin from her PTSD at the Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through now that he's back, I can relate to other families who have experienced PTSD and some of the trauma that our soldiers come back with", she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the "elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back like other people, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military, have given to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, attempted obstruction of a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in intoxicated condition, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang-related or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a friend-of-the-court application Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full names of the plaintiffs in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the police have not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and his violent gang members' sons" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
State lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries that produce large numbers of asylum seekers, as nations facing major gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy amended a 2014 immigration decision that allowed illegal immigrants to seek asylum to flee domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a provision is contrary to that principle", according to the friend-of-the court report.
Lawyers further argued in the report that policies that deny immigrant entry harm the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "deliver the necessary workforce".
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered asylum judges to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said when the policy was announced on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll doubles in the hunt for survivors
For the survivors, the situation seemed increasingly grim.
"It feels very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her fever-stricken son in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
The ambulance is picking up dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is a scarce resource".
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rooting through water-damaged property and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were damaged in the 7.5 earthquake, were crowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to continued strong tremors.
With tears in his eyes, he told me that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We couldn't get away.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, I think, and Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe".
US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American daily about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China Daily paying a surcharge to the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to participate in the US 6th congressional election, a claim China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign from Washington aimed at putting pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with increased tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa who support Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a debate article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "is now doubling the bullying by placing propaganda ads in our own free press".
"The Chinese government uses America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press to spread propaganda by publishing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register", wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, in the newsstand on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economy, because the media is ruled by the Chinese Communist Party with iron hands", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers snapped at the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which.
Republicans are scaring away female voters for midterm elections through Kavanaugh fiasco, analysts warn
Since many top Republicans are defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault charges, analysts have warned that a backlash, especially from women, will occur in the upcoming election.
The sentiment on this issue has been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the election.
"It's impossible to turn back the clock", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake's last attempt at an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow and not November", says Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is Coming!" as they demonstrated in the lobby of the Senate building when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go to the roof", Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's been high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among still undecided female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, although they dislike the president, often do not vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony of sexual assault allegations against the nominee for Supreme Court, analysts suggested a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed through the confirmation.
"This has become a confusing mess for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets through, it's about how Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her", Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA, a group that helps democratic campaigns, told the news channel.
But Americans in general seem to be divided over who to believe in the wake of the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, and the latter seems to be the one they believe the most.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or likely believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt that Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressures from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as those of at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh violently assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed her genitals to her while they attended a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "world dominance".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solids technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is to bring the resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a number of software developers to work on the project and a group of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are put on the high end overnight.
"We're not asking them for permission".
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality over the past few months.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era of the web", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I
The only priest in the Church of England to be awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the Medal for his actions during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had been awarded the most prestigious award in the British military.
A memorial stone was uncovered by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather was awarded the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns".
He later rushed up to the line of fire and led the line with "great courage" before deciding the battle alone.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I am very humble about".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very honored to play a part in the parade" and added that "a true hero's courage is demonstrated by the support that many people will give".
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 and instead got to see Greta Gris
Imagine this, you've been up all night watching Bellator 206 just to be denied access to the main event.
The San Jose show featured 13 matches, including six on the main card and was broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the show was suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were little impressed after staying up in the early morning hours to watch the game.
One fan on Twitter described the change to a children's cartoon as "a sick joke".
"It was the government's decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they had to switch to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Crying pig, yeah"
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we'll be able to find a solution to the reprisal", Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the change in programming upset many.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical flaw.
But it was actually a state issue.
I can promise you, it won't happen next time.
We're going to be showing five games instead of six, which we normally do, and we've been taking a lot of water over our heads in our quest to please the fans.
It is an unfortunate situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley was considered "inferior" because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that his sexuality made him feel inferior to his peers during his childhood - but it also motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize he wasn't like everyone else until he was in high school".
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that he cared less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The regular host of the popular show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
During his one-off appearance on Laverne's first program, Daley tells how he felt "less valuable" than others during his childhood, because it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said: "This feeling of inferiority and of being different has been a real source of strength and power to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "someone", he said, so that he wouldn't let everyone down when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile advocate for LGBT rights, using her performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he took the word because he felt lucky to live openly without restrictions and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said his love affair with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "came as a surprise".
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age", he said - he participated in his first Olympics as a 14-year-old and his father died of cancer three years later - it was hard to find anyone of his age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole outlook on life" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning gold", he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie".
His son shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad wouldn't accept his death and one of the last things he had asked was if they would get their tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - where he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him: you won't be able to sit in the front row, Daddy", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally admitted that he wasn't invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a home crowd in an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling", he said.
It also inspired his first song - Proud by Heather Small - a song that had followed him to the Olympics and still gave him a stir.

Mickelson in shape on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but then he'll have to fix his form to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, playing for the 12th time in a row, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner spent his day between playing hockey and practicing his game in hopes of getting a chance to show off his skills.
He's never been the straightest driver, not even at the peak of his career, and the 48-year-old is not fit for the tough course at Le Golf National, where the long-running call often punishes misses hard.
It's not just the track that's discouraging, in the ninth game on Sunday Mickelson meets champion Francesco Molinari, who along with rookie Tommy Fleetwood won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points short of the first 12 singles, have a winning record, Mickelson's game could be decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not because he could say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, slapped me on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"There's nothing wrong with his confidence.
He's a celebrity, and he's made so much of an impact on these teams in previous seasons and this past week.
I probably didn't think he'd make it through two games.
I thought he'd do more, but now it's what it is, and we're gonna have to settle for it.
He wants to be out there, like everyone else".
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully lived up to the heights of his individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-time losses, but Furyk said his presence brought other qualities to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's smart, he likes to joke with people and he's a good guy to have on the team", he explained.
"I also think the younger players found it fun to play against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He adds so much more than just games".
Captain Thomas Bjorn of Europe knows that the great leadership may soon be a memory only
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in the final day singles of the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in a 1997 game at Valderrama, where a team under the leadership of Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans but ultimately won by the lowest margin possible with a score of 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"You're reminded that we led big at Valderrama, we led big at Brookline where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won hard and fast", Bjorn (pictured) said after watching the 2018 class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll give it all away.
Go out and do everything right.
This isn't over until we see the point on the board.
Our goal is to try and win this trophy, and that's where our focus is.
I've said it all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're well aware of what's waiting on the other side - the best players in the world".
Bears was satisfied with his players' performance on a tough golf course and added: "I would never do this alone.
Tomorrow we have new challenges ahead of us.
Tomorrow, it's the individual achievements that matter, and it's a whole different matter.
It's fun to be out with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there on your own, your golfing skills are tested to the full.
That's the message you need to convey to the players, to bring out the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must go out and get the best out of himself".
Unlike Bear, opponent Jim Furyk will want players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who came home three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of major upsets in the last few days of a competition, both on the winning team in Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe drove the "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word of it", he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, had gathered his players for the final day.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you'd like to go out as fast as you do at Brookline, as you do at Medinah.
When the pace starts in one direction, there's a lot of pressure on these midfielders.
We did our setup and placed the guys we wanted to, you know, create some magic tomorrow".
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the game and will face Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will face the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this arrangement because I think it's enough all the way", Bjorn said of his singles choices.
Germany's new warships are delayed again
The newest frigate of the German Navy was to have been launched in 2014 to replace Cold War warships, but it will not be launched until at least next year due to faulty systems and high costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the fleet as early as 2014, but the problems arising after delivery were fatal to the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen frigates.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a range of air defense and naval missiles, as well as some concealed techniques, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the latest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuing delays mean that the groundbreaking warships - which allow Germany to project power abroad - are already obsolete when they enter service, writes Die Zeit.
The disastrous F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the retreat, but German media reported a number of important "software and hardware failures" that rendered the warship useless if used on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important as Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the vessel has a significant overweight, which leads to impaired performance and limits the ability of the Navy to carry out future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from the wrong hardware, the entire project pricing - including training of the crew - is also a problem.
It is said to have amounted to a fraudulent EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared with EUR 2.2 billion in the initial period.
The problems affecting the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of the recent warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the fleet was actually "beginning to lack fully equipped ships".
The official said that this was a growing problem, as old vessels were being scrapped but no replacement vessels were being provided.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is stealing the bat's secret life
New research on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow southern and dwarf pipistrels as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat noise and which species do what.
An environmental map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS's conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bat and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of environmental management activities such as nesting and how best to maintain forest land for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work affecting housing and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can aircraft and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks from domestic cats.
Bat is not actually blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when catching prey.
They use sophisticated eco-location technology to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which manages more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspections of dwellings and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at the Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here on Threave we have a good area for bats", he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of old-growth trees and a lot of favorable living environments.
But there is much about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of searching for bats before performing maintenance in real estate, as it is possible that accidental destruction of a single nest could kill up to 400 females and young, and possibly wipe out an entire population.
Bats are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, harm or disturb them or destroy their habitat.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and too many of our species are not aware of their populations".
Ronaldo denies rape as his lawyers threaten to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charges against him "fake news" and says people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese forward and Juventus forward have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In a Live video on Instagram, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "fake news" when speaking to his 142 million followers, just hours after the claims were reported.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
What they said today was fake news, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's not uncommon.
They want to be known by using my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine. "The player said and smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations, which they have called "an unauthorized reporting of suspicions of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to an amount equal to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed with Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" betrayed by the "last percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to a settlement because she felt "scared of retaliation" and was worried about "being humiliated publicly".
The 34-year-old says she's now trying to rescind the plea because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will forever regret' losing carmakers
Britain "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as the world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, said Commerce Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily cease production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese automaker announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event of no agreement could result in job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stop at our factory", says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems with what carmakers say are the risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on an 'just-in-time' basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for cars ordered.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, it could lead to border disruptions that industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's consumption in stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would therefore be forced to stop.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "precisely calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that allows, as I say, not only the success of the present to be appreciated now, but for us to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The predictions from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain set".
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but warned in the longer term that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the Unite union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "My experience is that these jobs will never come back.
A government official said: "We have put forward an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, the White House says.
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for another week" as the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election meddling, Trump-Russia relations and the president's potential obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's quarrels for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing wiretaps to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House, and reports of his resignation came through.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was announced, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was speaking on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date has not been set, it could be this week, or a delay of a week considering all other things happening at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press updated".
Some reporters would dispute the claim that Sanders hasn't had a White House press conference since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to anything unpleasant about TV reporters who "play for the gallery", although she said: "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery".
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is holding more question sessions than any president before him", she said, adding, without citing evidence, "We've looked at these numbers".
Conferences will still be held, Sanders said, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and it will replace press conferences, and then you can ask questions directly to the president of the United States".
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances to the press.
Minister for Health writing to EU NHS Scotland staff on Brexit concerns
The Minister for Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express their country's gratitude and wish to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens working in the country's decentralised public sector.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations on the UK's withdrawal from the EU have continued, with decisions expected to come in the autumn.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very troubling time for all of you.
I therefore want to reiterate how much I value the efforts of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and expertise that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here".
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sidelines and just collapsed", Reed said.
Coach and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a stretcher to be taken out for further evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was undergoing surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type/scale of the injury yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before he left the game, which gave him a season total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers are allowed to pay higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, and the extra money is used to help the homeless, according to the Tory party's new plans
The measure will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp duty will apply to non-payers of UK taxes
The UK Treasury Department expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be allowed to pay a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless, as announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's successes in attracting young voters with promises of more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in the stamp duty will be borne by individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will give a boost to the government's commitment to combating homelessness.
The additional levy is added to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on holiday homes and homes purchased for rent, and may be up to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance believes the measure will bring in up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by people living outside the UK, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to gain a foothold in the housing market.
Many well-to-do areas of the country, especially the capital, have become ghost towns because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new release comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty reduction to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping prices high by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to waive quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain's "depressing housing situation".
Jeremy Corbyn has launched a remarkable number of proposals for housing reforms, including a lease and an end to evictions without the tenant's fault.
He also wants to give municipalities more opportunities to build new homes.
Theresa May says: "Last year I said I would devote my time as Prime Minister to reviving the British dream that life would be better for every new generation.
It means solving the problems of the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and also for companies based abroad, to buy housing as it is for hardworking citizens in our country.
The dream of owning a home has become a distant dream for too many people, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to train Scotland".
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to one day become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old shooter looks forward to the challenge of bringing the club from the North East of England to life, which is currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a game in the B team and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But growing up, I watched a lot of Scotland on the Hampden with my dad, and that's always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage to run a club.
Ross's representatives as coach of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin ONeill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he wasn't worried about leaving such established names at such a big club.
"Right now, I'm judging success by the answer to the question 'Can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
This club is definitely a Premier League club, given its structure and talents, he says.
It's not easy getting there, but I think I'd only see myself as successful here if I could get the club back there.
Ross has only been coaching for three years, after a stint as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint as a member of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa get back from relegation to the Third Division, and elevated St Mirren from being close to relegation to winning the Championship the following season.
Ross says he's more satisfied now than ever in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a roadblock", he recalls, referring to when he took command of Alloa.
I really thought leadership was the right thing for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds weird, because I had good results and I could live off it, and I also had some great successes.
But playing can be tough.
There's a lot you have to go through every week.
It's still stress and pressure at work for me, but training feels perfectly right.
I've always wanted to exercise, and I'm doing it now, and I feel better than I've ever felt in my entire adult life.

A survey shows that the perfect time to have a beer is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave has led to increased revenue for the country's struggling pubs, but restaurant chains have come under greater pressure.
Figures showed that pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues declined by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the business consultancy CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "The continued good weather and the fact that England stayed in the World Cup longer than expected meant we saw a similar pattern in July compared to June, when pubs rose by 2.8%.
The decline in restaurant turnover by 1.8 per cent in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars offering mainly drinks performed absolutely best, with figures for the same period last year that had risen more than the restaurants had fallen.
Pubs offering food also had difficulty in the beautiful weather, although not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People just seemed to want to go out for a drink.
The expenditure on pubs and bars increased by 6.6% in the month and food sales by 3%.
Paul Newman, analyst for the service and entertainment industry at RSM, says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting events remain the main factors in the sales of the big cake market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups are still struggling, even though a decline in sales of 4,8% per year is particularly difficult to cope with, in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have been more unpleasant for food-saving businesses, and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we had in August are giving us a much-needed trip.
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new establishments, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
The UK pub and restaurant sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyses the performance of 47 active groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children, sometimes as young as 11, has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school and college students shows an increase in fake Instagram pages
The result has raised concerns that sexual content is being posted there.
20% of students reported having a "main account" they showed their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, creates social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school and middle school students showed a rapid increase in the number of fake Instagram accounts, a reference to the image sharing service Instagram.
The results have raised concerns that sexual content is being posted there.
20% of pupils reported having a clean "main" account that they could show to their parents, and so do private accounts.
A mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old daughter's secret page found a teenager who urged others to rape me.
According to the study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC president Mike Buchanan says: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are lured to create websites where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as an external member of the Board at the Annual General Meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most highly-acclaimed freestyle athlete, and President Ian Beattie describes the election as an outstanding opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh has gained a lot of respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that Scotland's athletes would benefit greatly from her becoming a board member, says Beattie.
Doyle says: "I would love to be a voice for athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, has four Olympic golds in total and is now an expert commentator for the BBC.
He tweeted: "One month ago today, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I've fully recovered, learned to walk again, and now I'm doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!
Advertising for breast pumps comparing mothers to cows sharing the Internet
A breast pump company has caused controversy on the Internet with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be the world's first silent portable breast pump, consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video-inspired commercial with a humorous plot to show the freedom the new pump gives breast milk-pumping moms.
Four real moms dancing in a crowded barn with cows to a song with lyrics like, "Yeah, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail". And "If you didn't know, this isn't a girl, this is a tits".
The refrain continues: "Pump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies".
But the commercial, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has received mixed reactions from viewers, many saying it sheds light on the "phases" of the dairy industry.
A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are taken away only a few days after birth, one person writes.
Elvie breast pump can be carried discreetly in a breastfeeding bag (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "It is understandable that this is traumatic for both mother and child.
But, of course, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?
Another adds: What a reality-free advertising movie. 
Others defend the film, and one woman admits that she finds the song "hysterically funny".
I think this is brilliant.
I would have gotten one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product, someone writes.
Another commented: "This is a funny commercial film that targets mothers who pump (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like "kissing".
This is not a film that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they've all danced with the discreet pump stuck in their stocking.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and can be discreetly worn in a breastfeeding bag, giving women freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go outside while they pump.
Ana Balarin is co-owner and ECD of Mother, and she says, "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women who pump breast milk and milk, we wanted to shed light on breast pumping and the challenges it brings, while showing in an entertaining and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump brings.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk wearing clothes by designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp near the Texas border
The number of deprived migrant children has skyrocketed, although the number of people crossing the border each month is relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with referrals.
In the past, most of the referrals themselves have been undocumented immigrants, afraid to risk their own chances of staying in the country by declaring themselves willing to accept a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult household members would be required to leave fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of individuals who had applied to be referrals for single minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70% of those arrested were previously unknown to law enforcement.
Nearly 80% of persons who are either themselves referrals or family members of referrals are illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
So we're continuing to pursue these individuals", Albence said.
To speed up the handling of children's cases, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their deprivation of liberty, rather than after 60 days, as was previously the practice, according to staff at the camps.
Many of them are present on video rather than in person to bring their legal status case before an immigration judge.
Those not considered to be entitled to protection shall be deported promptly.
The longer children are deprived of their liberty, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempted escape, according to prison staff and reports from the system in recent months.
Proponents say that concerns are growing at larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs of a child's difficulty are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the facility.
They add that if children are moved to the tent city without having enough time to prepare emotionally and to say goodbye to friends, the trauma many already experience can worsen.
Syria demands that the US, French and Turkish occupation forces withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and would be handled accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that the war on terror is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said the Damascus government would continue to fight this holy battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories from both terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who primarily train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the circumstances were good for them to return home, accusing some Western countries of spreading irrational fears that enable refugees to stay away.
'We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return,' he said.
They're politicizing something that should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be given to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops against the province, which has a population of three million.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had clear deadlines and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who will be wiped out.
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the group's work would be limited to the review of the articles of the current constitution, and warned against interference.
Why Donald Trump Will Win a Re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the 2020 re-election unless his presidency ends prematurely through state law and scandal, as many liberal viewers probably hope.
In what would undoubtedly be the most dramatic final of a presidency ever!
At the moment, there's no sign that the audience has grown tired.
Since 2014, the highest-rated viewership numbers have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are almost three times as high, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its peak, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped cable lists with as many as 3.5 million viewers during major news nights.
"This is like a fire that people are drawn to, because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, host of ABC's drama "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell is a longtime comedy writer and has written Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Donald Trump.
Why, then?
He said, "Because he makes me laugh", Nell Scovell tells me.
There's an entertainment value to chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the Washington reporting could determine the future of the abortion case, Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the prosperity of the global economy.
Shutting down is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen to suddenly sit and watch for six hours on an expert panel debating Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" to his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 straw leather jacket (a garment filled with hybrids, as the Washington Post said) and the meaning of Stormy Daniel's macabre descriptions of Donald Trump's, uh, anatomy.
I'm never going to watch Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality show is that he brings something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, "about the Trump administration's rotating cast and daily intrigue (fighting with the NFL, praised Kim Jong-un).
If you miss a single episode, you're gonna end up in the aftermath.
When I spoke to television producer Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny and 27 degrees outside his house on North Kauai in Hawaii, but he was sitting waving inside watching MSNBC while recording a CNN broadcast.
He couldn't wear himself out, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be put before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in the balance.
I remember when we were doing all those crazy programs back in the day and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.

Money from outside flows into the most even race ever for the midterm elections.
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District receives a lot of money thanks to a congressional district restructuring that has now led to two members running for the same seat.
This recently renamed suburban district in Pittsburgh is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is campaigning against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally changed to the Republican advantage.
The race in the new 17th district has caused a campaign funding battle between the major political parties' economic sections, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a widely watched special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats a certain edge.
The United States considered sanctioning El Salvador for aiding China but then backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization leadership team was overthrown by the co-owners.
U.S. State Department officials decided to call home the heads of the U.S. missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including money for drug control and development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have struck a hard blow to the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings continued, U.S. and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively halting considerations of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which is now set to take place in mid-October, a sign of the importance the presidential administration considers the meeting to be, diplomats said.
And the three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations against the promise of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Studying the History
The next inevitable step could be the report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on Donald Trump's alleged abuse in court, which now has tangible evidence in public records.
Mueller is also reportedly directing his investigation into whether Donald Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on the US election.
If Congress were to change the majority, Trump would be held accountable to that assembly just as he prepares to run again in the election, and perhaps finally before a citizens' jury.
There are many uncertain factors involved, and I don't want to say that Trump will inevitably fall.
We all have to face different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, that will affect how far the battle can go.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and stood behind the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such decisive events, and the relentless progress of democracy is either accelerated or slowed.
The Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What are we gonna do if Donald Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what's going to happen in Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed secretly interviewing the president, speculating that he would not be fit for office.
Rosenstein says the Times reporting is not true.
What should we say if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he is admitted to the Supreme Court despite credible sexual assault charges and false testimony?
And most importantly, in the midterm elections, will we vote for a Congress that holds Donald Trump accountable?
If we fail in these tests, democracy faces a dark period.
But I don't think we're gonna fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, she sent me off to light the Sabbath lamp on the table decorated with the hacksaw.
With that as my legacy, how could I be anything but optimistic about the future?
Norman Eisen is a longtime fellow at the Brookings Institution and chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, and author of The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House.
Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna meeting.
The Rangers are hosting Rapid Wien on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians after the impressive Spanish game against Villarreal, which ended in a draw earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season, until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard to bigger successes.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team", says the 31-year-old.
We went into the game thinking we could get something, and we left with a score.
We might have gotten it in the end, but on the whole, it was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came back in the second half and it was a better team.
Now, Thursday is going to be another important night in Europe.
Hopefully, we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game, and they did a good job in their last game, but if we have the audience with us, we can definitely make it up and get a good result.
Last year was really tough, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The troops are good, the guys are having fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put last season behind us and have a good time.
Women sleep poorly because of fear of pension savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the people in the nationwide study said they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the step and talk about it", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for caring for you if you do not talk about how you want to care in time.
Work with your counselor and family and discuss where and how you want to receive care.
Ask your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay for expenses.
Your options for long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term care insurance solution, a hybrid life insurance solution with cash value to cover costs, or self-insurance if you can afford it.
Prepare legal documents: Avoid legal disputes from the outset.
Set up a health authority so that you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that the healthcare staff complies with your wishes if you become unable to communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to afford them.
Remember the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who is in an emergency medical condition and on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down such details so you're ready.
"It's not just the economy that's at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What medicines are these?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure you have the plan ready.
Several air guns fired at Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with a shotgun while walking home from a night out.
The victim, who is in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police describe the shooting, which occurred at about 2:30 a.m., as a "single incident".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are urging witnesses to hear from them.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Communications are down, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to get any information from the Donggala Management Area, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, and is located in a dense bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. The city's population was estimated at 379,800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is an administrative area extending over more than 300 km off the north-western Sulawesi coast.
The administrative region, which is an administrative region under a province, had a population estimated at 299 200 in 2017.
The economic pillars of Central Sulawesi are fishing and agriculture, particularly in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also significant in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past hundred years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Authority.
In 1938, a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala killed more than 200 people.
Also in 1996, the western Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is in the Circum-Pacific seismic ring of fire, which is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the most devastating earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries. 226,000 people died along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A major earthquake struck the administrative district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings collapsing.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for filing a domestic violence complaint and for resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su detention and is being held on $500 bail if the suspect violates bail terms, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday and pleaded not guilty when asked to resign, according to the television station.
Palin is charged with three counts of Class A misdemeanor, which carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now being handled by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, involvement in the reporting of domestic violence and possession of a firearm while under the influence in connection with that incident.
His girlfriend accuses him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder, which stems from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake, measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Power and communications are down, and deaths are expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Films showing when it hit are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare death sentence that hasn't been carried out for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck from the Home Depot construction and interior department to carry out an attack on a cycleway along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, hauling down pedestrians and cyclists in his path during the attack, which took place in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, according to the death penalty statement filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges could carry a death sentence, according to the court filing.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was indicted by a federal jury on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in support of protective activities, which are often used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as abuse and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required extensive planning and intent, prosecutors said, while describing the way Saipov carried it out as "abominable, cruel and inhuman".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused damage and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, the statement of intent states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York hasn't sued in a case that's been seeking the death penalty for a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal court sentenced him to death in New York was in 1953, when married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were both executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who is a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag flown on his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "exclusively disappointed" in the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept life imprisonment without the possibility of parole if the accused pleads guilty only prolongs the trauma these events have caused to all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's team of defendants had earlier asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be given responsibility for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to mobilize the People's Army today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must recognize the heat of EU skeptics when one of Theresa May's own MPs proposed that he lead the EU negotiations.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that Britain would have already gone away if Nigel Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge of bringing deeply divided supporters together has been exacerbated by EU-positive tory members joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers Agreement, alive under attack from Brexit supporters, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her allies have insisted that she should press and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback, and force EU skeptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and chaos.
Bone said at a mass meeting organised by Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "spole the Chequers agreement".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been at the wheel, we would have been out by now", he said.
Peter Bone, representing the Wellingborough constituency in Parliament, added: 'I will stand for Brexit, but we must scrap the Chequers agreement'.
He made his opposition to the EU clear and said: 'We have not fought world wars to become subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone dismissed the claims that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British would have changed and now want to stay is completely untrue".
The Brexit supporter, Andrea Jenkins of the Tory Party, was also present at the march and spoke to the journalists.
The Chequers deal is unpopular with the public, the opposition won't vote for it, it's unpopular with the party and our election workers who are out on the streets and making sure we get elected.
Put the Chequers deal away and start listening.
And she added a sharp message to Theresa May: "Prime Ministers must keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians must be given a warm welcome if they are to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is about trust between us, the people, and the political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them: We're not going to let you get away with it.
He added to the enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to make our political class, which is close to betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass rally in the city centre.
A group of activists waved banners with the text "Torymembers against Brexit" after the group launched this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis of the House of Commons mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
It is these people who say they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus the plus-plus agreement, for frictionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland, he added.
It's a clean father.
There is no good Brexit, he added.
Warren is planning a "regular thinker" to run for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to make a "decent decision" about running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a city council meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticized President Donald Trump, and is now running for re-election in November against Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was vice chairman of Donald Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She's been the subject of speculation that she might run for President Donald Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th city hall meeting with voters since Donald Trump took office.
Someone asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government.
A person arrested for the shooting death of basketball player Sims from LSU
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 a.m. ET.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man seen in the photos.
20-year-old Sims was shot to death near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died from it", Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via 247 sports.
Wayde went in between to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene and to having a weapon, and he admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge police station.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm tall and raised in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaching the World Championship after team orders gave him a win over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' team orders would play a big role in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start and nearly hung Hamilton out on dry as he defended his position during the first two laps, inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the depot first and let Hamilton drive into the back of the pack, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes entered the depot a turn later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after a little wheel-to-wheel action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free at the risk of bidding on the spot after a double-header to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and was down seven at the end of the first wharf on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and held onto the tires to reach a quick finish and run over Kimi Raikkonen to become fourth.
He finally arrived at the depot at the 44th yard but failed to raise the pace during the remaining eight yards when Raikkonen climbed to fourth place.
It's a hard day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job and got a first and a second, Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a mass rally on Saturday, for insisting she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to be a Supreme Court justice, was accused of sexual assault.
The president, speaking at a mass rally in West Virginia, did not directly take up Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were rude, rude and lying.
"The only thing that could happen and the nice thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry, mean, ugly and lying", he said.
You see press releases and leaks and they say, "No, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Have you leaked it, Dianne Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? Did you leak the document?
Oh, no, I'm not.
I haven't leaked it.
Wait a minute now.
"Have we leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything", he added, imitating the senator.
The letter detailing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied the leak had come from her office.
"I have not obscured Ford's allegations, I have not leaked her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she wanted.
But her dementia didn't seem to fit the president, who, during the Saturday night meeting, commented, "I'll tell you one thing.
She may not have, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The President continues to support the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual offences by three women, and he hinted that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see their wickedness and their disgust, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, the president said, according to the digital news website Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars won their Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the return game 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Belfast Giants got an early two-point lead from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were home team receipts before Dwyer reinstated the Belfast Giants.
Francois Bouchard was credited for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's side, who came from behind and beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for the two teams, and the Belfast Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyers' opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave an assist when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the intense first period, Sullivan brought home the game back to the field at 1:10 p.m. before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie who received a receipt at 5:16 p.m.
Dwyer made sure the Belfast Giants were in the lead at the first break when he scored his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again conceded with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, and he secured the win with his team's fifth halfway through the final period.
The Belfast Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play Milton Keynes at home in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died so that hundreds of people on a plane could escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is now being hailed as a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing since a major earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are stuck in the hustle and bustle of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly sloping control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian television channel ABC News.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
We are devastated to hear this, he added.
At the same time, authorities fear the death toll could rise to over 1,000, and the country's disaster relief authority says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is believed to continue to rise as many bodies remain in the ruins, and many have not been reached", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves up to six metres high have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are flying in aid and supplies.
35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with dead bodies.
It's bad for clean water.
Minimum markets are looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help survivors, but we don't know what they will encounter there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports a man missing after plane crashed in a lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean state that one man is missing, having previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were evacuated from the sinking plane and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about further details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Islands airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and were in stable condition.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and what the course of events looked like.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both reported that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses believed the plane was slipping past the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was boarding very low.
"It's extremely good", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through deep water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the cabin crew panicked and screamed, and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to develop a shipyard also assisted in the rescue work by using a blasting boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank in the 30 meter [30 m] deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw a timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution closed its second trial on Saturday against a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone lists to puzzle out the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his earlier claims, reported the news magazine The Clarion Ledger.
When the records showed that his cell phone was with Chambers' cell phone during the time period he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying", because my truck was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone lists showed they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final address on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be submitted to the jury later that day.
What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes that hip-hop has come a long way from its origins in political messages and attacking social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently been given a boost in the UK by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
A black one again?
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing after a racist text message
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory termination after receiving an erroneous text message from her mother, who complained that she was "just black again".
The couple denies they were racist and compared the lawsuit to blackmail.
Twins mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed horror when she realized that the new baby girl Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"No answer at all", Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman turned to her, fired Maurice, and claimed that their former niece, who was African American, had done a bad job and that she instead expected a Filipino woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent home in a taxi.
Now she's suing the couple to get compensation for the dismissal, asking for compensation in the order of $350 a day for the job she was originally hired to do, which was to be for six months and where she would live with the couple, but she had no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that", she told the New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination.
The couple rejected the accusations of being racist and said the only way to stop Giselle was to terminate her employment, worried that they would not be able to trust her after they had insulted her.
My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists, " said husband Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
But would you entrust your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously, I'm not.
Plasco compared the lawsuit to blackmail and said his wife would give birth two months later and was in a very difficult situation.
Should you give up on someone like that?
This is not particularly pleasant, added investment banker Plasco.
The legal process is still ongoing, but public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington publishers didn't think readers could relate to a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Paddington author Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was adopted, commented on the letter: "It is difficult to imagine what it was like for a person who first read it before it was published.
It's very funny, given what we now know about Paddington's great success.
She told that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family", adding that her father was proud in silence of his ultimate success.
"He was quite quiet, and not a boastful person", she said.
But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who's doing something, and you're proud of the child even if you're not the one who's done it.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to give Paddington himself the honor.
My daughter was going to die, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that she was not expected to make it", said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad that said she was gonna die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my darling.
I'll be right with you.
I'll come to you.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly eased out and left her body.
She had died just before, and now everything was turned off.
I just had to sit there and wait and know that all this was happening.
I could not clap or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get myself together.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew about it", she said.
I bowed my head, and tears came out all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Women mourning put up postcards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up a card on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers to call for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and took his own life at 18.
"I don't want any parent to have to feel as bad as I do every day", she says.
Sharon Davis, 45, lives in Lydney, and she tells us that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile lit up the room.
But he stopped working before he died, because he was in a very dark place.
Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother when he committed suicide in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I'm always worried about consequences".
Sharon Davis created the cards so people would know that there are people to go out and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still, talk about it.
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, some time after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was depressed or depressed or anything", she says.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he was behaving differently.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom, and when the kids opened their Christmas presents, he had no eye contact with them or anything.
She says his death was a very hard blow for them, but they have to get through it.
It's going to break us.
But we all have to keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
'I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for - an investigation limited in time and scope - we might have some agreement,' said Jeff Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be split up by deep-rooted differences between the parties.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their reluctance depends entirely on the timing.
The midterm elections are due in just five weeks, on November 6th, and if the Republicans make a bad election, as expected, they will be severely weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone and called the senators to persuade them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was George W. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
There's going to be a vote in the Senate, which now has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Kavanaugh can win at least 50 Senate votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and confirm his nomination to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean hoppers who are junking under Kim
The number of North Koreans who jump to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, says that 1 127 people jumped last year, compared with 2 706 in 2011.
Park says tougher border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs on human traffickers are important reasons.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean hopefuls are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees the refugees as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war with each other, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the stalled nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work for the Korean Peninsula to become nuclear-free.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of success since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we absolutely cannot disarm ourselves unilaterally first", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", and says he's unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosis' comments came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had acted like this, she would be called hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the allegations of sexually assaulting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was emotionally moved, and from time to time he almost screamed and his voice stopped talking about his family and his high school years.
He also expressly condemned the Democrats on the committee, saying the charges against him were a "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" that was organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi was hesitant when asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to federal court if he were elected, and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this. If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he's on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about what decisions Kavanaugh might make against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion case Roe v. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not the time for a hysterical and partisan person to sit in court and expect us all to applaud, Pelosi said.
Women have to stand.
It's a just criticism, months and years of anger boiling over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's unusual, do you?
And she went on to say, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was CEO somewhere, and she said that she cried when she got angry, too, but she had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you.
And then she went on.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are allowed to flow out of anger in part because they are often misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I once cried out of indescribable anger, was that I was taken in the collar by an older woman, a cold boss I had always been a little afraid of, and she pulled me into a staircase.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy that they managed to push you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught up in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason not to examine the idea of running for president himself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because she was late, she was late with the fundraiser, and she promised not to run for office unless she got $2 million.
It was a project doomed to failure.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave 1,000 dollars to men only gave her 250 dollars.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she announced in a speech that she would not launch a formal presidential campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism, that the voice stalled.
"You could have thought I had a nervous breakdown", recalls Schröder about the press' reaction.
You could have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my gravestone?
She was crying?
Why the US-China Trade War Could Be Good for Beijing
The opening stages of the US-China trade war were deafening, and the war is far from over, but experts say the gap between the two countries could benefit the Chinese government in the long run.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by placing tariffs on key Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase came this week, with new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, which means that practically half of all goods entering the United States from China are subject to customs.
Beijing has responded with the same coin every time, and recently, tariffs of between five and 10 percent on US goods worth $60 billion were imposed.
China has promised to match the US's actions, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to decline any time soon.
To get Washington back means to bow to demands, but to publicly crawle for the United States would be far too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its shortcomings, the press from the US trade war could provide positive support to China in the long run by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"A rapid political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic panic in either country, and it is actually far more dangerous than observers have previously been willing to admit", says Abigail Grace, research assistant with Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria ready for returning refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready to accept returning refugees and is pleading for help to rebuild the country, which is in ruins after more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were now improving.
"The situation on the ground today is more stable and secure, thanks to our successes in fighting terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that it does not accept conditional support or assistance from countries that have supported the rebellion.
Europe withdrew with the victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA in the final 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight European matches and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard for most of the tournament, fell into the water at the 16th hole pair 3 track, losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all rounds and became one of four players to ever score 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten out 5 & 4 by the lowest ranked player of the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cups behind him, became the tournament's most successful European ever with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win back the victory.
It is about the team, and I am glad I could help.
He handed over the staff to his compatriot John Ram who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
"What an incredible pride to beat Tiger Woods.
Woods lost all four of his games in France, and now has a record of 13-21-3 for his Ryder Cup career.
A curious statistic for one of the world's greatest players ever, who has won 14 major titles, only to be surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the fairway, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-end golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk, the American captain, said after the team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
It was this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the bait.
- The hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna work with the PGA Tour of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we're moving on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You can bend and bend.
They played better than us.
Algae flowering: decreasing levels in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in algal bloom concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Commission, uneven flowering is reported in the areas around the municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which may indicate decreased levels.
The seaweed flowering stretches over 20 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
The stains can be seen about a mile and a half out into the sea outside the city of Hillsborough, but in fewer places than last week.
Algae blooms have also been observed in the municipality of Pasco.
Medium concentrations in or off the coast of Pinellas have been reported over the past week: off the coast of Hillsborough low to high concentrations, background concentrations high to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations high to high concentrations in or off the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations low to medium concentrations in or off the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from the major cities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwest Florida last week.
