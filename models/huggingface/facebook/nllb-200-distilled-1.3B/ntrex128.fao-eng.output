Welsh MPs worried about the distribution
Some MPs are divided by the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This has arisen because there are plans to change the name of the parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of Congress in the political system worry that it can make money off of them.
A member of the Labour Party indicated that his group was afraid of the rhyme Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means share and pwp means nonsense.
A member of Parliament from Plaid said the group was completely dissatisfied and had looked at other options.
One Conservative Party member said his group was "unprejudiced" about the name change, but noted that it was a short political race from the MWP to the Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The language committee that is now drafting the bill to implement the name change has stated the following: "The final decision on words to describe the parliament is of course made by the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June the committee announced the results of a general consultation on the Bill, which stated that the majority was for the nomination of the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the elected Members of Parliament, the committee was the Welsh Parliament Members or WMP, but the MWP electorate was best supported in a general election.
Lawmakers have apparently explored other options, but the struggle to reach an agreement may be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who is expected to present a legislative proposal on the changes within weeks.
The law on the reform will also include other changes to the way the Parliament works, a new set of rules regarding the conduct of parliamentarians and the deliberation of the committee.
The Senate has the final say on what to say when discussing the bill.
Macedonians go to a referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday whether the country's name should be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia.
A very popular election was held to clarify the extent of the dispute with the Greek neighbors, who have a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that the name of its northern neighbours represents a claim to its territory, and has repeatedly made offers for EU and NATO membership.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum, has said he will not attend the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is necessary for EU and NATO membership.
The bells of St. Martin's this bell rings as churches in Harlem fight
"Historically, the old people I spoke to said that there was a bar and a church on every corner", Mr. Adams said.
Today there is none.
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People don't socialize the same way today", he said.
The children are no longer standing in the neighborhood where people go regularly.
He is disturbing the churches by selling them money and not keeping them as long as the leaders expect, sooner or later they will be back where they started.
Churches, he added, can be replaced by private houses with parish governors, full of people who are not willing to help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"Unfortunately, most people who buy houses in these buildings will become white", he said, "and therefore will hurry under the sun when these churches are stoned with all, because it is unlikely that more than half of these people who move into these houses are part of the churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin's ten years later.
The original, white, methodical congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A crowd of Jews had gathered nearby and surrounded the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Lord John Howard Johnson, who had a ban on shopping on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, which opposed hiring or working for black people.
After a fire in 1939, the building was badly damaged, but as the people in Father Johnson's estate made plans to rebuild, they installed the clock tower.
Sir David Johnson, son of Johnson's father and successor to St. Martin's, called the earliest clock the "Poor Man's Clock".
The expert who played the bell in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an unforgettable, historical sound".
The expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin's in recent months has been a complex history of architects and builders, some praised by leaders of the church, others by the diocese.
The Council of the Church - the governing body of the investigation, made by the leaders of the Church - wrote to the diocese in July with the complaint that the court wanted to pass the costs onto the Council of the Church, although the Council had not been involved in hiring the architects and architects that the diocese had sent in.
Some in the audience complained about the lack of transparency from the bishopric.
Hovur is 13 years old on a lobster hunt in California.
A 13-year-old boy was hit and freed Saturday while hunting lobster in California on the first day of lobster season, officials reported.
The accident occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been chatting with friends for about a half hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then went with a group to rescue him from the water.
Hammel said that he initially thought it was the thrill of catching a lobster, but soon realized he was screaming, "I'm bitten!"
I'm bitten by it!
The cheese was upset, so Hammel saw him as he went over to the boy.
And I cried to all the people, that they should come up out of the water: there is a hail in the water. And Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is listed in a coma.
The type of haemorrhage responsible for the accident was unknown.
Chief lifeguard Larry Giles had said at a press conference that a whale had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not thought to be a problematic species of whale.
Giles added that the solution would have been to damage the bulb.
Officials closed the access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigative and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are about 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not endangered.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the beauty market in the UK.
Sainsbury's offers Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with warehouse-like beauty salons staffed by dedicated helpers.
As part of a major move into the UK's $2.8 billion beauty market, which is steadily growing as fashion and accessories sales fall, larger beauty walks will be trialled in 11 stores across the country and implemented over the next several years if it is well received.
The investment in beauty comes from department stores looking for ways to fill the shelves, which were once filled with monitors, microwaves and furniture.
Sainsbury's has said it will double its range of beauty products to 3,000, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The selection of products already available, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, also gains more space with brands similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket will once again feature a boutique range of make-up, with most products becoming vegan-friendly - something that is being fully appealed to by younger customers.
Following this, the fragrance retailer, the Fragrance Shop, will be testing special offers in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening in Croydon, South London, last week, while the other will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a change to buying small portions of food daily in neighboring stores mean that supermarkets must do more to attract visitors.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that stores will generally become more like department stores as supermarkets try to compete with discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has added Argos stores to hundreds of retail locations, and has also introduced several Habitat stores, following the purchase of both chains two years ago, which is said to have supported retail sales and made the acquisition even more profitable.
The supermarket's first attempt to take over the grocery and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's attempted to partner with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over how to divide the revenue from the stores' pharmacies.
The new plan follows Sainsbury's' sale of its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds was said to be interested in playing its part in the scheme with an expanded range of luxury leather goods, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the general manager of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also put in place a professional team of trained workers who are ready to help.
Our range of brands is tailored to suit everyone, and the enticing environment and convenient location enable us to be a true beauty item that offers an old-fashioned shopping experience.
Peter Jones in anger after Holly Willoughby withdraws from a £11 million deal.
The star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is in a state of shock after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to settle his new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their dress and their badge, Truly.
The pair's acting was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was stepping down.
Holly Willoughby has made the star of Dragons' Den, Peter Jones, fall apart by retiring from the lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute - to cash in on her new, unusually lucrative deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was already in a rage when the TV star, at a heated meeting on Tuesday, at the headquarters of the Marlow shopping centre in Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new contracts - worth up to £1.5m - meant she no longer had time to invest in their beauty and lotion shop, Truly.
The brand was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop, and was thought to double Willoughby's £11 million estate.
When Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones from the UK fled to one of her summer homes.
One source has said: "Truly was Holly's highest ranking.
It was going to be her long-term future, which would carry her through the next decade.
Her decision to leave was a shock to all those around her.
No one understands what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to being over.
The headquarters in Marlow has a full layer of goods ready to sell.
Experts believe the departure of This Morning, one of the UK's most trusted stars, could cost the company millions due to heavy investment in products ranging from codes and lighting to clothing and accessories, as well as potential delays before it is completed.
And it may bring an end to an old friendship.
The mother of three, Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been dating Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, took over as chairman in March.
The couple travels together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby becomes the brand ambassador for M&S and saves Ant McPartlin from hosting the show, I'm A Celebrity, on ITV.
A friend of Jones' said last night, "We have no business with him".
Hard to believe, but we fell in love
He was concerned about the reactions he would receive for making comments that some consider to be overly prescient and for being so critical of the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his arguably most recent speech.
I have not given up anything.
He added that Kim was interested in meeting again after their first meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as a major step toward a nuclear-free North Korea.
However, talks on nuclear disarmament have been suspended.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see any "corresponding reaction" from the United States to North Korea's disarmament initiative.
Instead, he added, he is bringing the United States forward with punitive measures to keep pressure on.
Trump had a more optimistic view in his speech.
"It's going well with North Korea", he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Several million people had died.
Now we have this good relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had been successful - ending missile tests, rescuing hostages, and bringing American troops home.
And he was unusually vocal about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to fit into this crowded room, about 200 are standing right there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate island, hundreds more dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign aid organizations learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was evacuated, it was not declared a national disaster, a prerequisite for triggering international aid.
In many cases, however, they have been very determined that they do not need global support, so it is a bit challenging", Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is not certain that foreign workers will be allowed to work there.
Mr. Sutopo, a national disaster spokesman, said that Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would be allowed to contribute.
Indonesia's recurring earthquakes make the country still unfortunately unprepared for the ravages of nature.
While tsunami waves are common in Aceh, they are not common on other beaches.
It is likely that the tsunami warning bells in Pali, despite being warned, have caused significant human deaths.
In the best of times, travel between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters make transportation even more complex.
A hospital ship from Lombok to treat victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the great disaster.
President Joko Widodo made the transformation of the tailored infrastructure a major issue in his campaign, and he has spent money on roads and rail bridges.
However, winning rivalry has plagued the government of Lord Joko, who is now up for re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were displaced, while Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets with masks, bows and arrows and other crude weapons.

Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea, with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was sent off by Xherdan Shaqiri 30 yards from Chelsea when the score was 1-0.
He moved the ball to his left before shooting at the wrist.
The attempt sailed high above the breach by a bow directly towards the right corner of the net.
The ball slowed to end up on a loose Kepa Arrizabalaga and into the net.
"I was just trying to get in the right position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward when possible, so I was just trying to create the best time possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming and moved the ball, didn't think much about it and just tried a shot.
Chelsea were leading 1-0 in the second half after a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue's defender passed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before he snapped and went full speed into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic made a quick one-two in the middle.
He then hit a beautiful runner-up ball that led Hazard into the break.
Hazard ran from the defence and shot into the left-footed hand side net in front of Liverpool's Alisson Becker.

The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency reported early Sunday.
Several people were said to be trapped in rubble from collapsed buildings as a result of the 7.5 on the Richter scale quake that struck on Friday and caused damage of up to 20 feet, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Pau, with a population of over 380,000, was destroyed by the collapse of the buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after stabbing woman to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with knife wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to report anything they see or hear.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just beginning, but I would like to make an appeal to anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything malicious to turn to us.
Also, a request to anyone, especially the carrier, who may have received something from the first time, to turn to us, because they can have information that is very important for our investigation.
A police spokesman has speculated that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and that she was found inside a fire.
Later, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the village to ask where she had been found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing and police say they are in the process of passing on the information to the victim's family.
A tow truck driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to break into his apartment, but is stopped by police for not allowing anyone in or out of the building.
He was speechless.
Now the inhabitants will know that it will be hours before they get back in.
A policeman was heard to say to a man that the whole area was now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to him, weeping and mourning.
She keeps repeating, "It's so awful".
At 2 p.m., two police cars were inside the building and another just outside.
A large number of policemen were stationed outside the courtyard, guarding the residential blocks.
Anyone with information is invited to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers by e-mail at 0800 555 111 and refer to file 247 dated September 30.
The statue of Cromwell's Parliament is the last monument to the history of the line
The declaration would have been a stern justice for his Taliban as well as the destruction of so many English cultural and religious assets by his far-right, puritan followers.
However, the Cromwellian Society described Lord Crick's proposal as "a change of pace" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is not to be escaped in the present chaos of statuary suppression that the creation of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster should become a matter of course.
The moral opposition to the English Civil Wars was neither contained nor extinguished by Cromwell.
Possibly the crooked Cromwell was sacrificed to his ancestor, Thomas, in the last century.
The liberal legacy of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a testament to nineteenth-century thought and the history of a man who many still consider worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph that: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than today, as a defender of Parliament against outside pressure, in his case the monarchy, of course.
Whether there is a purely detailed explanation is still a matter of debate in the historical record.
One thing is certain, and that is that the war in the mid-seventeenth century created a succession of civilizations of our country, and Cromwell is a unique and recognizable figure who represents the other side.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance.
Chinese Farmer Deadly Injured by Serial Killer Pig
A farmer was beaten and killed by a pig in a field in the Appearance area, according to local media.
The man, known by his last name Yuan, was found dead with a worn body, covered in blood near a street in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to spray chicken pox into pigs on a pig farm May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
It is said that he had traveled with his nephew from the neighboring province, Yunnan, on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next day, the brother's son was found dead and found the door of the house open.
He told me that the pigs were covered in blood.
A court investigation concluded that the 550-pound pig had injured the farmer to death, according to the report.
The nephew's legs were bloodied, the nephew, nicknamed Wu, said, the Guiyang Evening News reported.
Security footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
About an hour later, her body was found.
The beast that killed the man had neither Yuan nor the nephew.
A market leader told the Evening News that the pig was hidden away to prevent it from running off to anyone else while police were collecting test cases at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities conspired to avenge his death.
Although the hands themselves, examples of pigs leaning on humans have been seen before.
In 2016, a pig ran over a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the husband with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had held a Welsh farmer by his tractor until his wife came and scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually good for you, but the taste of blood can be a good sign.
They're just plain old boys.
They're ignorant, they're very curious... they're not after you.
"You just play them in front of the crowd out of respect", he said.
The descent of the Pink Odin will come with a rain of cruelty over the sight of the United States
Legend has it that the Pink Owl swells as it moves over colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
Soon, Rosa will bring a flood of rain over northern Mexico and the United States in the coming days.
Winds on Rosa were 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, at 5 a.m. on Sunday, and were centered at 385 mph in a view from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure system begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, as a tropical storm, it will push deep, tropical moisture northward into the landscape of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture and the forthcoming low pressure winds will create a widespread rainfall in a spectacular manner in the coming days.
1 to 4 inches of rain in places, will result in river flooding, sewage flows and possible desert runoff.
Deep, tropical moisture flows to a rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour in places, especially in areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in places of the view, especially over a large portion of Arizona.
Floods can occur and quickly get worse because of the lightning bolt of tropical rain.
It is advised not to venture out into the desert for walking for fear of tropical rain.
The impact can turn a yeast into a severe hail and a drought into a river in places and dust winds.
The approaching low pressure wind brings heavy rainfall to areas along the coast of Southern California.
Collected rainfall amounts of more than half an inch are possible, which can lead to less dust winds and steep roads.
This will be the first rain in the country this wet season.
Some light tropical rainfall is expected to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before rains become more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
The crash will continue until Four Corners Tuesday, lasting all day Wednesday.
In October, there could be major temperature changes across the United States, as the Arctic gets colder while the tropical belt is still extremely hot.
It can sometimes cause severe temperature changes over short periods.
One such example of temperature changes is in Central America on Sunday.
There are more than 20 degrees of difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will try to build up and grow again.
Many places in Central and Eastern America are expected to experience a hot start in October, with temperatures reaching as high as 80 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the continental divide.
In New York City, temperatures can reach 80 degrees on Tuesdays, 10 degrees above average.
The long-term study shows the outlook for above-average temperatures throughout the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the trial of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched the wedding day of the sensational Supreme Court testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, allegedly in the late 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different television networks.
Meanwhile, the political standoff continued as embassies disturbed the regular schedule on Friday in the most unexpected last-minute move: an agreement reached with Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she had no doubt that Kavanaugh had drunk her and tried to drop her off at a student conference.
Kavanaugh, in a fiery testimony, said he had no doubt that it did not happen.
It's true that more than 20.4 million people, Nielsen said on Friday, saw it.
The company reported average earnings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not directly shared by other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking at offices.
To put it in perspective, there's a crowd that's similar to her watching a football game at the end of the season or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts supported Kavanaugh's nomination, was the most watched network, with an average of 5.69 million viewers, during the day-long trial, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had $3.1 million, NBC $2.94 million, MSNBC $2.89 million and CNN $2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The desire for justice continued.
Flake was the main character in the exciting event on Friday.
After the moderate Republican administration announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was seen by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as protesters shouted at him as he tried to get into an elevator to a court hearing.
He didn't look up, while he was found for several minutes being brutally, live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", a woman had said.
Do you think he speaks the truth for the country?
"You have a right to be strong, " someone said to him". Many women are weak.
Flake said that his administration had announced before the elevator stopped that he had more to say to the committee hearing.
The broadcasts were broadcast live hours later as the judiciary was about to vote to move Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if he knew the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee by next week, a move that Democrats have called a "memorial".
Flake was for a time convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and several senators later, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election was a resounding victory, as it was clear that Republicans did not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the poll.
President Trump has begun an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May accuses voters of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused opposition to her plan to leave the European Union of playing politics with Britain's future, and of wasting national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, on her front page page, her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, stressed her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs from each other was "completely absurd".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Dyteon Simpson is arrested by police on suspicion of the death of an LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU curveball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with involuntary manslaughter, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officers released footage of the collision between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting and killing Wayde.
Bail is set at $350,000, the prosecution said.
The East Baton Rouge Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, stating the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and into the neck.
The department is honoring the Louisiana State Police fugitive, the State Police Crime Investigation Unit, Southern University Police and local residents for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked local police for their "accountability and commitment to justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-2 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played curveball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU curling coach Will Wade said the team was "forgotten and shaken" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time", Wade said.
Volcanoes erupting in Mexico City
The eruption of ash from the Popocatepetl volcano is overnight in the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Emergency declared a state of emergency on Saturday, warning Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity began in the basin and 183 gas and ash discharges were recorded in 24 hours.
There were thunder and heavy earthquakes in the city.
Social media images of thinly veiled Austrian police posing on the front of cars in a neighborhood in Mexico City, now Xochimilco.
Geologists have detected an increase in activity in the volcano, located 45 miles (72 km) inland from the capital, after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
The police break up with liberated Catalans, before the anniversary of the referendum.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after pro-liberation protesters broke with the anti-drug police, and thousands of people marched in the racecourse to mark the first anniversary of the clumsy referendum on liberation.
A group of masked liberators, held back by the lawless police, lit eggs and powdered powder after them, waiting for the dark dust shade in the streets, which were usually full of travelers.
Fighting also broke out later in the day, forcing the police to use their batons to stop the fighting.
For hours, groups of liberators sang "Forget not, do not forgive" to the cries of the commoners.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries from the riot, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the liberal party a year after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by liberation-minded Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although participation was low, as opponents of independence generally boycotted the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were displaced last year after police, in violent clashes, tried to stop the election at polling stations across the country.
Bands of loose-livered men had camped the night before Friday to prevent a riot against the police.
The opposing party eventually succeeded, but had to go another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who was opposed to the liberation movement with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about the prospects for Catalonia's independence.
Last year we had one of the best times.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they didn't get to vote, but now we're fasting", he said.
Despite a small victory in the December general election, Catalan liberation parties have been reluctant to maintain their performance this year, with many of their leaders in self-imposed exile or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent threat of self-rule.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, said the collapse was publicized by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting worse", he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since late last year, Oriol Junqueras, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"Being a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the decline in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
But arrested for running over a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car hit a house in Londonderry.
The scene took place in Ballynagard Crescent on the wedding day at around 19:30 BST.
The cryptographer, Bob Blemming, said that there were damage to the doors and the houses themselves.
A loaded bow may have been fired at the car.
A lot of shots gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
The Livingston upset Rangers to give Steven Gerrard his only loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox side.
Dolly Menga's goal proved to be the difference, as Gary Holt's team moved up to second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side have yet to win a Premiership title this season and will face Hearts, who are eight points behind, on Sunday.
Before that, Rangers face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League final.
Livingston, on the other hand, increases his undefeated streak in the league to six games, and head coach Holt is still missing a losing effort after taking over from Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston abuses opportunities against uninvited guests
Holt's side should have been ahead long before they scored, as their fitness created major problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson came through but sent the ball in forwards and Alan Lithgow could only manage the ball in front of goal, having slipped in to face Craig Halkett's scorer in the back.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers have the ball, as they knew they could cause problems for the visitors in the pitch.
And so the decisive case came to pass.
Rangers scored a free kick and Livingston found a hole, and after a match between Declan Gallagher and Robinson, Menga made a move and scored from the break.
Rangers had control of the ball throughout the match, but were unable to break through the tight defence and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to do.
The score continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly out in a save.
Scott Pittman was dismissed with the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow bounced forward from another dead-ball position at Livingston.
Innings continued to come into the Livingston break and were continually ruled out, while two claims for a break kick - one after a tackle by Halkett on substitute Glenn Middleton, and the other for a hand on the ball - were ruled out.
Excellence of Livingston - article
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
An outstanding achievement and achievement by Livingston.
They were all, as one, free, and kept going hoping for the upward trajectory.
Their style and manhood are virtually unchanged since their return to the top flight, but Holt deserves much credit for the team's innovation since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
The team captain, Halkett, was strong enough to manage a well-organized defense, while Menga called Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall out of the entire match.
The Rangers, however, didn't have much to offer.
As good as they have been at times with Gerrard as coach, they disappointed well and respectfully today.
The final delivery was lacking - they only managed to outplay the opposition once - and it is a serious warning for Rangers, who are in the middle of the division.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There were clear and blue clouds on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - intended to improve relations between NATO countries.
There has been a lot of talk about human rights, freedom of the press and the Turkish membership of the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to inaugurate a large, new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police announced that security was the reason why a crowd of 25,000 was prevented from gathering in front of the mosque, but many fans gathered nearby to see their president.
Several hundred anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - were heard condemning Erdogan's policies, including the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The objections highlighted the clash between some German Turks who welcome a guest while others feel strongly about the same guest as a monarch.
Deptford collision: Sugar man killed in collision with a bee
A candy bar owner is killed in a car crash in London
The collision occurred near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in an out-of-town area, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped, and the man was brought in, but he died on the spot.
The collision comes just months after another cyclist was killed by a speeding driver on Childers Street, about a mile from the crash on Saturday.
The police in the capital have ordered police to work to find the man's identity and release his family.
Road belts and bus lanes are in place and motorists are being asked to leave the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers shot in riot
Six guards have been released in a riot at a high security prison, the prison administration announced.
The disaster started at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09.30 on Sunday morning and is still ongoing.
Especially Tornado police officers are called in to investigate the riot, which involves eight inmates and is in only one ward.
The police were first treated with small loose faces on the spot.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "Really bad prison guards are being used to understand the incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six workers have been treated for their injuries.
We are not harsh in our imprisonment and we are determined that those responsible are handed over to the police and can therefore be imprisoned for a longer time.
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most troubled criminals.
In June, it was announced that the warden was being treated in hospital after being beaten by a prisoner.
And last October, law enforcement was called to the prison to investigate a serious riot in which workers were beaten with pole shots.
The Rose of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened with flooding
It is natural that a tropical depression will hit Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen early next week when Tropical Storm Rosa turns its remaining force over the Desert Southwest, creating a risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona into southern and eastern Nevada, the states of California and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and as she approaches late spring it will rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones have been designated tropical storms or low-pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm within 40 miles of the AZ mark.
Recent National Hurricane Center estimates forecast 2 to 4 inches of rain, in places up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the Desert Southwest, one now in the middle of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin can expect 1 to 2 inches, possibly up to 4 inches in places.
For those outside the floodplain, the rain of Rose may be a blessing, as the land is affected by turquoise.
Although flooding is a serious issue, some of the rainfall is expected to be beneficial, as it is so dry in the Southwest at the moment.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, the second highest rate, weather.com reports.
The first landfall of the Rose River is across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still at low sunrise with a speed of 85 mph, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 mph.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and the tide recedes gradually.
Therefore, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico with the force of a tropical storm late Monday or evening.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico is likely to be heavy, resulting in significant flooding.
Rainfall of up to 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California into the outskirts of Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible in some areas, weather.com reports.
Rosa then moved northward over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical depression, then moving north through Arizona and into the healthier part of Utah late Tuesday.
The most likely storm of the Rosa or its tributaries is heavy rainfall in Baja California, the Sonoran Desert and the U.S. Southwest, the National Hurricane Center reported.
This rain is expected to produce life-threatening rivers and streams in the deserts, as well as mountain gorges.
Midsomer Norton raid: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found unresponsive in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 04:00 BST on Sunday morning.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Police have called on anyone who may have a recording to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh "was a victim of the anger and hostility" of the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's unscrupulous and shameful human rights practices", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump reported that Kavanaugh "was subject to the wrath and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on the day of the wedding, honestly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's claim that he had sexually assaulted her years earlier when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial of her preference.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw the gifted, capable and courageous Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to impeach Kavanaugh is a vote to impeach one of the most gifted legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a record of public service", he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination while discussing the importance of Republican rallies for the midterm elections.
Five weeks from the most important decision of our lives.
"I do not raise the dead", he said, "but I raise them up".
That is why I strive in every way to be a good candidate.
Trump wanted to make the Democrats unwilling to act against and prevent.
The first major Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is not expected until Friday, a GOP aide told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and the number is rising
At least 384 people were killed and many were left stranded when heavy rains washed up on the coast after a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
On the Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival at the beach of the city of Pau, when about six feet of water fell from the beach, killing many and destroying everything on the way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami hit yesterday, people were still operating on the beach and did not immediately evacuate and became victims", BNPB disaster prevention agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it hit cars, trees, houses, it hit everything in its path", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open ocean at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
Some people tried to climb trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were moved to 24 locations in Palu.
Aerial photographs of the disaster site showed many ruined buildings and shops, torn and dilapidated bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On the Sabbath, the earth shook most of the coastal towns.
The earthquake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) announced in a report that the energy released in Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's land, which is on the edge of a long, narrow bay, may have made the tsunami worse, he predicted.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, supermarkets and guesthouses were razed to the ground.
Some bodies were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were rescued and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the damage was likely higher at 300 km (190 mi) along the coast north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter.
Relationships are completely paralyzed with no knowledge from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that workers and volunteers were on their way to the affected area.
"This is already a sorrow, but it can be worse", they said.
On the Sabbath they were very careful to read the Scriptures, lest a storm should strike, for the day was almost past.
In private recordings shared on social media, a top man on the top floor of a building can be heard warning people on the street about the coming tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water runs along the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to directly monitor the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a widespread disruption that severed communication about Palu, making it very difficult for authorities to communicate rescue information.
The army has begun sending farm planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but more evacuees still need food and other essential supplies.
The city's airport has reopened, only for emergency purposes, and will be closed until October.
Joko Widodo, the president, was scheduled to visit refugee camps in Palu on Sunday.
The number of people killed in the Indonesian tsunami now exceeds 800.
It's not good.
While World Vision staff arrived safely at Palu from Donggala, where workers were holed up in the shadows of the presentation in the garden outside the office, they arrived at the devastated sites, Mr. Doseba said.
"We saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's bad.
When the tumult was over, some of the brothers began to complain, "The Greeks and the Herodians are not allowed to come to Paul to help him".
According to Indonesian accounts, foreign competition, equipment and manpower can only come if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a national disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
The governor says, "Okay, this is a national disaster, so we can open up for international aid, but there's nothing new yet".
Late in the evening in Pau, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and relatives of the missing hope that their loved ones will be surprised to survive the ordeal after the disaster.
On a Sabbath a man was there who was being carried out of a well.
On Sunday, rescuers uncovered a woman who had been trapped under a rock wall for two days with her mother's body lying under her lap.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had won two of the four games for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"Like a paraglider in the field, so I carry my own burden of feeling", he said.
Mr Gendon reported that within hours of the news circulating in the paragliding community that the Roa Roa Hotel had been terrorized, he had e-mailed WhatsApp messages to participants in Palu who were at the festival on the beach.
But the commandment only made one winged bird, not two blue.
Does that mean that the law was not broken?
Thieves take $26,750 in the form of a refill from a Newport, La.
A thief stole $26,750 from a Brink employee Friday morning while filling a car in Newport on Levee, according to a news release from Newport Police.
The driver of the car had exhausted a breath of fresh air during the meeting and was going after more money, secret service agent Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While he was spending, another man came running up behind and stole the money bag.
Witnesses saw several of the attackers fleeing the scene, as described in the scripture, but the police could not determine how many people had gathered.
Anyone with knowledge of their relationship should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
In the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: Formerly known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been using the moniker Ye for some time and also used the name on his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He will be joined by singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled the program for "personal reasons", according to the show's creators.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I believe the word 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing the album title with radio host, Big Boy.
"So am I, you are, we are.
It went from Kanye, meaning the only one, to just Ye -- a picture of our good, our small, our desolate whole.
The wing is more of a reflection of who we are.
He is one of many rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West's, Jay-Z, has also done with or without binding strips and large bars.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the military against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody revenge attack on readers.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never in his life use the military to beat down the Mexican people.
Soldiers fired at a peaceful march on the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were rising in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly reading classes and opening more public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving young people into criminal relationships.
The United States had a double-digit deficit on artificial intelligence (AI).
As China becomes more active in intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this area, says investor Kai-Fu Lee, who is a top intelligence analyst who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several in the US government made similar announcements, even though the US as a whole has no firm intention to do so.
Meanwhile, China came out with its goal last year: to be at the forefront of smart innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for such a grant would be a good start, because all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are still looking for a decisive step for that", Lee said.
A doubling of the fraud could potentially simultaneously double the chances of the next major such execution in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is a director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most widely held technology companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he attended Carnegie Mellon University, where he worked on a logic puzzle that won against the best American actor in Othello, and later became head of Microsoft Research and head of Google in China.
Lee acknowledged a previous competition of the US government, now the Defense Advanced Research Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would take place so he could see the next think tank.
Foreigners in the United States often have to work hard to earn a college education, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking academic leaders away; it's businesses", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have attracted university graduates to work on similar projects in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also be beneficial to the United States to promote the experiment with wisdom.
I think that work and living permits should be given to people with a doctorate in this way, he said.
The State Council of China announced its next generation education plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions, similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government agencies provide funding to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together industry and academia, and the White House announced the selection of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a project called AI Next.
In contrast, NSF is currently investing $100 million a year in similar projects.
Meanwhile, US legislation attempting to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been inactive for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether the country's name will be changed
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a change that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that has prevented it from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a landlocked country called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern border represents a claim to its territory and has banned its accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name proposal, but nationalist opponents point out that the change will damage the national identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in the referendum and a ban on communications has cast doubt on whether the company will meet the minimum requirement for a referendum vote of 50 percent.
The question on the ballot is: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by ratifying the agreement from Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, suggest that this is what is needed to push for accession to the councils, such as the EU and NATO, of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the dissolution of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it means we all have a safer life", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not required by law, some members of parliament have said that they will act on the outcome of the election and make it decisive.
The name change requires the two-thirds majority of the parliament.
The state police said nothing irregular had happened at 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent at the last general election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
"I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and son Dushko vote in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name and thereby gain entry to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Outside the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and high chairs for tents that were torn up for those who want to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go in front, not through the back door", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have respect.
If they don't want us to be like Macedonia, then we can go to other countries like China or Russia and be part of the European Union.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will provide much needed investment in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is above 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will vote for it, because more than 80 percent of our population is for the EU and NATO", Zaev said after he announced his vote.
He said that a "yes" would become a "no" for the future.
A poll last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than the required participation.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the sub-group must be at least 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious blow to the policy of the Western-led government since it took over in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City manages to break through Brighton's defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling quickly broke down the Brighton defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look like he was playing lightly when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian rider received a transmission midway through the start of the rally.
He went full-time around three Brighton defenders before running free across the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green droughts.
He passed a defender and then ran from several on the edge of the Brighton break.
He sent the ball to his left, where he found Sterling.
The English striker sent the ball back to Aguero with his first nerting, who used his right gait to send the ball forward to Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan, with a shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his legs", City manager Pep Guardiola told the media.
We talked about letting him play 55, 60 minutes.
And that is what happened.
We were lucky that he scored exactly then.
But it was Sterling who gave them the sky blue lead in the Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero then scored a deep inside goal on Brighton's penalty kick.
He sent a beautiful run up on the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few nerds before leading Sterling to the wrist.
The sky-blowing advance man shot the ball into the court just before he left the court.
City face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to use the outbreak against the Rockies.
With the Nationals unable to reach the final, there was no need to start again.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but if the Rockies can make the playoffs, they are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies secured a wild-card spot with a 5-2 victory at Nationals on Friday night, but will still attempt to win their first division title.
Even if we don't play for anything, we can at least throw, knowing that the song in the Denver crowd will be good and that the team will most likely play at the highest level I've met this year.
Why should I not take the time to run?
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start Sunday, but rumors are that they are leaning toward allowing Scherzer to pitch in such a position.
Scherzer, who can start for the 34th time, throws in practice on the wedding day and throws on his rest day if he starts.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump to West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation regarding his nomination to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of the Republican rally for the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is on the line in November.
Five weeks away from the most important decision of our lives.
This is one of the really big ones -- I'm not running, I'm really running, and that's why I'm always running for good candidates", he said.
Trump went on, "You see this horrible, horrible progressive group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They are determined to take back power with all the necessary risks, you see the filthy wickedness.
They do not give to anyone the power and authority they want, and we will not give them that power and authority.
Democrats, he said, are desperate to act against and prevent.
You see it over the last four days, he said, calling the Democrats vicious and evil and unclean and untrue.
He referred to the Senate judiciary, naming Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which caused the audience to shout outrage.
Do you remember her answer?
Have you got the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, wait -- it was a really bad body-shape -- the worst body-shape I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a church room
The evidence of those who say this is unbearable.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for my dismissal, it didn't come as a surprise.
Meanwhile, I am the last in a line of Labour MPs to know that we are not welcome - all to voice their opinions.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way when she consistently fought anti-Semitism.
In my case, the idea of miscalculation came about because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a sound economic policy, of national security, of Europe, of the readiness of the spectrum are questions of the same kind that Jeremy disagreed with former leaders about.
The report of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, stated that we want the meetings to be broad-based and creative.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the conference meeting on Friday night was just that.
However, it is now the case that the tone is not that way at many meetings and the promise of friendly, domestic policies has long since been forgotten, if it ever began at all.
It has consistently been made clear that different views are not accepted in the Labour Party, and all opinions are judged on whether they are welcomed by the leadership of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared a political view, began to expect me to become reticent and have views that I would otherwise never have agreed with - a view now about national security or the internal market in the EU.
Every time I speak out - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there's a flurry of social media posts calling for a re-election, denouncing the MP's policies and saying I shouldn't have joined the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
I know I'm more proud than some of my colleagues, because the comments I get are political.
I have respect for the professionalism and mediocrity of my colleagues who face harsh sexist and racist abuse every day, but never give up.
One of the biggest disappointments in this era of politics is how commonplace the approach has become.
Jeremy Corbyn demanded last week that the Labour Party cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The fact is, we are no longer the broad church, and with all the misunderstandings or rules about election reform, the flock just gets narrower.
For the last two years I have been given many counsels, which have encouraged me to speak in a small way, and to speak in a very small way.
But that's not why I'm in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a schoolboy 32 years ago, encouraged by the Thatcher government and its negligence, which had broken my big-foot party space, I have tried to be an advocate for better public services for those who need them most - whether as a city councillor or a government minister.
I never changed my politics, not even for the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been unconcerned by my political position, including my disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who supported the miscellaneous bill on Friday, I can only say that as the country moves towards a Brexit that will damage our homes, businesses and public services, I did not understand the willingness to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the chairman of the Labour Party.
But my message is certainly not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am honored to serve you and I promise that no fear of re-election or political self-interest will deter me from working for what I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr go to the top
Two late goals may have made the final result a bit skewed, but there is no doubt Ayr would have won the entertaining Tennent's Premiership match today.
They are now the only undefeated team in the top 10.
In the end, it was as much the tight defence as their better disposal of chances that carried the home side, and coach, Peter Murchie, had good reason to be satisfied.
"We are in distress in our struggle, and we are still not defeated. That is why I can only rejoice", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Rose to Ayr, they took the opportunity better than we did".
Grant Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, translated by Frazier Climo, sent Ayr to the wire, but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, released for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to score and Jason Baggot scored a non-translated goal.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a break before, just before half-time, he scored and converted a single and made it 17-5 to Ayr in the end zone.
However, Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's goal, translated by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then came a long break, due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off the field on the farm, and when they started again, Ayr came further ahead after a goal by Stafford McDowall, who was overseen by Climo.
Ayr's team captain Blair Macpherson was provisionally given the yellow card and once again Melrose was outscored by one man, with a non-translated score by Bruce Colvine, after a heavy pressure.
The home side came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for thanking Climo without a ball, MacPherson went all the way from the penalty line, falling behind an advancing Ayr team.
Climo turned, which he did almost immediately after Kyle Rowe received a kick from David Armstrong and sent off the winger, Gregor Henry, who scored the team's fifteenth goal.
Still Game star prepares for new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran is ready to move into the hospitality industry after it was revealed he was named CEO of a popular catering company
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC programme, which he writes and stars in alongside longtime sketch comedian Greg Hemphill.
The producers announced that the ninth episode in hand will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is getting ready for a life after Craiglang.
According to popular records, he is the head of Adriftmorn Limited.
The presenter refuses to comment on the story, although a source at the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to join the burgeoning restaurant industry in Glasgow.
The lake is ours: the embattled Bolivia hopes that justice will open the way to the Pacific Ocean again.

Throughout inland Bolivia, the memory of a beach, lost to Chile in a bloody nineteenth-century battle of reconciliation, still lingers - the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again in the same way.
Hopes may be as high as they have been in centuries, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Criminal Court on October 1 after five years of chaos.
"Bolivia has a sense of purpose and dignity and is expecting a fair result", said Roverto Calzadilla, a Bolivian ambassador.
Many Bolivians will watch the decision of the International Court of Justice on the big screen around the country, in the hope that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's wish that - after centuries of unstable negotiations - Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia an independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the native, charismatic president of Bolivia - who faces a contentious re-election battle next year - will also be pushed to the decision on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he promised late August.
However, some observers believe that it is unlikely that the judiciary will vote for Bolivia - and that little will change if it does vote.
The Dutch parliament has no authority to hand over a key area and has stated that it will not decide the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the final reasons were given shows that the case is not closed", said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than advance Bolivia's story, the last four years have probably made it worse.
"The issue of access to the sea has been overcome by the current situation in Bolivia", Zarate said.
Morales's manly rhetoric has removed the remnants of goodwill, if any, she scolded.
Bolivia and Chile will occasionally talk again, but it will be extremely difficult to agree after this.
The two countries have not had ambassadors in each other's countries since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, pointed out that the court's thinking was unusually rapid.
Monday will be a unique opportunity for Bolivia to enter into a new relationship with Chile and a chance to end a 139-year-old dispute with the union's leaders, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - who remains a well-liked president in Latin America - used naval warfare as a political weapon.
Bolivia is about to give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The decision allows us to see that we must look to the past.
North Korea insists that they will not disarm their nuclear weapons unless they can rely on the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never disarm its nuclear weapons unless it can count on Washington.
Ri spoke at the general meeting of ST.
He urged the United States to keep its commitments made at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the countries.
His comments come in the wake of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's announcement that he would begin the use of nuclear weapons more than three months after Singapore's with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a Chinese dream to continue to make American claims and appeals to a declaration that the Korean War is over, that North Korea will ever be delimited.
Washington is wary of a deal on disarmament unless Pyongyang makes significant changes to its disarmament policy.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang will actually abandon a nuclear weapons stockpile, which it certainly sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris unveiled the latest line in large headwear, which is on its way to your main street.
If you want to expand your collection of hats or completely rock the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of wacky, oversized headgear for their SS19 line at the entrance, which dazzled the style that was being introduced at the Paris Fashion Show.
Very loose hats have been all over Instagram this summer and these designers have posted their glamorous models up after the chain event.
Valentino's particular costume was an overly determined, gray-brown hat adorned with a feather-like, large shadow that filled the models' heads.
Other excess oil was a spicy watermelon, a cloves' head, and a pineapple, but these were not meant to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a range of unique Halloween masks.
Many of the colorful masks have retro-sewn wares and are more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than fine scraped silhouette.
The first was like a frog with hooves and spectacles, and the second was like a molten copper jar.
And if you look beyond the great fashion show, you're in luck.
Fashion experts expect the ugly hats to soon be found on many main streets.
The unusually large hats come in the shades of La Bomba, the wooden hat with a two-foot shade seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult icon behind the loose hats, which was ubiquitous on social media, also led to another, larger creation on the chain's doorstep - a straw beach bag, almost as big as the swimsuit model who wears it.
The flaming yellow wooden bag, with fringes and a white leather handle, was the most prominent piece of the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus at the Paris Fashion Show.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the high streets next summer - now that the stylist has made such an impact, it's going to be hard to avoid the demand for oversized loans".
John Edward: Language skills are critical to global citizenship
The Scottish free schools maintain a record of academic excellence and this has continued in 2018 with exceptionally good test results once again, only reinforced by good results in individual and team sports, art, music and other team experiences.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best services for their pupils and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As a teaching discipline that can shape and seam a curriculum, we see many modern languages being chosen as subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he knows, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.
This is a strong reminder that we can't rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the exam results this year, we see that the languages have topped the list of highest percentage of those taking the exam in free schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who read a foreign language scored the highest.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students scored highest in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who had German, 69 percent of those who had French, and 63 percent of those who had Spanish also scored high.
This shows that free schools in Scotland are embracing the importance of foreign languages, and that children and young people will need them in the future.
Subjects such as choice are now considered on a par with STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math) in the curriculum of free schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17% of the reasons employers struggle to fill vacancies were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
As more and more jobs in the future will require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Despite the profession of some, it is only an advantage in their future to have learned a foreign language and to have a lifelong virtue.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries puts a multi-talented person ahead of his or her competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent were not proficient enough in a foreign language to have a conversation, and French was the only spoken language with a two-digit percentage, at 15 percent.
That is why an investment in language education is now important for children.
Knowing more languages, especially those spoken in countries with a developed economy, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, the language of instruction varies from school to school.
Many schools focus on the classical modern languages, while others teach in languages that are expected to be of most importance to the UK, with a view to 2020 being Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there is always a wide variety of subjects to choose from in free schools, with specialized teachers.
Scottish free schools work centrally to provide an learning environment that prepares children and equips them with virtues that are a prerequisite for success, whatever the future entails.
It cannot be denied now, in a global business environment, that languages are still very important for the future of a country, so this must also be reflected in schoolwork.
Modern languages should indeed be considered as universal communication skills.
Free schools will continue to offer these choices, diversity and benefits to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edwards is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron prepares for his first Lakers game Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who are looking forward to seeing LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the practice game against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
However, the exact number of minutes he will receive is still unknown.
"It's more than one and less than 48", Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James's playing time would be limited.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six practice games.
"I don't need a training course at this stage of my career to be smart", he said.
Trump's meeting time in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will begin a series of meetings this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five planned meetings for Trump next week, including stops in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the tide of his re-election to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat is coming to a halt, Trump is planning to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the November vote.
When is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is set for 7pm ET on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can stream Trump's West Virginia rally live on YouTube below.
Trump is likely to address the case of Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court this week, a situation sparked by a sexual misconduct allegation in which a Senate spirit decision was temporarily suspended for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of this series of meetings is to help Republicans get elected in November.
Trump's team has announced that five meetings next week will be designed to strengthen the support of Republicans as they seek to defend and increase their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"Power in Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we approach a time of emergency", a Trump spokesman, who declined to be identified, told Reuters.
The eighth meeting at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling this evening is likely to draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and receive media coverage in Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday marks the second time in less than a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won with more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump tries to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is running in the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president will have to come and support him in the election", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows fighting spirit to keep its hopes alive ahead of Sunday's singles.
After three days of the other side talking, the two-on-two game on Saturday was probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed,
The swinging pendulum of the forearm is a perfectly relaxed concept in sports, but it is something that players believe in and cling to, and never more so than in competitions like these.
So who has the advantage now?
"They were six points ahead and now they're only four, so I think we have a slight advantage right now", Jordan Spieth said as he finished the day.
Europe, of course, are ahead, with four points to go and twelve to play.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel they have some wind in their sails, however, and they have plenty to propel underneath it, not least the gait of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and can swing three out of four possible moves.
Spieth has been extremely dangerous from the first stroke to the flat around the hole and runs on the wing.
The cheerleaders grew harder as he rounded each round, where he missed a crucial putt and tied in the fourth, after he and Thomas were two shots behind.
The pitcher who won the match on the 15th hole was celebrated with similar shouts, the kind that warns you that he doesn't like the American team out.
"You just have to dig deep and think about your own game", Spieth said.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to put your mind to.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undefeated history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's multi-ethnic and at the same time attractive couples have four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
Mollwood were the only pair not to shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided shooting a bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and on the final nine holes of Friday morning.
This move, as well as the way the storm seems to flow both to and from the spectator, confirms that they are the winners on Sunday, and the only popular players who can possibly confirm a European victory, now that the sun is setting on Le Golf National, are Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different caves.
However, there is not much talk about European honour.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly eliminated Sergio Garcia, the Spanish hero with four balls this morning, when he was playing Alex Noren.
A bow and two doubles on the first nine buried the Spaniard and the spear in a hole from which they were never able to escape.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of the pit.
Both the two-player and four-player game are so interesting to watch from a short distance, because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how a plan can change in time.
Europe has played better as a team through to the final and are well ahead before the final day, but these two-match series have also shown Team USA's belligerent spirit, which some, especially the Stateside, have questioned.
Europe leads 10-6 before the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has the lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup, after coming out of the four-ball bracket on Saturday with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The impressive pair, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led by two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods and took their lead at Le Golf National by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to regain the steady lead they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, had defeated a U.S. team that failed to start in the four-ball game this morning, winning 3-1.
The United States was more competitive in the doubles, winning two games but failing to close the gap.
Jim Furyk's team will have eight points in the 12 individual events on Sunday to regain the reigns.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, nicknamed Mollwood, after a successful weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball match, they played well together and defeated Woods and American starter Bryson Dechambeau in a close game by an even more decisive 5&4.
Woods, who was out for two games on Saturday, showed signs of a strong season, but he has now lost 19 of 29 games with four shutouts in addition to two doubles games, and has lost seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested this morning for the four-ball games, returned to his teammate, Henrik Stenson, in the doubles with a 2&1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - world number one and number three.
However, the European team did not get everything they wanted on a nice, cool day in a view from Paris.
Three-time major champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas edged the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They scored a stunning 2&1 win over the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-ball match, and later came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the doubles, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point lead before the singles, although Furyk's team, which won last year, only needed a draw to regain the lead.
After being away for two days, it is unlikely that they will be able to return on Sunday.
North Korea says "no" to disarmament alone without consultation
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued confessions were increasing distrust in the United States and that there was no possibility of the country abandoning its nuclear weapons alone under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told a meeting of the international community that North Korea has made significant goodwill moves in the past year, including ending nuclear weapons and missile tests, removing its nuclear weapons status, and pledging to not increase the number of nuclear weapons in its nuclear arsenal.
"But we don't see any corresponding response from the United States", he said.
"If we do not trust the United States, we do not trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will not disarm alone first".
While Ri repeated well-known complaints about Washington's opposition to a gradual approach to disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded gradually, his account seems to suggest that they did not reject the complete disarmament of Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward a demilitarization of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump pledged North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has demanded that Pyongyang first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for tough, global action against North Korea.
The US stands by its disarmament principle and increases pressure on the confederation to achieve its goals in a necessary way, and is still opposed to declaring an end to the war, Ri said.
The fear that confessions can bring us down is a wishful dream for people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the constant confessions only increase our misunderstanding.
Ri made no mention of plans for a new Kim-Trump summit, which the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister also highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: "If the disarmament issue came from South Korea and not the United States, the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not be as firm as it is now.
So famous was the tone of Ri's speech that it was a stark contrast to last year's speech when he told the US General Assembly that the US mainland was not immune to North Korean missiles after President Trump called Kim a suicide rocket launcher.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally annihilate" North Korea, praised Kim for his courageous steps toward disarmament, but said there was still much work to be done and that confessions needed to be made before North Korea could disarm.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeline for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years, five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should have recognized Pyongyang before taking action.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The push for the Security Council's recognition must continue unabated and unabated until we see a sanctioned, final, affirmative disarmament".
The Security Council has unanimously increased its recognition of North Korea since 2006 in an effort to cut off Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile proliferation.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a new meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and claimed progress was being made before North Korea within hours accused him of making criminal demands.
North Korea pledged, at a meeting with Moon this month, to take down a missile base and a nuclear site if the United States carried out a corresponding attack.
He said Kim told him that the corresponding conflict he wanted was a guarantee of security, which Trump had promised in Singapore and moving toward a more normal relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take courses to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year has given its readers more sleep, in an attempt to combat the growing self-righteous mania of reading through caffeinated all-nighters.
One academic warned that students at the world's top universities are often completely helpless when it comes to taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to do the course after he gave a lecture on the effects of insomnia on learning.
And the daughter-in-law said unto me, Why is it that no man hath told me this, until now, when I am old?
She said that no one had ever explained to her the importance of sleep - which came as a surprise to me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, offered for the first time this year, provides students with key insights into how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve well-being and well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the university's health program, said the university decided to introduce the program after being warned that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation.
The hour-long session consists of a series of collaborative tasks.
One part features a picture of a typical room where students press on coffee cups, curtains, shoes and books and are told about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sports performance is affected by insomnia, as well as the importance of a sleep schedule.
In another part, students are given a presentation on how prolonged insomnia can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, diarrhea and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we think they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health risks of choosing to smoke", added Prof Czeisler.
The sense of pride in staying up all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students makes insomnia a growing problem.
Making sure you get enough, good sleep, should be a student's secret weapon to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid getting high, because insomnia puts the brain in a starvation state, making them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies physiology and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler with the course after taking a course from him last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the faculty had opened his eyes and inspired him to try for a faculty position at the university.
The next step, he hopes, will be to get students to continue to complete similar courses before they go to competitive institutes.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm clock when they have to go to bed, and one when they have to get up, and be aware of the effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can make your living room uncomfortable, making it difficult for you to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal of Menga lower league men by Gerrard
Rangers suffered another disappointing outing when Dolly Menga's goal gave Steven Gerrard's unevenly matched side a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox were looking for their first away win since a 4-1 defeat at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side managed to give Gerrard their second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving them eight points behind Hearts, who have been relegated to the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Meng scored seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers' lineup, without inspiration, never seemed to even up.
While Rangers now drop to sixth place, Livingston move up to third, tied with Hibernian, only with a worse goal difference.
And there could be more problems ahead for the Rangers after linebacker Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after something was obviously torn from the outside crowd.
Gerrard made eight substitutions as the team were eliminated by Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, started with the same 11 who took the lead from Hearts in the final week, and he has been overwhelmed by the way the well-oiled team has been beating the opposition every chance they have.
The Rangers may have had more on the ball, but Livingston did more with him when they had him.
They should have scored two minutes into the first half when Menga sent Scott Pittman off against Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big chance by shooting ahead of the goal.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found team captain Craig Halkett, but defender Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot forward from the right-hand stump.
Rangers came to dominate the game, but there were obvious hopes rather than beliefs in the final third.
Alfredo Morales claimed he had a broken leg after a short collision with Steven Lawless, but the referee, Steven Thomson, dismissed the Colombian's claims.
Rangers managed just two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was badly injured by Lassana Coulibaly's scalper and a slow shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Even if Levi's goal after 34 minutes was possibly against the pace of the game, their effort was so strong that no one could deny that it was a draw.
Again, Rangers failed to get a long free throw from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who accidentally put Menga up so he could easily shoot into the goal
Gerrard made a change of pace when he replaced Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the substitution had almost an immediate impact as Morelos was put on the bench, but a fractured Kelly played out of the line and blocked.
However, Livingston continued to get the visitors to play, exactly as they wanted, with Lithgow and Halkett routing long balls away time after time.
Holt's side had managed to double the lead at the end of the match, but McGregor was well prepared to deny Jacobs before Lithgow sent a scorer ahead of the goal after the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton also had a break kick claimed by Jacobs, but again Thomson was looked down upon.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
Now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and that TALER -- the day that the future alchemist, Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in his home in Germany.
Geiger devised a way to protect and measure radiation activity, an invention that eventually became known as the Geiger counter.
Much of science has since been written about the Geiger counter, and the Geiger counter also became a widespread part of popular culture in the 1950 film Bells of Colorado, starring the two scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in heaven's name is that?"
Rogers: Hatta is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive rock, now uranium.
If you look at this main part, you hear the effect of the atoms that radiation in the rocks gives off.
Evans: Tell me, now it really smells!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.

A trial report shows positive outcomes for patients with various types of cancer.
A woman who was given the power of the opposing force to recognize unmistakable signs saw that the cancer of her testicles, which had plagued her for more than eighteen months, had healed.
This human gene involves extracting resistant cells from a patient, as well as modifying them in the laboratory so that they can detect a protein common in many types of cancer, called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results show that we have a very promising case.
HER2 is involved in many cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and endometrial cancer, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to taking resistant genes from patients and teaching them to mimic cancer has been used in the treatment of a type of blood cancer.
Kanye West went into Holt with an unlikely pro-Trump rant, in a MAGA HAT, after his SNL performance.
It's not going well
Kanye West was called off the stage of the television station during Saturday Night Live, after a dissenting performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced his intention to run in 2020.
After performing his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, in a Make America Great cap, he began to speak out against Democrats and renewed his support for Trump.
I often argue with a white person and they say, "How can you love Trump, he's a racist?"
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago", he said.
SNL began the evening with a commercial with Matt Damon, which featured Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the grand jury regarding the sexual assault allegations against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the tapes of West's performance were posted on social media by the show's host, Chris Rock.
It is unknown whether Rock was trying to anger West with his suggestion.
West had also complained to the audience that he had been treated harshly by the Senate for his headgear.
They kicked me out of the park.
"Let it not be", they said, "that it may not go out into the desert".
They attacked me!
And then they say I'm in a deserted place", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West said, "Do you want to see the deserted city?" He said, "He wanted to put on the hero's cap, because it means no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?"
Follow the way of love.
His comments caused at least two rounds of screaming from viewers, and SNL actors seemed to be upset, Variety reported, with one person in the article saying: "The whole network was upset".
West was admitted as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former lover, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West was particularly saddened by his performance of the song I Love It when he was in a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the Conservative Party, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR SET UP AGAINST HARKALIDNESS.
But the host of the event, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West is just who he is, and that's absolutely wonderful.
I do not buy anyone's music or clothes or buy his artwork, so I keep and spread a negative opinion about my church.
He is free.
And so are we", she added.
Prior to the broadcast, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to veran, formerly known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to have changed his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The co-founder, Snoop Dogg, has been credited as Snoop Lion and not to be confused with the music hero Prince, a soul who changed his name to symbolize the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder after knife fight in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused is expected to appear in the court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges are reviewed by the public prosecution.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington is in a state of amazing masculinity.
Kit Harrington is best known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in the HBO horror, medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor resents the common image of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the stage often make young boys think they have to be tough to get respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes the matchmaking has gone wrong and questioned how this issue of gender bias can be addressed under the #MeToo movement.
Kit, who recently married one of the main characters of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he has strong feelings about her problem.
I think personally, especially at this time, where did we go wrong with humanity?"
What have we taught people as they grow up in the face of the crisis we see today?
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increasingly masculine gender, as there are so many male roles.
"What did you learn? " asked the governor". What did you learn?"
What is being taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys think they have to be men like that?
I think that's really one of the big questions right now -- how do we change that?
It is obvious that something is wrong with the young people.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any exceptions or continue Game of Thrones when the show ended next summer, adding that he was fond of the castle and the horses.
From November, Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a film producer and his thief brother.
The actor also recently revealed that he thought the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was meeting his wife, Rose.
I met my wife in this mission, so in many ways it gave me my future family, and my life from now on", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning television series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, according to health officials.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of new cases were later born through sexual intercourse, a change from earlier cases.
HIV usually spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of contaminated blood circulation.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a press conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Further transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a pressing issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
The reason for the spread of diseases is in most cases the lack of prevention in these areas.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised public access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to root out the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that employees leaked the Republican senator's personal data and charges "confusing lies" and "conspiracy"
The U.S. Attorney, Maxine Waters, condemns allegations that an employee of her has posted personal information of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the election was controlled by ultra-right-wing experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and more vile lies", Waters said in a tweet.
The leaked information reportedly included the current address and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information went online on the day of the wedding, broadcast by an unknown person on Capitol Hill, as the Senate's sexual misconduct trial of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was underway.
Lekin came shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address, which determines who made the data, contacted Waters' office and sent out information about one of Waters' employees, Hill reported.
"These baseless accusations are completely untrue and nothing but lies", Waters continued.
My staff - who have had their bodies confiscated and their personal information and whose safety is at risk as a result of these fraudulent and false claims - were not responsible for the leak of this information.
These baseless accusations are completely untrue and nothing but lies.
Waters's announcement quickly gained online attention, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This evening is full of rage", wrote Fleischer.
This indicates that she has no desire to be a member of the Congress.
If anyone is accused of something he has not done, he is innocent.
They can't handle it.
And they were unable to answer the charges brought against him.
They must be quiet and orderly.
Fleischer seems to compare Waters's response to the Democratic sentiment about Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry at his trial on the day of the wedding.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate seeking to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Great, if it suits you", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her letter had informed the authorities and police of this untrue behavior.
We will hold those responsible accountable for their actions, so that they may be found guilty of causing serious injury or death to any of our brothers.
Johnny English Strikes Again review - Rowan Atkinson without the rush of spy parody
It is now customary to look at the Brexit implications in a new film with a British cast and it seems to be useful in this revival of Johnny English, the action-comedy film - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn
Is self-deprecation, said with a shrug, about how little we take advantage of being a new opportunity to leave the country?
In any case, the tough, flat, unskilled Johnny English has been allowed to watch it once more - and even his name suggests he is a broad comedy created for non-cinematic audiences.
He is, of course, the iconic, secretive spy who, despite his fake glamour, is a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr Bean and a bit of the hawk of the four who, with a rare note, contributes to the Chariots of Fire theme for the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is also based on the international, carefree traveller Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television advertisements, which caused chaos.
There are a couple of good moments in this new JE movie.
I loved when Johnny English approached the turtle in a medieval brooch and the turtle blood briefly glistened against his helmet.
Atkinson's physical prowess is shown, but the song feels a bit unmotivated and unnecessary at times, especially when the half-dozen films, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, are now also full of humor.
It feels like the comedy is more for kids than adults, and I don't think Johnny English's crazy misadventures are as inventive and central as Atkinson's silent movie finches as Bean.
The story that comes up again and again is that Britain is in big trouble.
A computer hack has infiltrated the top-secret network of spies, exposing the unity of all British spies in the department to the horror of one of the spies on assignment - unfortunately a minor role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw of a prime minister, a hardened creature already torn apart by his political disfavor: Emma Thompson does her least in this quasi-Teresa May role, but there is little to work on in the script.
Her counselors sent her a message that since all the spies had gone astray, she should send a messenger.
And that means the clown Johnny English, who is now principal of some fancy school, but secretly teaching his kids to be spies: something funny is going on here, one that English is running a spy academy like School of Rock.
English is sent to Whitehall for a cancer fund and is reunited with his former, long-suffering partner Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, bound to a racing driver, a frugal, shy role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a wasted piece.
Batman and Robin, for the sake of Her Majesty's royal service, are back, facing the beautiful laywoman Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is taken in by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the unknown Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on a troubled journey of unintelligible antics: dressed as servants, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create a rumble when they sneak aboard Volta's multirole boat; and English unleashes perfect lawlessness when he tries to use a near-reality device to identify Volta's house.
All the steps of the journey are uncertain for the final play, but as gentle and gentle as it is, it is quite similar to a child's play.
It's a really funny thing.
And as with all the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: Can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really shows his potential?
Labour is working on a plan to get Britons to work four days but get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party has a successful plan to get Britons to work four days a week - but get paid for five.
It is said that the party wants company directors to use savings from the AI crash to give employees a day off.
For the workers, this meant that they could enjoy a three-day long week shift - yet still receive the same pay.
Sources say the idea fits well with the party's financial agenda and puts the country in the favor of workers.
A shift to a four-day workweek is approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the shifting economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "A political announcement is expected before the end of the year.
It does not happen in one day, but a four-day workweek is a desire that fits well into the workload of the crew to bring back balance to the economy for the worker, in addition to the crew's overriding enthusiasm.
Labour will not be the first to adopt such a proposal, after the Green Party tried to reduce the workweek to four days in its 2017 election campaign.
The treaty is not fully endorsed by the Labour Party at present.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day workweek is not party policy and is not being considered by the party".
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour conference to express his views on a socialist collapse of the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to win back power from corrupt governments and drug lords.
The shadow chancellor's promises also mean that current shareholders of waterworks may not get all their shares back, as the Labour government plans to make cuts in what they consider to be illegal.
He also supported plans to appoint workers to the boards of companies and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds to hand over 10 per cent of the share capital of private companies to employees who stand to receive an annual profit margin of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss in 60 Minutes how the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh may change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final decision on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the Commonwealth's policy decisions could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asks Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI might have found something that would have changed their minds.
Kennedy seems more open than his colleague from Southern California.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
I said before the trial, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
And I called him after this had happened, and the accusation came forth, and I said, Didst thou do this?
He was firm, steadfast, and unwavering.
Graham's vote, on the other hand, does not seem to be changing.
"I know about Brett Kavanaugh and it would have required a powerful indictment", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett denied it vehemently", Graham added, and nodded to Christine Blasey Ford.
And all who are named by her cannot resist her.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new that would change it.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Has It Done Anything to Reduce Poverty?
Now on Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival featuring a vibrant roster of star performers and an equally vibrant campaign to end global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn in Central Park, not only to experience performances by some of today's Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to shed light on the true purpose of this event, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an initiative of the Global Poverty Project, a global charity that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you would like to pay for a VIP ticket), people attending concerts must complete a series of tasks, or activities such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or otherwise doing something meaningful to help shed light on the cause of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in 12 years of pursuing its mission?
Is the idea of giving people a free access token a real way to convince people to shout out, or is it just another case of so-called "clickism" - that people feel they are making a real difference by signing an online protest letter, or tweeting a message?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has registered more than 19 million contributions from its contributors, which have encouraged a variety of causes.
He says these actions have prompted world leaders to announce commitments and guarantees worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to affect more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the organization had 390 fundraisers and fundraising events, with at least $10 billion already raised.
The association estimates that the money supply has directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most notable findings include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs dedicated to helping children reach their full developmental potential, with a pledge to give Rwanda $35 million to end the country's food shortage, following more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
With the support of the UK government, donations, governments in other countries, and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice and malnutrition a footnote in history", said The Power of Nutrition spokeswoman Tracey Ullman to an audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The association also said that after more than 5,000 applications were submitted, in a call to the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition assistance.
In response to one of our people on his website asking, "How do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen replied:It's going to be a long and hard journey - sometimes it's going to fail.
But just like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we're going to succeed because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are among the names who will perform at this year's event in New York, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman hosting.
US may use Navy as a tool to block Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington may use its navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke has revealed, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's activity in Syria - especially where it is at the request of the legitimate government - is a prelude to exploring new energy markets.
I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the healthier hub of Europe, he said, after all.
And according to the authorities, there are different ways to handle it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that shipping lanes are open and, if necessary, prevent, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market", he said.
Zinke addressed the audience at an event of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a public interest group called the Voice of the Energy Consumer in the United States.
He began to compare Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they were largely similar.
"The economic potential with Iran and Russia is, to a large extent, just to have power over and exchange fuels", he said, pointing to Russia as a country that only produces one thing and is economically dependent on biofuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration has been desperate to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
In contrast, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the pending Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which will double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion capacity, is nothing more than a financial project.
The Kremlin maintains that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is purely for financial reasons, and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to relieve pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their hosts", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said at a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The attitude of the United States has given Germany a negative impression, having otherwise reasserted its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from ST's energy policy, including the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes in our energy supply", Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said at a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren to consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
At a meeting at the Council House in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren announced that she was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and understand the failure of government and that includes women in senior positions", she said, according to The Hill.
On the evening of November 6, I will consider whether to run for president.
Warren mentioned his thoughts on Donald Trump, the president, in the Cabinet, saying that he was running the country on a crooked kiss.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been critical of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has been outspoken.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote, "We need an FBI investigation before the vote".
A poll released on the day of the wedding, however, showed that a majority of Warren's voters believe she will not run in 2020.
Thirty-five percent of likely Massachusetts voters said the senator would not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported the position.
The election results showed that support was greater for a nomination by former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a nomination and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democratic names mentioned for possible nomination in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a final decision in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin performs PTSD with Track Palin at the Donald Trump Summit
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the Army in September
He was arrested and charged with inciting a disturbance at the home on Thursday evening.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after he gets home, makes me feel for other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD, including the injuries of some of our returning soldiers", she told an audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paul referred to his imprisonment as a problem that was obvious to everyone, but no one cared and said about his son and other old soldiers, they are coming back a little different, they are shepherds, they are coming back and thinking about whether respect for what fellow soldiers and pilots and all the others in the army have given the country
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support challenge to new peace-keeping policies
Eight states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit against a new U.S. policy that prohibits giving peace vests to people fleeing domestic violence or violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and territories filed a pro-right plea agreement Friday in Washington to support a political asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the August lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Commonwealth Policy of Grace v. Sessions has not been released.
She claimed that her partner and his violent sons, who were part of a gang, had abused her, but U.S. officials denied her request for a truce on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace cited El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries with serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy on peace shields overturned a 2014 immigration court ruling that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for peace shields.
District of Columbia Governor Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "prepares for the end of a decade of state, commonwealth and international law".
Commonwealth law requires that all peaceful disputes be judged on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the case, and such a prohibition violates this principle, which is set out in the Charter of Friendship.
Prosecutors further criticized the policy of denying immigrants entry to the U.S. economy, saying they were more likely to become entrepreneurs and "save essential labor".
President Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer provide peace vests to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Peace refugees are those who flee their home countries as a result of persecution or fear because of their ethnicity, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group, or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 policy statement.
The helmet of peace was never meant to cure all the problems -- especially all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Hopelessly saved by Paul, now twice as many dead trying to find their way out.
For those who survived, the situation continued to be appalling.
"It feels very exhausting", said the 35-year-old mother, Giza Kusuma, as she nursed her fever-stricken son in a refugee camp in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute the ambulance arrives with bodies.
Clean water is self-sufficient.
Residents were seen returning to their homes, trying to save anyone they could find among the drowned and the bodies.
Hundreds were injured and hospitals were severely damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake, which overflowed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who had broken his back and axle, lay outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to continuous aftershocks.
His eyes filled with tears as he related the sensation of the terrible quake in the guest room of the fifth floor apartment he shared with his wife and daughter.
"It was not time to save ourselves.
I was crushed into what was left of the walls, I think", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that the family was in town for a hideout.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then I was crying.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.
US Ambassador accuses China of "threatening" with "propaganda"
A week after a nationwide Chinese newspaper published a four-page article in a US newspaper praising the benefits of cooperation in US-China trade, the Chinese ambassador accused Beijing of using US media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday pointed to the paid profile of China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to run for the November 6 US House of Representatives election, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in US elections is a sign, US officials told Reuters, of a new shift in Washington's election strategy to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to make declarations in an attempt to stimulate trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war that has led to higher tariffs on imports from both sides.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were aimed at curbing expatriates in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing taxed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in the Des Moines Register Sunday, encourages gambling by printing propaganda statements in our own free press.
"In spreading its propaganda, China abuses American values, free speech and free press by publishing statements in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"By comparison, you can find in newspaper stores down the street here in Beijing, limited, diffuse voices and no real thoughts about the incompatible opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's difficult economic situation, because the Chinese Communist Party controls the media", he wrote.
He added that one of the most prominent newspapers in China had turned down an offer to publish his article, but he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans challenge female voters ahead of midterm election with Kavanugh's defeat, warn analysts
While many senior Republicans await and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh amid accusations of sexual assault, analysts warn they will experience a comeback, especially from women, for the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment on the outside has been overwhelming, and most Republicans have already said they are in favor of a vote.
These cases are irreversible", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Ariz.) attempt at a twelfth hour of FBI investigation would be enough to sway voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the pro-choice movement MoveOn, on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" as they protested in the lobby of the Senate, while Republicans in control of the judiciary voted to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic denied.
"Democratic ambition and accountability will be fine", Stu Rothenberg, an independent political commentator, told the news site.
People say it's been high, and that's true.
But it may be higher, especially among swinging, female voters in the diaspora and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who, although they dislike the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford's public statement, in which she made her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts expected a comeback if Republicans pushed through the threat.
"This has become a Republican Party whorehouse", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not even about the nomination vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh gets the seat, it's about how Republicans handled this and how they handled her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news conference.
However, Americans seem to be divided on who to believe, according to Frod and Kavanaugh's reports, with a small majority leaning toward the latter.
A recent YouGov poll showed that 41 percent of those asked were either completely or partially convinced by Ford's report, while 35 percent said they were totally or partially convinced by Kavanaugh,
In a survey, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh mostly or completely lied in the report, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's debts and at least one additional charge, reported Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before a Senate jury last week that Kavanaugh, while in the military, raped her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee referred her to her gender at a wedding while both were law students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web (WWW), starts a newly formed company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech giant's latest project, Intrupt, is a project based on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to their information.
In a separate interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the tagline for Inrupt is "global warming".
"We should do it now", he said of the work.
It is a historic promise.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal database online or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music files, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all on the same cage at the same time.
The unique feature of the personal data base on the web is that it is entirely up to the user who can access which information.
The verb refers to the personal authority argument through data.
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is that the company can provide tools, access and thinking skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The project is currently compiled by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired from IBM, a few contracted employees who develop the project as well as a community of volunteer programmers.
This week, developers around the world will begin to create their own mid-range apps, using the tool on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether they will come up with a complete overhaul that would see all their business models tested in one day.
We do not ask permission from them.
In an article on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the purpose of Inrupt is to provide a business force and ecosystem that helps protect the purity and integrity of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a leading voice in the debate about net neutrality.
Even now, after Berners-Lee created Inrupt, he remains the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the Internet", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Priest who received the Victoria Cross in World War I, celebrated
The only priest in the Church of England to win a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a soldier was commemorated in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann, a priest, won the medal on 29 September 1918 at the battles of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, unaware that he had won Britain's highest award for gallantry in battle.
A memorial stone was unveiled by both of his abbots at a procession in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
The second abbot, Michael Vann, said it was "very impressive" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the abbot's honourable achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Vann led his division across the Canal de Saint-Quentin through thick darkness while being pursued by cannon and machine guns.
He then rushed to the line of fire and with extraordinary courage led the line before single-handedly running at one cannon and shooting down three in the other company.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - a good month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of the abbot were something I knew I could never live up to, but something that was humble.
He and his brother, Dr James Vann, also laid a wreath at the back of the procession, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was honored to be a part of the screening, adding that the resilience of a true hero is tested by the support that many people will give.
MMA fans were up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine you've been waiting all night to see the dusty Bellator 206 and then you're denied the main part.
The San Jose edition featured 13 matches, including six on the main tour, and was shown live overnight in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6pm, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were surprised when the broadcast was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were surprised to see that they had waited until the early morning, especially for the battle.
One tweeter described the change to the children's show as a "joke of the lie".
"There were government policies that felt the content of the show was not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children's television", said Dave Schwartz, head of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the content.
Peggy Peppa, yes.
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they would work on their file so that viewers in the UK could see it in the future.
I think that when I think about the controversy, we can figure it out", Coker said.
But it's six o'clock Sunday morning there, and we can't solve it until Sunday, our time, Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the change came, there were many requests, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to explain it, but we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a problem with the government.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We cut to five fights instead of six as we normally do - and we tried to give too many shots and we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt he was better off because of his sexuality.
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley said he started to feel inferior because of his sexuality - but that inspired him to do well.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he started high school that people weren't like me.
On the first Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he shone a light on gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that being a parent made him less concerned about winning at the Olympics.
The regular host of the former show, Kirsty Young, has been on a leave of absence for several months due to illness.
As an extra on Laverne's first episode, Daley said that he felt inferior to everyone else growing up because it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls.
He said, "Today, these feelings of weakness and differentness give me the drive and strength to succeed.
He said this to test her, but the people knew who she was.
A two-time Olympic bronze medallist, he has become a strong advocate for LGBT rights and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said this because he felt that he was able to live freely and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - the American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, last year, but he said that the age difference had never been an issue.
When you go through so much in your youth - he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find anyone his age who had gone through the same ups and downs.
The couple had a son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, in June, and Daley said his views had changed completely.
"If you had asked me last year, everything would have turned out to be a gold medal", he said.
You know what, there are more important events than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
The son shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not approve of his dying, and the last thing he asked was if they had their ticket to London 2012 - because he wanted to be first.
I could not tell him, 'Father, you must not stand here,'" he said.
I took him by the hand and he died. But I did not know that he was not defeated until he died.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won bronze.
I just knew that this was my lifelong dream - to compete in front of the home crowd at the Olympics, no better feeling", he said.
It also inspired his first song of choice - Heather Small's Proud - which was a hit in the run-up to the Olympics and still earned him a cult following.

Off-the-record Mickelson on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets the record on Sunday for his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to get going so it's not a boring milestone.
Mickelson, who is playing in the tournament, which is held every two years, for the twelfth time, was tackled on the leg by team captain Jim Furyk for the two-match four-ball game on Saturday.
Instead of being the centerpiece, as he has so often been for the United States, the five-time winner had to divide his day to be more active and work his way up on the field in the hope of getting back in shape.
He has never been the one with the short legs, even when he was at his best, and the 48-year-old does not fit neatly into the Le Golf National course, where the long unscored upon side always penalties counting shots.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will face the eventual British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, in the ninth game on Sunday, who, along with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, has won all four of his matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in the 12 individual events, get a good start, Mickelson's match could be very decisive.
Fear showed her trust in her husband, because he could not say much more.
"He understood his role today, he hit me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He is too confident in himself.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's done so much for these teams before, and this week.
I didn't think he was going to play two games.
I saw him play more, but that's the way it is and that's the way we think we're going to continue.
He just wants to be out there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on a Sunday.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never been as good as his individual career.
Mickelson has won 18, lost 20 and drawn seven, but Furyk says his presence adds something irreplaceable to the team.
"He is cheerful, quick-tempered, quick-tempered, and a good friend in the community", he said.
I also think the younger players have had fun annoying him this week, which was fun to watch.
He's bringing a lot more than just a spark
Europe's leader, Thomas Bjorn, knows that great leaders can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a pretty big lead before the singles on the final day of the Ryder Cup can quickly become a safe experience.
The Danish team had its first taste of success in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but only managed to win by a narrow margin, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You always remind yourself of the big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but just right", said Bjorn, dispirited after watching the 2018 team win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, so they are now 10-6 ahead at Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else that it's not over.
You must go out with everyone tomorrow.
From there, do all the right things.
This is not complete until the steps are completed.
We have a cause, and we're trying to win this rock, and that's what we should be gathering around.
I've always said that I'm focused on the 12 players that are on our team, but we know what's waiting for us on the other side -- the best players in the world.
Satisfied with his players' performance on a round golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't think too far ahead in this.
Tomorrow will be an unusually difficult day.
Tomorrow, the remains of one appear, and there is something else entirely.
It's good to be out there with a partner when you're doing well, but when you're out there alone, all your golfing skills are tested.
These are the rules you must make your players understand, to make the best of themselves tomorrow.
So the one who is married to the one who is married to the other must go on his way to get the good things he wants.
In contrast to Bjorn, the opposing team's captain, Jim Furyk, will see his players perform better as individuals than they did as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four possible.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the great turmoil on the final day, when he was part of a winning team in Brooklyn before ending up as the loser as Europe conquered what is now known as the Miracle of Medina.
"I remember every condemned word of it", he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, had spoken to his players before the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we want to get off to a good start, just like we saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When it is going one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the hamstrings in the middle.
We have done our order and sent the four as we feel, you know, we try to create some movement tomorrow.
Thomas is given the task of starting the MotoGP and meets Rory McIlroy in the top race, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the top half of the sequence.
I chose this team in this order because I think it fits well all the way through", Bjorn said of his selection of individuals.
Germany's new warship once again delayed.
The newest frigate in the German Navy was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War warships, but it won't be until next year due to a lack of systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The addition of Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg fleet of frigates, is now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, citing a spokesman in the army.
The ship was scheduled to enter service in 2014, but problems with the launch plagued the completion of the large-scale project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, which the German Navy ordered in 2007, will replace the ageing Bremen frigates.
They will have a powerful cannon, a barrage of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and technology to become unarmed, a now-limited radar, built-in and acoustic capabilities.
Another feature is longer life - it would be possible to use the newest boats for up to two years away from home.
However, continuing delays mean that the newest warships - which are supposed to serve German power abroad - will be decommissioned once they are in service, Die Zeit shows.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy refused to commission it and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to a port.
The reasons for the dispatch were uncertain, but German sources recorded several significant failures and design failures that made the ship unfit for battle.
The need for programs is particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg capacity will be carried by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the workforce of older Bremen frigates.
When the ship was launched, it was found that the ship was too heavy, that it was sinking and that it was preventing the navy from making any future improvements.
The 7,000-ton Rhine-Palatinate is probably twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the design flaws, the cost of the project - considered manpower - is also a problem.
It is said to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from an initial €2.2 billion.
The threat of the newest frigates is particularly significant given the recent warning of the declining strength of the German Navy.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the defense committee in the German parliament, admitted that the navy actually minimizes ships that can be deployed.
The official said that the problem had become worse over time because old ships were being taken off the shore, and no one was able to get to the place where they were being rescued.
He also complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates were capable of entering the fleet.
The Nature Conservancy is stalking the mysterious lives of flying squirrels
New research on a fire in the Scottish Highlands aims to show how land-based flies use land to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the result will be groundbreaking in the behavior of this particular, flying mammal and help guide future conservation efforts.
The research by scientists from the Scottish Nature Conservancy tracks common and soprano dwarf flying mice, including a brown eagle and Daubenton flying mouse at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special observers are placed at key locations around the property to monitor the activity of the flying mice throughout the year.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile testing with handheld scooters.
Experts in acoustics of all recordings will confirm the frequency of the calls of the mice and what each species is doing.
A population map and report is then made to create a detailed picture of all the landscapes and their behavior.
Rob Dwear, a conservation advisor for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which locations are most important for flying squirrels and how they are used by individual species.
This information helps determine the benefits of growing grasslands, how to make grasslands, and how best to manage forest land for flying mice and other related animals.
The number of flying squirrels in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by buildings and excavations that affect sleep and loss of habitat.
Windmills and light can also be a hazard, as can flypaper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as cat dust.
Flying mice are not really blind.
But because of their nighttime habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echo-confirmation technology to locate insects and bugs in their flight systems.
The NTS, which is responsible for the smoke detection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is considering flying mice.
There are ten specialists who regularly investigate, supervise the resting place and sometimes rescue.
The association has also established the first and only peaceful area of flying foxes in Scotland in the Threave area of Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten flying fox species.
The owner, David Thompson, says the area is an exemplary area for them.
and said, "We have a good harbor near Troas, where we can put our anchor.
We have old buildings, lots of old wood and very good housing.
But there is still a lot of unknown about flying mice, so the work being done here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of screening for mice before comparison is made on buildings, as it is possible that an unintentional destruction of a private resting place can kill up to 400 women and children, possibly removing an entire, closed institution.
The flying mice are guarded and it is illegal to kill, torture or disturb them or destroy the resting place.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish board member of the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help.
She said, "We have a lot to learn about our mice and many of our kind, we just don't know how it goes with them".
Ronaldo reiterates charges of embezzlement as prosecutors prepare to close German weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo has described accusations against him of embezzlement as "false news", and says that people "want to promote themselves" by using my name.
His prosecutors are preparing to shut down the German weekly Der Spiegel, which disclosed the debts.
The Portugal and Juventus defender is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is prepared to pay her $375,000 to keep the matter quiet, Der Spiegel reported on the day of the wedding.
In an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers, just hours after the charges were dismissed, Ronaldo, 33, said the stories were "false news".
No, no, no, no, no, no. This is not a joke.
What they said today, falsehood, said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner into the statue.
They are only trying to make a big deal out of my name.
It's common.
They want to be known by my name, but that's part of my job.
"My soul is happy and my soul is well", he added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are seeking to prosecute Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they have called "an unacceptable abuse of personal space", according to Reuters.
Prosecutor Christian Schultz said the actor was seeking compensation for "moral violations in a mass shooting" for the offense, which is possibly one of the most serious violations of personal freedom in recent years.
The incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the actress' bedroom, where he allegedly raped her, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her that he was 99% a good guy, but that that one percent had betrayed him.
Reports suggest that Ronaldo suspected that they had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also says that she went to the police and had pictures taken of her injuries in a hospital, but later found a solution outside of court because she felt terrified of fashionistas and was too concerned to be humiliated.
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to reverse the decision, as she is still traumatised by the so-called incident.
Ronaldo was due to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the scandal broke, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: Britain regrets losing its railway hubs
Britain will regret it forever if it loses its status as the world's top oil producer after Brexit, Trade Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was significant that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, they would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"We need an agreement", said Lord Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of market delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could be costly.
The Burnaston plant - which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My guess is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's head of Burnaston.
Other British carmakers have expressed fears of leaving the EU without any agreement on how trade will play out overnight, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says the Mini plant in Oxford will close within a month of Brexit.
The biggest fear is what carmakers say are disruptions in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's transport network is built on a just-in-time basis, with items arriving every 37 minutes from dealerships in both the UK and EU to chartered cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be unrest along the border, which activists say could lead to delays and shortages.
It would have been impossible for Toyota to have more than one daily supply at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production is halted.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU is "re-focused on preventing the explosion of the market".
"We need to get a deal. We want the best deal that allows, as I say, not just to enjoy the outcome now, but to take the opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, is that we have to be able to continue what has been a very successful food chain.
Toyota could not say how long production would stop, but with the future in mind, he warned that costs would decrease in the factory's competitiveness and therefore cost more.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is chairman of Unite, said his members are constantly upset. "From what I've experienced, I know that once these big guys go, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a clear and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House announces
A number of issues are at stake in Donald Trump's meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, which may now be postponed for another week as the battle over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, ties between Trump associates and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will run for the prosecutor's office or not, and thus jeopardize Mueller's reputation, has been debated in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had switched to wearing a decoy device to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this.
But on the last day of the month, he went to the White House, despite the fact that he was going to give a speech.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for the wedding day.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed due to a breakdown in the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed a Senate vote even further.
Trump's middle man, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenthal meeting, she said: "One day is not yet set, it may be this week, but I think it will be postponed for a week, because of everything that is happening in the Supreme Court.
but we will see it through. I would rather see it through as one who is invisible.
Some media have questioned the claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders replied that the belief in news conferences was not due to a dislike of the news people on television who were presenting, but she said, "I don't disagree with what they are actually doing".
She then explains that the interaction between Trump and the media will increase.
"The president is doing more S&S than any president before him", she said, without providing any evidence. "We wanted to hate the numbers".
Investigations are still coming, Sanders said, but since the media has the opportunity to ask the president questions directly, it's often better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, and you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks, and it's going to take the place of a department where you can talk to the president of the United States of America.
Trump regularly addresses questions when he leaves the White House or is part of open meetings or press conferences with visiting officials.
Having news meetings alone is self-evident.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why when he appeared unabashedly and strangely in front of a gathering of reporters.
Health minister writes to EU NHS Scotland staff after Brexit fears
The Secretary of State for Health has written to EU staff working in the NHS in Scotland to express their country's gratitude and hope they will stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter, with less than six months to go before Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to cover the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens working in the public sector.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "Discussions between the UK and the EU to leave are ongoing, and decisions are expected in the fall.
However, the UK government has also been wary of any preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know that these are trying times for you.
I will pay back to each one what he has done, regardless of the outcome.
Employees across the EU, and beyond, bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health transition, and are ongoing for patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie Is For Emergency Surgery After Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercbrombie has undergone a knee surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, host Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half.
"He went out on the sideline and just collapsed there", Reed said.
Friends and doctors gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before lifting him to a farm and taking him out for further tests.
An employee of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was being treated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are still some reports of the type/size of damage and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year redshirt, is playing his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before he had to retire from the game, which brings the total to 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers are subject to higher poll taxes when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged a higher poll tax when they buy a property in the UK, and the proceeds are used to help the homeless under the new dry scheme
The change will undermine Corbyn's ability to attract young voters.
The blockage of the poll tax is being imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers are expected to be charged higher poll taxes when they buy a property in the UK, with the proceeds going to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn by attracting younger voters with promises of more affordable housing and higher wages.
The cap on the poll tax will be imposed on individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional revenue will boost the government's efforts to combat insomnia.
The single-unit fee - which is in addition to the current stamp fee, taking into account the elderly who arrived two years ago at house number two and buy-to-let - can be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects the change to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new homes in London are bought by non-British residents, which drives up prices and makes it worse for first-time buyers to get a foot in the door.
Many of the country's most populous areas - especially the capital - have become ghost towns, as so many foreign buyers spend their time abroad
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the poll tax to help young people buy their first home.
He charged large construction projects to keep prices high by buying land without using it, and called on Mrs May to get rid of quotas on affluent homes to understand the housing market in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of proposed housing reforms, including a new rental department and an end to evictions for no reason.
He also wants to give the municipality more power to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would devote my prime ministership to reviving the British dream - to making life better for every generation.
And that means understanding the broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be fair that it is as easy for non-UK residents, as well as foreign companies, to buy a house as it is for aspiring British citizens.
For too many, the dream of owning a home is far from being realized, and the loss of a deep sleep is becoming more and more real.
Jack Ross: My highest priority is to coach Scotland
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "highest priority" is to manage Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish international takes on the challenge of rebuilding the North East side, who are currently third in League One, three points from the relegation zone.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season
I wanted to represent my country as a scout.
I got a B match and that was it", Ross told BBC Radio's Sportsound.
But growing up, I often visited Scotland in Hampden with my father and it just drove me backwards.
Surely I have an opportunity to be a good servant.
Ross's Sunderland team currently includes Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager said he was not afraid of such names in such a big club, and has previously denied any links with Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
My current success will be judged by whether I can get this club back in the Premier League.
The structure and the conditions of the club make it definitely fit in the Premier League, he said.
If I am not already present, I hope to be with you again.
Ross has only been head coach for three years, after a spell as assistant coach at Dumbarton and part of the Hearts team for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa to come back from relegation to the third tier, and converted St Mirren to fight for relegation to become champions the following season.
And Ross says he feels better fit than he ever did in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He was a hard man to cross, as he walked along the road to the temple of Elohim.
But I still didn't think it was worth it to me to be a slave.
It sounds like a lie, because I did well, I was able to make a living from it, and I had some big gigs.
But it can be hard to play.
You're going to go through a lot week after week.
I still go through it, considering the rigidity and pressure of the work, but the direction just feels right.
I always wanted to be a coach, and now I feel like this is the best thing I've ever done in my adult life.

The summer heat wave has boosted the incomes of struggling pubs in the UK, but put even more pressure on restaurants
Pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in July - but restaurant revenues fell 4.8 percent, figures show.
Peter Martin, from the CGA trade advisory group that calculated the figures, said: "The continued sunshine and longer than expected England's participation in the World Cup meant that July followed the same pattern as June, when hotel revenues rose by 2.8 percent, but restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8 percent in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
Taverns and bars, which mostly sell liquor, performed much better and, by comparison, their profits were greater than those of restaurants.
The hostesses, who mostly sell food, also suffered in the sun, although not as badly as the owners of the restaurant.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In addition to inns and bars, sales of beverages rose 6.6 percent that month, and food dropped 3 percent.
Paul Newman, from leisure and hospitality industry, RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since last April.
Weather and the impact of major social and sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the outside world.
It's no surprise that grocery stores continue to struggle, even though a decline in sales of 4.8 percent year over year will be very painful on top of ongoing cost concerns.
The long, hot summers could not have come at a worse time for food markets and time will tell if the more moderate August heat will bring the needed air space.
The overall growth in sales of pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating the declining growth of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry, collects and analyses data from 47 partner organisations, with a combined turnover of £9 billion, and is the industry's focal point.
One in five children have hidden social media accounts that they share with their parents
One in five children - some under 11 - have hidden social media accounts that they share with their parents and teachers, a survey reveals
A survey of 20,000 high school students
This news has increased fears that sexual content will be torn apart
Twenty percent of the students said they had a headband that they showed to their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create social media accounts that they pass on to adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a significant increase in the number of Instagram users - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
This news has increased fears that sexual content will be torn apart.
Twenty percent of the students said they use a smart headset that they show their parents while having private use.
A mother who came up to the private parts of her 13-year-old daughter found a toothpick asking others to rape me.
The study, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of free schools, showed that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 have two users, with half of them admitting to having private users.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said, "It's disturbing that so many teens are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle becomes the Sportsman's Speaker of the Scottish Athletics Committee.
Eilidh Doyle is elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of the board.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in freestyle wrestling and its president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to use her vast experience at the international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, British and international community of free sport and we are confident that free sport in Scotland will benefit greatly from her inclusion", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm excited to be acting as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can really give back and help sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, along with four Olympic gold medals and is now a regular commentator on the BBC, is no longer able to walk after suffering a brain hemorrhage.
He tweeted: "One month ago today, I had a brain hemorrhage.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or how well.
I have been hard at work, but I have regained my senses. I have learned to walk, and now I am trained as a blacksmith.
Thank you for the encouraging message!
The description of a breast pump compares mothers to cows and opinions vary on the internet
A breast pump operation has sparked controversy online with a description comparing breastfeeding mothers to dairy cows.
As a pre-launch sign of what is being touted as the world's first soundless breast pump that is safe to use, consumer technology company Elvie released a sparkling lighting design that resembles a visual tapes to showcase the freedom the new pump offers to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a courtyard with a cow in one piece, one of which says, "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any meat".
The end goes on: "Pump it, pump it, I give these pigs, pump it, pump it, I milk my goats".
However, the description posted on the company's Facebook page has caused a stir online.
With over 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the film has received mixed reviews from critics, with many saying it does too little to address the concerns of the dairy industry.
"It's a bad idea to use a cow to promote this product.
They must be kept on the road to get milk, so that their young ones will not be weaned from birth.
Elvie breast pump fits in a breast holder while still (Elvie/Mother)
"He divides the mother and the child", another said.
But yes, why not use them to light a breast pump for mothers who can't have their babies?
"I see a light on the horizon, " another replied.
Others called the lights, and a woman admitted that she thought the singing was rude.
I think this is a very good idea.
I would have had one if I was still breastfeeding.
That pump made me feel exactly like a squeeze.
The light is a little bit off, but I took it for what it was.
This is a very good product", one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun story for mothers who pump (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like cows".
It is not a lamp that glows or condemns the kingdom of milk.
Finally, the group of women reveal that they have danced with still pumps tucked into their breastplates.
The concept behind the program is based on the notion that many women who breast-pump say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is a simple pump, has no pipes or tubes, and fits securely into a breastplate, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go outside while being pumped.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and creative director of Mother, commented: "Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product that has managed to get off to a rocky and challenging start.
By making a comparison between women giving and cows, we wanted to bring the breast pump and all its challenges to life, while presenting it in an entertaining way that women can connect to, and show the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump brings.
This is not the first time that Elvie Pump has been on the cover.

Hundreds of refugee children move to a tenth of a mile from the Texas market
The number of refugee children returned has increased, although the monthly number of crossings remains relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration have made it harder to sponsor children.
Historically, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and have sought to jeopardize their own ability to remain in the country by arriving and adopting a child.
The waters rose in June when Commonwealth authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would be required to provide fingerprints and that the information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested countless individuals who sought to sponsor lone wolves.
The Bureau later estimated that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or members of a sponsor's household are here illegally and a large proportion of them are punished foreigners.
Therefore, we continue to pursue the individuals", said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to take care of the children faster, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their return, rather than the 60 days previously required, according to shelter workers.
Many will attend a conference call rather than appear in person to defend their rights to legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not deemed worthy of assistance will soon be expelled from the country.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become fearful or mentally ill, which can lead to horrific loss or attempts to escape, according to the shelter workers and the report, which has been leaked from the system in recent months.
Prosecutors say that fear of these things is heightened in a large area, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child struggling are more likely to be felt, because of the noise.
They also said that moving children to tent cities without enough time to prepare them emotionally, or allowing them to say goodbye to friends, can make the soullessness that many already struggle with worse.
Syria calls for the immediate withdrawal of American, French and Turkish rebel forces.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, speaking at the General Assembly of the United Nations, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign troops were on Syrian soil illegally on the grounds that they were fighting against aggression and that they would be treated with dignity.
"Get them out of the country without any conditions", he ordered.
Moualem insisted that the war on terrorism is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been displaced.
He said that Damascus would continue to fight this holy battle until all the land of Syria was cleansed of both rebel groups and any illegal, foreign entity.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were good enough for them to return, and he blamed some Western countries for instilling unjustified fear that influences refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and aid agencies to make these returns easier", he said.
They make up stories that should be purely human political problems.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomats in the Middle East say a new agreement between Russia and Turkey to make a field area in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement halted a massive influx of Russian-backed Syrian troops into the country of three million people.
Moualem, on the other hand, pointed out that the agreement had "significant challenges" and expressed hopes that military action would be taken against jihadists as well as fighters from the Nusra Front, which has been linked to Al-Qaeda, which would be "destroyed".
The envoy of the ST, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon be able to convene the first meetings of a new commission composed of government and opposition members, to create a post-war order for Syria and prepare for elections.
Moualem placed conditions on the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the group's work should be limited to evaluating the points of the current system,[7] and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a New Deal
By all accounts, Mr. Trump will win reelection in 2020, although many liberals are hopeful that charges of treason and insanity will end his presidency prematurely.
Which is without a doubt the most exciting presidential end ever!
There are now no signs of a breakdown.
Since 2014, the number of prime time shows has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show tops television ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news outlets.
"This is like a fire that people are drawn to because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, who hosts the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a bomb destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has a different theory.
She recalls a rental car trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because he's going to make me run", Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in the red.
Of course, like nothing else on television, the move from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the reunification of immigrant families and the health of the global economy.
To extinguish is a lot of work, which only the most careful minds can do.
And in short, you're more than an informed citizen when you take a six-hour look at a panel of experts questioning Bob Woodward's use of deep background sources for his book, Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich jacket (a garment full of humor, The Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's obscene comments about, um, Mr. Trump's building.
I'm going to watch Super Mario, which I used to like.
"Part of what he does that makes it resemble reality TV is that he gives you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, "about the changing cast and the daily twists of the story (choosing to fight the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un)".
You can't get past one, you're out again.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny and 80 degrees outside his home on the North Shore of Kauai, but he was indoors watching MSNBC while he was taping CNN.
He couldn't look away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was standing up for the Senate judiciary and the future of the Supreme Court was on the line.
I remember when we were all hacking at the broadcasts in the afternoon, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought they were acting in a foolish way, but they turned out to be right.

Money from outside the country pouring into a tight middle-class election
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania case sees a surge in money, as a reversal of a congressional ruling ended up with two officials vying for the same seat.
In this recently redrawn Pittsburgh suburb, Democratic Representative Conor Lamb is running -- having won his seat in a second instance in a special election last year.
Lamb is running against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which is particularly affected by the new 17th district.
However, the charters were re-issued after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old rules were inconsistent with the government and in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th Congress has started a financial battle between the major party's financing, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning a landslide victory in a special election in March for the highly anticipated 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the case by 20 points.
Political analysts expect Democrats to have the difference.
The United States agreed to punish El Salvador for its support to China, but withdrew
Officials were wary that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a successful meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in July 2017 and stayed at a Panama hotel before the owners threw out the leadership of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials chose to recall U.S. leaders in diplomatic exile from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in response to the new decision to no longer recognize Taiwan, said Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the council, in a statement earlier this month.
However, the sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which is believed to have received $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for surveillance of Russian weapons, education and financial aid.
The sanctions, which included cuts in aid and restrictions on immigration, would have been disastrous for the Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference to discuss security and economic progress, following a similar meeting last year intended to be a step forward in efforts to prevent migrant workers from entering the United States.
However, in mid-September officials at the highest levels of the administration made clear that they wanted the conference to proceed and thus ended sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the summit, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the order places on the summit, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new, harsh instructions or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Lord Bolton declined to comment on the details of the jacking of the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to consult on internal matters without naming them.
Their statements were confirmed by an anonymous scholar who is close to the promissory note.
Read the story
Next, which cannot be ignored is the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, which now has very strong evidence on the national scene.
It is said that Mr. Mueller is turning his investigation to whether Mr. Trump's election campaign had anything to do with Russia interfering with our election.
Should Congress pass into other hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable in the Senate, as he prepares to return to the electorate, and possibly a judicial panel of his peers.
There is much more, and I do not think it is a matter of hastening it, that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable, as is his counterpart in Europe.
Decisions will be made by everyone on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of the war.
In 1938, German troops were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if the West would oppose him and support Czechoslovak forces in Munich.
We failed and we didn't take the opportunity to escape the years of bloodshed that followed.
The story of such a turn is fast, and the impatience of the people is going to be sooner or later.
Americans are experiencing many of these turning points right now.
What if Mr. Trump brings home the state's attorney, Rod Rosenstein, the man who led the investigation into Mr. Mueller's death?
Rosenstein has been in a bit of a pickle since this newspaper reported that he had secretly considered running for president last year and had speculated that he was unfit for the office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times story is untrue.
"How do we respond if the recent FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or complete -- or if he is referred to the Supreme Court, despite the credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?"
And above all, are we going to the midterm elections to vote for a Congress that will give Mr. Trump responsibility?
If we fail these tests, the winter of the nation will be long.
But from what I learned in Prague, I don't expect us to fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, and she was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government that had once occupied my mission.
She survived, she moved to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light a Sabbath candle on her front desk that had a swastika.
If this is my inheritance, how can I not be safe about our future?

Graham Dorrans at Rangers, optimistic before Rapid Vienna
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Sunday, knowing that a win over Austria, following a successful draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a good position to advance from Group B of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he expects Rangers to use that result as a springboard to something bigger.
"It was a good step for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
But since we have faith, we go on with a straight path.
We might have been able to reach the end, but if we had been able to reach the end, it would have been better to reach an equal end.
They were a little better in the first half and we came out in the second half and we were the better team.
Now the wedding day is going to be another big, European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough race because they got a good result in their last race, but with the spectators in the back, I'm sure we can run and get a good result.
It's been a really tough year, with all the injuries and the changes in the organization, but now it's a really good environment here.
The team is good and the guys are really enjoying it; the exercise is good.
Hopefully we can now run, put the last race back and get a good result.
Women lose sleep for fear of retaliation
Although participants in a survey were clear about what cigarettes they wanted, few talked to their family about it.
About half of the Nationwide survey respondents said they talked to their spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the initiative to have the conversation", said Holly Snyder, chief life insurance officer at Nationwide.
This is how it should start.
Be firm with your wife and children: You cannot provide for your family if you do not make your wishes known in good time.
Together with your counselor and your family, you can decide where and how you want to smoke, as those choices can be very costly.
Get your financial advisor on board. Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the expenses.
Your financial options for long-term care may include a standard long-term farm insurance, a blended life insurance with a repayment value to help pay for these expenses, or insurance with your own money - if you have it.
Remove your legal documents: Avoid a legal fight.
Get a health professional on site so you can appoint someone you trust to oversee your medical care and ensure that staff follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the power of a prosecutor to your financial case.
You would choose someone you trust to take care of your financial decisions and make sure your accounts are balanced if you are unable to do so.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a health emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Have you finished answering questions about drug addiction and overindulgence?

Man fired several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle as he was leaving his home in the city.
The victim, in the fjords, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at around 02:30 BST, as an accidental act.
The victim did not see his victim.
The injuries he sustained are not life-threatening and police have called witnesses.
Earthquakes and floods in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With ineffective communication, rescue workers have received no information from the Donggala government, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the quake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Paul, more than sixteen thousand people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawest:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located on the edge of a narrow valley on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was fortified on the 40th day of the festival when the earthquake and the flood struck.
Donggala is a district that stretches over more than 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in an outcrop on the island of Sulawesi.
The administrative unit of the district is the town of Stabro, which has a population of 299,200 as of 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main products of the economy of the landlocked part of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the country, but it is most concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have frequently experienced severe flooding in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the Western Ghats in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Seismic Ring and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and floods in recent times:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian island of Aceh, in North Sumatra, on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed more than 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Several hundred died on Nias Island, just off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that erupted on the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hits one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, causing a massive 10-meter flood that destroyed countless villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A major earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing devastation and fear as people are reminded of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No flood survivors were seen during this trip, but over 100 people died from the collapsed buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily stranded thousands of visitors.
Sarah Palin's eldest son handled with harshness charges at home
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, is arrested on charges of harassment.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, disturbing a report and resisting arrest, according to an Alaska State Troopers report Saturday.
According to the police report, a female acquaintance was trying to call the police and report the so-called crime when he took away her phone.
Palin is being held in custody at the Mat-Su detention centre and the bail without security is $500, the KTUU said.
On the Sabbath, while sitting on the judge's bench, Paul, who was a man of great wisdom, began to speak.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means he faces up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that serious charges have been brought against Paul.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the incident.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering in domestic violence reports, and possession of a weapon in connection with the incident.
His wife said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was discovered by a group of veterans in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD, which had come from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near Central Sulawesi, a peninsula north of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Footage of the protest is circulating on social media.
The city of Paul was inundated with waves, and about a hundred people gathered at the temple.
Commonwealth activists want the same death penalty for anyone convicted of assault in New York City.
New York Republican activists are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of a New York City assault case that left eight people dead -- a death sentence that has not been carried out in the state for a crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to hit a sugar bar on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he hit pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
To justify a death sentence, the prosecution must prove that Saipov "willfully" killed eight victims and "willfully" caused serious injury, according to the death penalty application filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges were punishable by death.
Weeks after the incident, an investigative committee indicted Saipov on 22 charges, including eight counts of manslaughter by gross negligence, commonly used by Commonwealth forces in organized crime trials, as well as one count of aggravated assault and battery.
The attack required a well-constructed plan and planning, prosecutors said, describing Saipov's manner as heinous, merciless and immoral.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov committed rape, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the report.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been 10 years since the Southern District of New York last had a trial on the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of killing two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was abolished in a New York court case was in 1953, for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court records.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he made the raid after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the prosecution.
He also asked to fly the ISIS flag in the hospital's emergency room, police said.
He pleads not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's designated bodyguards, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting the guilty plea for life in prison without the possibility of parole, will have a negative impact on everyone", Patton said.
Saipov's defense had already asked the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MPs say Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised that a few of the people here would help him during a protest at the drought conference today.
The UKIP leader had previously said that politicians should "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics - after one of Theresa May's members suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would no longer be involved if Mr Farage was Brexit minister.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in uniting the two groups has been raised by Remain Conservatives who were at another Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep her Chequers plan on track, amid persecution from Brexiters, those who want to stay, and the EU.
Conservatives insist she is trying to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition - forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and chaos.
Mr Bone said at Leave Means Leave the Solihull station that he wanted to block Chequers away.
He arranged for Lord Farage to become a member and be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
If he had not been in the house, we would not be here.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I support Brexit, but we have to block Chequers".
Of his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be important.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone pointed out that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and prefer to remain is completely untrue".
Tory Brexit leader Andre Jenkins was also at the rally and told the media: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers are not popular with the crowd, the opposition will not vote, it is not popular with our party and our independents, who really walk the streets and take over our power.
Get that leg up and let Chequers go and start listening.
In a direct order to Mrs. May, she added: "Presidents keep their majesty when they keep their promise".
Mr Farage said at the conference that politicians must "feel the heat" if they are to cheat the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political parties", he said.
They're trying to fake Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we're not going to let you get away with it.
In a message to the fiery crowd, he looked up: "I want you to make the political parties, which are not far from betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
We're going to get the people of this country who gave us a victory in Brexit to help us, and we're not going to stop until we're an independent, self-governing, sovereign United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, those who wanted to stay marched through Birmingham before meeting for two hours in the city centre.
A small number of volunteers signed the Tories Against Brexit petition after the group was formed this weekend.
The Labour leader, Lord Adonis, angered the Conservatives with his security concerns that arose when the conference began.
"These are people who tell us that they understand the ICT systems and all the support from Canada etc, that there are no problems with the border, with free trade without barriers in Ireland", he added.
It is completely laudable.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he pointed out.
Warren will consider whether to run for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future at the Massachusetts State House in the western part of the state on Saturday.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican nominee Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's campaign manager in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the focus of speculation as to whether she will run against Trump in 2020.
The event, held late Saturday in Holyoke, was her 36th meeting with voters in the House since Trump took office.
A participant asked if she was going to run.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington and understand the failure of government and that means women in high places.
The investigation into the shooting of LSU's Sims.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the shooting of LSU curveball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They had sent out a video clip of the shooting on Friday to help make out who was on the set.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died as a result", police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde came up to help his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene, with a weapon, and also admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested in connection with the incident and detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 6-foot-6 sophomore who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games, 10 of them starts, last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix Lewis Hamilton approaches world record after team bids give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear when Valtteri Bottas drove ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team bids would play a big part in the race.
From the lead, Bottan had a good start and would have jeopardised Hamilton when he tried to defend his position in the first two corners and allowed Vettel to run over his teammate.
Vettel took the first emergency step and let Hamilton steer into the journey slowly in the chain, something that was to be decisive.
Mercedes stopped in the next lap and came out again behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back after a few crashes, which ended with the Ferrari driver's three having to keep open inside after a double-double move to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the start line far behind and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He was then ahead for much of the race and the wheels held when he overtook Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place with a quick finish.
He went on the block on lap 44, but failed to extend the journey on the final eight laps, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real honorable man and promised me a front.
The team has worked exceptionally well to get to number one and two", said Hamilton.
This was a very stupid body.
President Donald Trump angered Senator Dianne Feinstein on a routine Saturday with her threat to withhold a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In his speech to a West Virginia assembly, he did not directly quote Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead noted that what was going on in the Senate proved that people were evil and unclean and unholy.
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last days of the Senate is that you will see wrath, you will see people who are evil, wicked, unclean and insensitive", he said.
When you look at the spending and the games and they say, "Oh, it wasn't me".
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, was that you painting?
Remember her answer... you were the one who painted the paper -- oh, oh, what?
Oh, no. I was just...
I did not lay a hand on you.
Okay, wait a minute.
We locked... No, we didn't lock, he added and surrounded the senator.
Feinstein received the letter, which detailed Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, in late July and was released in early September - but Feinstein denies that the letter came from her department.
"I didn't cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't cover up her story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.

Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for their Elite League defeat on Friday to Belfast Giants, winning their second game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took a quick two-point lead with strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the game before Dwyer sent the Giants back to the field.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee, before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who came back from 2-1 down to defeat Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth time the teams had met this season, and the Giants had won the last three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with a field goal from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford had the field goal when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
A lot happened in the first half and Sullivan got the home team back in the game at 13:19 before Matt Marquardt made the point to tie Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants took the lead before the first period when he scored his final goal of the evening late in the first period.
The home team came back and Bouchard equalised once more with a goal, when they had a man in charge, at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran played well together as Nielsen gave Dundee the lead for the first time in the game late in the second period, and he secured the win with the team's fifth goal of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are at home in their next game on Friday against Milton Keynes.
Pilot dies to ensure hundreds of people on board survive earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia is being honored posthumously for his role in ensuring the safe departure of a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 8++ people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake in Sulawesi on Friday, which caused a tsunami.
The earthquake continued to strike the area, and many were trapped in the walls of the city of Paul.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his seat in a swinging control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the flight path, got off safely.
He ran from the watchtower, thinking that he was going to fall.
He died later in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We arranged for a mule from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another town.
The next day we started out before the storm and sailed for the city.
At this our hearts are not broken".
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands after the country's water crisis agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was restricted.
"The number is said to be increasing because many were under house arrest and many are not being contacted", said the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
A storm of up to 20 feet (6 meters) has destroyed Paul, who will have a funeral procession on Sunday.
The army and passenger aircraft come with help and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "The ambulance is bringing bodies every minute.
Clean water is natural.
Small traders are robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is helping with the full journey, but we don't know what we can do.
This is a beginning of sorrow, but it can be a greater sorrow than this.
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, visited Palu on Sunday and told the people of this country: "I would like to ask each and every one of you to work day and night to implement the evacuation orders.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok, killing more than 500 people.
Air New Guinea says one person is missing after a plane crash in a polli
The airline that operates a plane that crashed into a Pacific pole in Micronesia now says one person is missing after saying all 47 passengers and crew were safely rescued from the sinking aircraft.
On the following Saturday, a man was walking, but they did not find him.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond, so they asked the passengers about their age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane ran aground while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline announced that six passengers were in hospital on Saturday and that all were in good condition.
The cause of the crash and the emergency circumstances are unclear.
The Air Force and the U.S. Air Force have reported that the aircraft landed in Poland near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had gone off the cliff.
The American traveler, Bill Jaynes, said that the plane was flying extremely low.
"That's a really good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to swim through the water that rose in the middle to the emergency doors of the sinking ship.
He said the flies had split apart and screamed, and that he had a slight injury to his skin.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working to bend a nearby pier also helped to use rubber dinghies to move people ashore before the plane sank to about 100 feet (30 m) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in crashes involving PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but none involving Air Niugini.
It was about the time of evening when she was burned alive.
The accused made his evidence Saturday in the opening session of the trial of a man accused of burning a woman to death in Mississippi in 2014.
The American court reporter, Paul Rowlett, served as a court reporter for several hours on the subject of fraud.
He briefly described how he used a phone record to confirm the walk of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location information from several phones that suggested Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, thus contradicting his previous preference, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When information indicated that Chambers had his phone, when she was said to have been with her friend, Michael Sanford, the police began to question Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness stand on Saturday and reported that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was unemployed because my truck was in Nashville.
Another theory is that Tellis had said that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Charlotte's death, Chambers deleted messages, calls, and information from her phone.
"He cut her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense starts as planned on their final practice on Sunday.
The judge announced that he expected the court to hold a hearing later that day.

Another black people?!
NEW child agent names couple for driving her behind racist orders
A New York child protection agent sues a couple for discrimination and driving her after receiving a surprise text message from her mother, who complained that she was still a black person.
Parik denies that they are racist, and compares the case to a penny crush.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was shocked to discover that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was pregnant when she showed up for her first day in 2016.
"Never a black person", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending the messages to her husband, she sent them to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
When she caught the brother, the disgraced Plasco-Flaxman called Mrs. Maurice and said that the child agent before her, who was African American, had not done a good job and she instead expected a philippine, according to the New York Post.
Mr. Maurice got paid for his day's work and then was sent home by Uber.
Mr. Maurice demands the pair be compensated for the request, including a compensation equivalent to $350 a day for six months and living in the place the job had originally offered, although there was no agreement.
I want to show them, see here, that they don't do that kind of thing", she told the Post on Friday, adding that she knew this was discrimination.
The couple have responded to accusations of racism again, saying that the search for Maurice was the wise thing to do because they did not know if they could trust her after making her fifty.
My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people", the husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
But would you leave your child with someone you were close to, even if it was surprising?
Your newborn child?
Come on now.
On the comparison of the case to the penny crush, Plasco said that his wife was due two months later and that she was in a much worse condition.
"Do you have anything on your hands?"
It's not a bad thing to do", the investor said.
As the trial progressed, the public was quick to accuse the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and differences.
The publisher of Paddington feared that readers would not associate with a talking bear, uncovering new letters.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book's acceptance, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It's funny now that we know what we know about Paddington's reception.
She said that her father, who had worked as a BBC illustrator before being inspired to write the children's book by a small toy, would have been optimistic if his work was rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication was a good feeling in the face of grief over his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as an important member of our family, she added that her father was ultimately the result of the good reception he received.
"He was a peaceful man, " she said", and no one hurt him".
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like you were watching your child, but it wasn't really about anything you had done.
I think he thought of Paddington that way.
Although he created it and it was his idea, he always insisted on giving Paddington himself the credit.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, the daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors for appendicitis tried to save her.
"She called regularly to say she was not happy that she was not expected to finish", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Nad called and said that she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, Tashi, I love you so much, dear.
We'll be together again soon.
I will come soon.
The medicine that the doctors had given her to stop her heartbeat, was tied up and was out of order.
She had died a few days before and this was all over.
I had to sit there and wait, and I knew exactly what was happening.
I couldn't cry, write, or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I just had to hold it in.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers - not caring what she was going through.
"No one knows", she replied.
I lowered my head and cried constantly.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt a strong sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
A grieving mother puts up a suicide prevention card on a bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up maps of a Welsh bridge with thought-provoking messages and telephone numbers for people to call for help.
Tyler, son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he developed a bout of epilepsy and committed suicide at 18.
I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day, she said.
Father Davis, 45, of Lydney, said her son was a gifted cook with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew his smile.
They say his smile lit up some room.
But he worked hard until he died, because he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, 11-year-old Tyler committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I always worry that it's going to have its own aftermath".
Mr. Davis created the card to let people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't be in a hurry - you must speak.
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been a friend of Mrs. Davies for several years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
He said nothing about being sick or in any kind of pain.
A few days before Christmas, he began to behave unusually.
When he came to the place where the Passover lambs were laid, he opened the bags and found nothing.
She said that his death was a great shock to them, but they had to find out together. This terrified the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must continue and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in jeopardy as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought if we really got what he asked for - an investigation with limited time and space - then maybe we could get some consensus", Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee would break up into fundamental, partisan nodes.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigating?
Their objections are only because of the situation.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, on November 6 - and if, as expected, Republicans do poorly, they will weaken dramatically in their bid to win her husband's seat on the nation's highest court.
George W. Bush has been calling around to senators, trying to get them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and through him he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens behind the FBI report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still uncertain whether Mr. Kavanaugh can secure at least 50 Senate votes to allow Vice President Mike Pence to nominate him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors minkar under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Unification Council of South Korea, said there were 1,127 dropouts last year - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher smuggling fees were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented.
Most North Korean defectors eventually obtained South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee to China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is therefore easier to cross than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still in war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for a meeting to discuss escalating disarmament talks.
This followed the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they collectively agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. operation for nothing happening since then.
"Without trust in the United States, our national security will not be trusted, and under such circumstances it is not enough for us to disarm first", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "unfit" and says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Leader of the Opposition Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "unfit" and said he was "unfit" to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made her remarks during a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if there was a woman who had been able to do it, they would have said stupid", Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the wedding day.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his first story, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming or fighting with tears when talking about his family and his high school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democratic members of the committee, calling the charges against him "grotesque and organized character assassination" by the liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the election in 2016.
Pelosi said she felt Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because she knew he was biased.
I think he threw himself through the hatred and the way he went after Clinton and the Democrats.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would impeach Kavanaugh, if he would be impeached, and if Democrats would have a majority in the House of Representatives.
"One thing I can say -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit, not just for the Supreme Court, but for the court that he's in now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his trial, he avoided questions about whether he would overturn the high court's rulings.
"This is not the time to have a stupid, biased person go to court and expect us to say that it's not all good", Pelosi said.
And a woman should wear it.
A rightful right is lost, months and years pass away, and she cannot express it without weeping.
"We cry when we are sick", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?
"I was greatly comforted by a certain woman, a housekeeper, who said that she too was weeping when she was in pain.
I'm not well.
And so she just stayed.
And I thought that was great.
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are fundamentally wrong.
One of my clearest memories is from a job I had in a male-dominated office, where I once started to cry because I was so bad, when I was grabbed by the neck by an older woman -- an Isabella priest who I had always been a little afraid of -- who pushed me into a hallway.
"You will have to weep for ten years", she told me.
They don't think you're in the desert.
They think you are afraid, and they are full, because they have done it.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having extramarital sex on board a boat called the Monkey Business and subsequently retired, Mrs. Schroeder, who was very unhappy, thought there was no reason why she should not try to run for president herself.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision", she told me, teasing me 30 years later.
And there were seven others, and they wanted the last one to be a bride.
Then a voice from heaven shouted, "Snow white and seven thunders".
Because it was so late in the election campaign, she went back out of the money-making business and vowed that she would not quit until she had collected the two million dollars.
It was a losing battle.
She warned that some of her donors who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a message?" she thought.
When she made her speech and announced that she would not run a regular election campaign, the emotions were overwhelming - gratitude for the people who supported her, disappointment in the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than legislators, and anger at sexism - and she cried.
"You may think I had a nervous breakdown", said Mrs. Schroeder, recalling the media reaction.
You might have thought that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my tombstone?
Is she crying?
How the ISA-China trade war was good for Beijing
The first signs of the US-China trade war are alarming, and while the battle is far from over, a dispute between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing, with the future in mind, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year when he imposed tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
Most importantly, this week came tariffs affecting goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion) and effectively imposing tariffs on half of the goods imported into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time, most recently by slashing tariffs on US goods by five to 10 percent, worth $60 billion.
China is committed to competing with the United States head-on, and the world's second largest economy is not going to stop anytime soon.
Getting Washington to stop would mean giving in, but giving in to the US would be too much of a snob for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
In short, experts say that if Beijing does everything right, the trade war with the United States could help China in the future by lowering tariffs on both economies' exports.
"That a hasty policy move, either in Washington or Beijing, could cause the economies of the other countries to collapse is indeed much more problematic than previously thought", said Abigail Grace, an assistant research fellow in Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank
Syria is ready to take back refugees, says foreign minister
Syria has announced that they are ready for the voluntary return of refugees and are calling for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
At the United Nations General Assembly, the foreign minister, Walid al-Moualem, said that the situation in the country was improving.
Today, the situation in the region is more stable and secure due to the progress in combating violence, he said.
The government continues to rebuild the lands devastated by the rebels to restore normalcy.
Everything is now ready to receive the refugees in the country, who were forced to leave because of the violence and lonely economy that governed their daily activities and livelihood.
The ST estimates that more than 5.5 million refugees have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
The six million people who are left in the country need help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government was ready to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he noted that she would not accept help from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup with a victory over Team USA, who finished 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling most of the tournament, hit his first on the 16th hole, with a par 3, right in the water, and lost his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all of his rounds, becoming one of only four players to achieve a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was hit by a pitch when he lost 5%4 to the European player who was second on the podium, Thorbjorn Olsen of Denmark.
The world's number one on the doubles rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who was likely playing his last Ryder Cup.
The eight-time Ryder Cup champion, Sergio Garcia of Spain, became the most successful European ever to win the tournament, with 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but today I couldn't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm grateful that Thomas chose me and put his trust in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have you back.
It's about the team, and I'm happy to be able to help", said a local Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the candle on to his compatriot, John Ram, who beat American golf hero Tiger Woods, 2&1, in singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, growing up I looked up to him", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and his Ryder Cup record is now 13-21-3.
The lowest of any player to win 14 major championships, only Jack Nicklaus has won more.
Team USA struggled to blend in all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf at a high level throughout the tournament.
American team captain Jim Furyk said after the team's disappointment, "I'm proud of these four, they fought.
It was the hours this morning when we made it hard for Europe.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a loose team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're coming back, I'm going to partner with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going to move on.
I love these 12 fours and I'm excited to be team captain.
A rose where a rose is born.
They were weaker than we were.
