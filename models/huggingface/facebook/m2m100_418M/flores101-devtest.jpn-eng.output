This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had wings, but also provides detailed points, such as color and stereo layout, which are generally not in fossils.
According to the scientists, the animal's wings were black on the outside and hot on the inside.
This discovery was also a clue to the evolution of bird flies.
Although the dinosaur wings do not have a sufficiently developed axis called the wings axis, since there are cotton wings and small wings, which are the characteristics of other wings, the researchers guess that the wings are more likely to have evolved later than these other characteristics.
From the structure of the flags, it is estimated that it was used not for the purposes of flight, but for body temperature regulation and visual effects. The researchers suggested that although this is a young dinosaur's hole, the samples showed adult flags and not hyyoko's flags.
The researchers suggest that even though this sample is a young dinosaur's backbone, it is created by adult wings rather than wings.

She is detained until the prosecution and trial, but her photos are widely published and the witnesses may be damaged.
This is commonly done in other regions of the UK, but the judicial system in Scotland is different, and the courts consider the publication of photos to be potentially negative.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from Dundee University says, “Reporters who publish photos of suspects and others are going through a danger bridge.”
The Criminal Department of the Crown Court, which is fully responsible for the charges, shows the intention of not to comment on the press group at least until they are charged.

According to a survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal elections, the number of people opposed the Republicanization in Australia increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued that in the 2010 federal election campaign, when Queen Elizabeth II's rule ended, Australia should move to a republic.
According to a survey, 34% of people agree with this opinion and hope that Queen Elizabeth II will be the last monarch of Australia.
A survey found that 29% of those who thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible and 31% of those who thought it should not become a republic were both extreme.

The comet may be a source of water to the Earth, which forms proteins and carries organic substances that support life.
Scientists want to understand how the planets were formed, especially how the Earth was formed, since a long time the comet collided with the Earth.
Quomo, 53 years old, signed a law on legalizing gay marriages earlier this year.
He called this rumor “political talk and stupidity.”
It is speculated that it will be in the presidential election in 2016.
NextGen claims that the FAA is a system that allows aircraft to fly on short-distance routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
Traditional ground radar technology adopts contrary satellite technology, allowing controllers to identify aircraft more accurately and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There are no special transportation facilities installed, ground trains do not stop in Wembley, and there are no parking spaces or parks on the ground.
Fear of no means of transport has raised the possibility that the supporters of the team will be forced to play in a closed place.
A study published on Thursday in the academic magazine Science that a new species of birds was born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from the University of Princeton in the U.S. and Upsala University in Sweden that this new species evolved in just two generations, but the process was thought to take longer because it was a mixed reproduction of the indigenous species of Galapagos Finch and the transplanted species of Osaboten Finch.
Gold is a metal that can be processed in any form and can also be rounded and small.
You can pull it and make it a needle gold shape, and it can be wrapped or wrapped. If you stretch it or press it, it will also be a plate shape.
It can be extended very thin and attached to other metals.It can also be thin as it can be used for the decoration of the painting of a handwriting called "Color Writing".
This is called the pH of chemicals.You can make a test paper with a rubber juice.
Cabbage juice reacts to chemicals and changes color by acidity or alkaline (chloride).
The pH level is shown in the amount of hydrogen ions (H of pH) contained in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen ion is an ion that removes electrons (because hydrogen atoms are composed of one ion and one electron).
Give two dried powder together, put it around and hold it with a clean, wet hand.
The water on the hand reacts with the external layer, becoming a strange feeling, forming something like a shell.
In the cities of Harapper and Mohendjodalo, a waterway was arranged and almost all houses had a water bathroom.
In the houses of the towns of Minoa on the Greek island of Cretà and Santorini, submarines have been found.
There were toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China; some examples of the Roman civilization were installed as part of the public bathroom facilities.
If you call someone a thousands of miles away, it will automatically be a satellite call.
Artificial satellites in the universe receive the call and reflect it almost instantly.
The satellite was sent to space by rocket. The reason for scientists using telescopes in space is because some of the light and view that enters human vision is distorted by Earth's atmosphere.
To launch satellites and telescopes and deploy them into space, we need a huge rocket of more than 100 feet high.
This wheel has incredibly changed the world.The greatest achievement that this wheel has brought to us is that it has made the transportation much better and faster.
Trains, cars, and many other means of transport came from there.
Below there are a lot of medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized catfishes from crowns to camomishes and rabbits.
Finally, there are a lot of small cats (including wild cats) that feed a much larger number of small catfishs, such as insects, cats, cats, and birds.
The secret to success is the concept of niche, that each cat has a special job and does not compete with other cats.
The lions are the most social cats and live in a large group called pride.
The pride consists of one to three blood-related bears and more than 30 bears and children.
Usually, the mes are linked with each other by blood and form a family of sisters and daughters.
The lion's pride shows behavior similar to the wolves and dogs, and the animals are surprisingly similar to the lion's behavior (but other big cats) and keeps them without missing the catch.
A really uniform body and a high-motivation tigre can (although not well) climb, swim, jump long distances, and pull five times the power of a hard man.
The bears belong to the same animal group (the bears) as the lions, the bears, and the jags. Only these four types of large cats can swallow.
The tiger's cry is not a cry like a lion, but a cry like a suppressive threat complaint.
Oselots prefer to eat small animals.The monkeys, serpents, frogs, birds, etc. If possible, they can be captured.The majority of the hunting of Oselots are much smaller creatures than themselves.
Scientists believe that Oselots are searching for and pursuing the place through which animals (fathers) feed and smell the soil.
It is very good at nightlight with high obscene vision, and it is also skilled in moving and hiding. Ocelot slides in the surroundings, jumping on the hunt and hunting.
When a small group of creatures (a small number of individuals) depart from the large group they belonged to (for example, moving across mountains or rivers, or moving to a new island that is easily unable to return), you will often realize that they are in a different environment than before.
As this new environment has different resources and different competitors, the new group will need different characteristics and adaptations from what was needed before, and may become a strong competitor.
The original group has not changed at all, and it still needs to be adapted as it was before.
When a new group begins to adapt to a new environment, it begins to appear differently from the other groups over time.
Finally, in thousands to millions of years, two individual groups will appear so different that they cannot be called the same species.
Although this process is called seed formation, this simply means the formation of new species. seed formation is an inevitable result and is a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans smoke and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans (as a breath) throw out.
Plants make food from the sun through light synthesis, and the shadow also makes it.
We build houses with plants, and we make clothes with plants. Many of the foods we eat daily are plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
As Mosaurus was the top fisherman of the time, there was no one to fear except Mosaurus.
The long neck has more than 70 sharp teeth along, and the neck has a different line of teeth, which means there is no way to escape when it passes through.
I don't know the truth, but it may have been two tongues that were divided: they may have eaten snakes and big fish, and they may have eaten other mosaurus.
It will also attack anything that comes into the water, and it will not enemy a huge dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus.
The majority of their foods were familiar to us, but the Romans eaten goods and flavours, such as cranberries, cranberries, cranberries, and a species of cranberries called mice.
Another difference is that poor people and women are sitting on a chair and eating, while wealthy men prefer a party to eat while sleeping and relaxing.
Ancient Roman foods shouldn’t include foods that passed from America and Asia to Europe over the following centuries.
For example, there were no tomatoes, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no coca-cola, and there were no ancient Romans who tasted seven-sided birds.
Babylonians built the first temple for each of the gods, and it was considered the house of the gods.
The people sacrificed their sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the desires of the gods through the ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open middle garden, and there was an inner palace where only the priests entered.
As part of the temple, a special pyramid-like tower, called Gigrate, was built.
The top of the tower was a special holy area for God.
For people living in the warm climate in the Middle East, houses were not so important.
The Hebrew family lived almost outside.
The women cooked in the garden, and the stores were just a room in front of the street; the stones were used for the architecture of the house.
Because there was no large forest in the Canaan land, wood was very expensive and valuable.
According to the northern tradition, the red-haired Erek was expelled from Iceland for murder, and when he went to the west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, regardless of his discovery, the Esquimo tribe had already lived there at the time.
Any country is not "Scandinavia", but Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland have had significant differences in nationality, royality, customs, and history.
Anyone who has ever seen the movie “National Tracker” may think that there is a treasure map behind the American Declaration of Independence.
There was something written on the back, but it was not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was the title of the "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" and the title was reversed at the end of the document.
It is unclear who wrote, but it is known that this large sheep paper (29.75 inches x 24.5 inches and measured) was stored in the early state of its practical use.
Therefore, it is necessary to add the label as a label.
In the D Day landing operation and the following battle, the north of France was liberated, but the south was not yet liberated.
The rulers were the French of the "Visi"; they were the French who joined peace with the German army in 1940, not fighting the invaders, but cooperating with the invaders.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded South France and the invasion was called the Dragon Operation.
In just two weeks, the U.S. Army and the Free French Army liberated South France and went to Germany.
Civilization is a culture, a society, which is shared by a large group of people living and working together.
The word “civilis” comes from the Latin word “civilis” which means citizenship and is associated with the Latin word “civis” which means citizenship, the Latin word “civitas” which means cities and urban states, and which in some way defines the scale of society.
Civilization culture means the inheritance of knowledge over generations, the survival of cultural footprints, and the fair dissemination.
A culture that is removed from the mainstream often disappears without being recognized as a formal civilization, so there is no historical evidence left.
During the Independence War, 13 states first formed a weak central government on the basis of the Allied Treaties, and the Federal Parliament was the only component of it.
The parliament had no authority to tax, and there was no state executive or judicial authority, so all parliamentary actions were dependent on the state authorities, but the state authorities were often non-cooperative.
There was no authority to cancel tax laws or tariffs between the states.
The amendment of the provisions required the unanimous consent of the entire state, but the states neglected the central government, so the representatives were often absent.
The Italian football team, along with the German team, is the world’s second-largest team and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, ballet, waterball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor race.
In the northern region, the winter sports are widespread and it has Italian players to participate in international matches and Olympics.
There are approximately 7,000 islands in Japan, the largest of which is the ninth largest island in the world.
As Japan is an assembly of islands, it is geographically well referred to as the "islands".
Taiwan began in the 15th century with the European sailors naming the island "Illha Formosa" (Beautiful Island).
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its headquarters in southwestern Taiwan, changing the indigenous methods of grain production and hiring Chinese workers to engage in the planting of rice and sugar.
In 1683 the Qingdao Army (1644-1912) occupied the western and northern coastal parts of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared that Taiwan would be a province of Qingdao.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Day Chiang War (1894–1895) the Chinese government signed the Convention and transferred Taiwan’s sovereignty to Japan.
Matthew is composed of three main buildings, the Sun Clock (Intivatana), the Sun Temple (Great Tower) and the Three Window Temple.
Most of the buildings at the end of the complex are rebuilt so that tourists can learn more about their traditional appearance.
Matthew was repaid up to 30% in 1976, and is continuing to be repaid today.
For example, the world's most popular static picture film format was 35 mm, which was the main stream film size at the end of the analog film era.
Although it is still produced today, it is more important that the aspect ratio inherits the image sensor format of the digital camera.
Unfortunately, 35 mm is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this form (which is divided into 12 and requires the simplest total number ratio) is called 3:2.
Many of the common record formats (e.g. APS record formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
"Triple Division" seems to be neglected by some, but it is a simple look that generates dynamism whileining the order of the video.
The most effective position to place the main subject is the part surrounded by the intersection of the line divided into one-third of the length of the image (see example).
The Catholic Church, which has become economically rich and powerful in the European history, has become a strict eye on this time.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has connected different European countries with different languages and habits.
Its universal power influenced everyone, from the king to the civilian.
One of the main doctrines of Christianity is that wealth should be used for the purposes of reducing suffering and poverty, and that the church’s funds are special for it.
The central power of the Church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and the concentration of power and funds has led many to question whether the doctrine is fulfilled.
Soon after the hostility began, Britain began a maritime blockade against Germany.
Although this strategy was effective and blocked the supply of important military and civil supplies, this blockade was a violation of international law, which was generally recognized by several international agreements in the past two centuries.
Britain installed mines in the open sea to prevent ships from entering the entire sea, bringing dangers to neutral ships.
Because the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany anticipated the same reaction to its unlimited water war.
In the 1920s, the idea that was spread to most citizens and states was peace and isolation.
The countries that saw the tragedy and cruelty of the war during the First World War hoped that they would not fall into this situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to New York to get a job at Edison.
With a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachler to Thomas Edison, I passed in almost no one word.
Ancient China had its own way of showing age differences, and every stage of the Chinese history, or a family held power, became a characteristic monarchy.
Furthermore, between each dynasty, there was an unstable era of the divided districts; the most well-known of these era was the Three-Nations era, intertwined by the Han and Chongqing era, which lasted for 60 years.
During this time, many nobles were fighting for the throne.
The triangle was one of the most bloody times in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of soldiers struggling to reach the highest level in the Grand Palace of Xi'an.
It had many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the Metral Law, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, the patriotism, and the belief that the country is not a single ruler, but a nation.
After the revolution, the profession and the publication system became all men eligible to apply, and those with the most desire and victory became able to get the job.
The same can be said in the army, because it was not a class based on the class of the army, but a class based on the ability.
The French Revolution stimulated many working classes that were repressed in other countries, and the revolution began in different countries.
Muhammad had a deep interest in issues beyond his everyday life; he frequently visited a cave called "Hira" on the "Null" (light) mountain for meditation.
The cave that remains beyond the time clearly depicts the appearance of Mohammad’s spiritual inclination.
The cave is located on the top of the mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even knowing the existence of the cave.When you enter the cave, there is a completely isolated space.
There is nothing to see except the clear and beautiful sky above and the many mountains around; from the cave, the outside world is hardly seen, and no sound of the outside world is heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one in the Seven Wonders.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many large pyramid buildings built to worship the dead Pharaoh.
The Highlands of Giza, which extends to the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid of Giza), several small tombs, temples, and a great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid is a huge tomb built in honor of King Pharaoh Quev, and many of the small pyramids, tombs and temples around it are to honor the wife and family of King Quev.
The elevated arc mark looks like the letter V, and the lower arc mark is the shape of the lack of the bottom of the hoticus needle or square shape.
Up is starting from the front end and pushing the arrow, and down is starting from the flog (where the arrow is kept by the hand) and pulling the arrow.
The lifting arrow generates a typical and narrow sound, and the downing arrow generates a stronger and stronger sound.
You can freely write the symbol with a pen, but keep in mind that there is a musical reason for the correspondence of the printed arc.
On October 6, 1789, angry King Louis 16, Queen Mary Antoinette and two young children (Mary Theresa, 11 years old, and Louis Charles, 4 years old), and her sister, Princess Elizabeth, were forced to return from the Palace of Versailles to Paris by the women of the markets that were turbulent.
When they were on the car, they came back to Paris, surrounded by the rebels who were crying to the king and the queen and threatening words.
The crowd turned into rebels and made the king and the queen open the window of the car.
One time, in front of the fearful queen, one of the rebels showed the neck of the royal family guards who were killed in the Palace of Versailles.
The costs spent on the conquest of the Philippines in the war by American imperialism were borrowed by the Philippines.
They were forced to pay interest on bonds that were sold on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street bank, and they were forced to pay interest on tax to the U.S. colonial government to cover the majority of their expenditure.
Of course, the excess profits from the long-term exploitation of the Philippines would be a fundamental benefit of American imperialism.
To understand the Temple Knights, you need to understand the context in which the order was born.
The period in which this incident occurred is called the Middle Ages and is generally equivalent to the periods of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries in European history (1000-1300).
The Middle Ages are considered to be the period between the early and late Middle Ages as a historical distinction of times, and the late Middle Ages are considered to have ended until 1500s.
Technical Decision Theory is a term that actually includes a wide range of thinking, starting from technological advancement and technical standards, to the strict meaning that human fate is driven by the logic in the foundation of its manifestation in scientific laws and technology.
Most interpretations of technological decision theory share two general theories: one is that the development of technology itself follows a way that is far beyond cultural and political influence, and the other is that technology is not socially conditioned, but rather "influencing" the inner society.
For example, it can be said that cars inevitably lead to the development of the road.
However, as only a few cars do not meet the national road network, we are developing new methods of production to reduce the cost of ownership of cars.
The increase in car owners will lead to an increase in the incidence of road accidents, resulting in the development of new technologies for treating injured bodies in the medical field.
In Romanticism, there was a major element of the cultural determination theory formed by the writers of Geth, Fith, and Shreegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography formed the individual and, over time, the habits and cultures involved in its geography were born, which was better than the law that harmonized with the place of society and was imposed by itself.
As Paris is known as the center of fashion in the modern world, in the feudal Europe, Constantinople was prospering as the center of fashion.
His reputation as the center of luxury clothing began around 400 BC and lasted around 1100 BC.
In the 12th century, the status was decreased, mainly due to the return of cross soldiers with gifts such as silk and flavour that were more valuable than the bizantine market.
It was this time that the title as the center of fashion moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The most famous period of Gothic style was between the 10th and 11th centuries.
The original decor was strongly influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to the late communication routes, the Western style may be 25 to 30 years late.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style: one of the greatest advances that occurred as a result of the Crusade was that it began to use the button to close the clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a form of agriculture that produces only the amount of food that the farmers and their families need.
Self-serving agriculture is a simple system that aims to maximize the yield, combined with circular and other relatively simple technologies, of the preserved seeds that are self-served in the ecosystem areas, and is often organic agriculture.
Historically, the majority of farmers operate self-sufficient agriculture, and many developing countries still see this trend.
Subculture is a culture where fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow.
The characteristics of subcultures may be determined by the age, ethnicity, class, location, gender, etc. of the members to whom they belong.
The character that determines the characteristics of subcultures may be a language, beauty, religion, politics, gender, geography, or a combination of these elements.
Members of subcultures often show that they are a part of them in a symbolic unique style, including fashion, manicure, and discretion.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to take a few unfortunate cases of children who have been blocked by adult adaptation to society during their growth process by abandonment of childbirth, misfortune, or intentional abuse.
This kind of child is called "Wild Child" or "Feralkid."Wild Child can sometimes be imprisoned by people (usually their parents), and as a cause of such abandonment of childbirth, parents may have rejected childbirth of children with severe mental and physical disorders.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or escaped.
There are also those who are said to have been raised by animals, and some who are said to have lived in a wild state.
Wild children raised and raised by animals other than humans show almost the same behavior (in the physical scope) as their animals, such as fear of humans or indifference to humans.
Learning on a project-based basis should be easier and more interesting, but scalping takes one step ahead of it.
Scarford is not a way of learning, but to support people who use new computer programs, start new projects, or have new learning experiences.
Scapfording has both virtual and real; in other words, teachers are a form of scapfording, as well as a Microsoft Office clip doll.
Virtual Scapold is incorporated into this software and aims to enable students to ask questions, instructions, and explain about the procedures that they find difficult on their own.
The reasons why children are placed in the parental system varies from abandonment to abuse and even persecution.
Any child should be raised in an environment of education, care, and care, but wild children are raised in an environment without it.
We recognize that the parental system is a safe area for these children.
The parental system provides a safe family, loving childbirth, secure education, and reliable care.
The family system is to provide all the necessary items that were missing in the house before being taken.
Internet is an environment that combines both the elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The remarkable features of the Internet bring further dimensions from the point of view of use and satisfactory approaches.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as an important motive for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995) .
“Personal involvement” and “continuous relationship” were identified as new motivating aspects when Eighmey & McCord (1998) investigated the audience’s responses to the website.
The use of video recording leads to important discoveries in interpreting microexpressions that last a few milliseconds, i.e. the movements of the face.
In particular, it claims that by interpreting the micro-expression accurately, it will see if the person is lying.
Oliver Sachs points out in his paper "President's Speech" that even those who have a brain disorder and cannot understand the speech can correctly evaluate their honesty.
He suggests that such ability to interpret human behavior is common to animals, such as dogs.
Studies of the 20th century have found that genetic mutations have two genetic swimming pools, although they have been revealed as hidden.
A sudden mutation involves a new genetic mutation and is removed from the swimming pool of the mutation in which it is expressed by elimination.
Living and transformation shapes mutations while going between two swimming pools per generation.
For humans with a digestive system, it is difficult to consume essential amino acids from the plant resources available in the Savannah environment.
Furthermore, missing it leads to serious situations, such as growth depression, nutrition disorders, and ultimately leads to death.
The most accessible plant resource was the protein found in the leaves and beans, but this is a difficult nutrient to digest without cooking for pastors like us.
On the other hand, animal foods (wheat, silhouette, eggs) are a good source of protein that contains all essential amino acids as easy to digest.
Considering all the points, it’s not surprising that our ancestors had solved the “protein problem” just like the chimpanzees living in today’s Savannah.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately wake up during the normal sleep time and falling to sleep after a while (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to recall awareness without fully awakening.
When you notice that the alarm stops unconsciously, you have a hand to put the clock on the other side of the room and make it impossible to stop without leaving the bed.
Other methods based on biorysm include drinking a lot of water (especially water and teas with urine effect) before sleep and making it unnecessary to wake up to urinate.
The degree that shows the peace of the mind of a person is the opposite of the degree of physical and mental tension.
The lower the tension, the more positive vitality is born.Everyone has the potential capacity to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Anyone can open awareness.The only thing that interferes with this goal is his own anxiety and negative feelings.
The Tibetan Buddhism is a faith based on Buddhist doctrine, but it has been extended to incorporate many techniques from Buddhist mercy and Indian yoga.
As a principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that is all mercy.
Kundalini Yoga is a combination of yoga poses, breathing, mantra, mudra, etc. that aims to wake up Kundalini (the soul of itself).
The center of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga. By visualizing different gods, energy channels are purified, chakra is activated, and awareness of awareness is born.
In the Second World War, Germany was a common enemy and led to the cooperation of the Soviet Union and the United States. After the end of the war, the two countries became confronted by the conflict of institutions, processes and cultures.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
After that, for 40 years, a real battle from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, and Cuba took place by the representative armies.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridge.
More than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army formed the Belarusian Front and the Ukrainian Front after invading the eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Invasion Treaty, and other international treaties (international and multinational).
Transporting goods by ships is the most efficient way to massive transport of people and goods across the sea.
More than usual, the work of the Navy was toin its capacity to transport its citizens and supplies and at the same time toly disrupt its capacity to transport its enemy citizens and supplies.
As a recent most notable example, there is the North Atlantic Operation of the Second World War: the United States tried to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was mainly using U boats to try to stop this transport.
If the allies were defeated, Germany would probably have conquered Britain as other European countries.
Sheep breeding began about 10,000 years ago, and its center is believed to be in the west of the Zagros mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to possess cows that were easy to access with milk, hair, meat and skin.
Generally, sheep beasts were lived and lived in mountains and other livestock, but the sheep owners who took care of the sheep were mostly boys.This habit continues today.
In England, in the 16th century, car roads were already installed.
The truck was only placed parallelly with the plate, but by the horse pulling it, it was able to transport baggage faster than the damn road at that time.
Wipes were introduced in a fairly early stage to fix the line to the specified position; later, it was gradually noticed that the efficiency of installing an advance of iron on the top was good.
This has become common, but iron has been the cause of the drilling of the wooden wheels of the car.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels.In 1767, the total iron rail was introduced for the first time.
The first known means of movement was walking, and the direct walking of mankind began two million years ago at the time of the appearance of the Homo Electas (the meaning of "direct man").
Australopitex, a direct ancestor, had no habit to keep walking straight for more than a certain time.
Although the Sahelantropus could have been walking on two legs seven million years ago, the characteristics of the two legs are confirmed by the fossils of the Australopithecus 390 to 4.2 million years ago.
You can start a more environmentally friendly life, participate in environmental movements, and become an activist to some extent reduce future suffering.
In many cases, this is like an antipsymotherapy, but it is necessary not only to seek a temporary solution, but to identify the fundamental cause of the problem and disable it.
It is quite clear that the advances of human science and technology have greatly changed the world, and that the problems have expanded due to excessive population and luxurious life.
After being adopted by the parliament on 4 July, the handwritten draft signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the John Dunrap printing station in several districts.
150 to 200 copies were copied in a night, and it is now called the “Dunrap Broad Side”.
The first public reading of this document was done by John Nixon in the Garden of the Independence Memorial on July 8.
The one was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to the army in New York on July 9; the other one arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunrap Broad Side, which is known to exist, is the oldest copy of the existing literature.
Today, many anti-biologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today.
There are many people who can fly with their wings, so they don’t think they’re dinosaurs.
But today, the birds look similar to dinosaurs in many ways.
He has scratches and nails with his legs, is an ovarian, and he walks with two legs back like Tyrannosaurus.
In fact, all the computers that are used today are based on the manipulation of information symbolized by two-degree numbers.
The double numbers are represented in either of the two values (0 or 1) and for the use of the computer term, these numbers are called the double numbers or bits.
Internal addiction may not become clear immediately; vomiting is a common symptom, so you can’t make an immediate diagnosis.
The most obvious sign of internal addiction is that the containers of drugs and toxic home chemicals are open.
Look at the toxic labels and see if there are instructions for emergency treatment for that particular toxic.
Insectologists use the name of insects for this group of insects in the official sense.
This name is derived from the fact that cocodrome was spread from ancient times to bed as a parasitic insect with a high adaptability.
Sheep and tocoside are both a reservoir that is adapted to living in the host's nest and residence.
In the United States, the known number of cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) is estimated to be about 400,000, and is known as a representative nerve disease in young and middle ages.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system consisting of the brain, spine and visual nerve.
Studies have found that women have a double chance of developing multiple sclerosis (MS) than men.
There are couples who will decide that childbirth is not profitable for both parents.
These couples can use the adoption system for their baby.
In adoption, the real parents lose their parental rights and the other couple can become the parents of the child.
The main purpose of science is to reveal the world’s mechanisms by scientific methods; in fact, this method has become the guidance of most scientific research.
Experiments are tests used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, and asking questions or observing is also a guideline for scientific research.
Naturists and philosophers took attention to the classical books, especially the Bible written in Latin.
It was accepted by the views of Aristotle on all matters of science, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, we realized that the Western countries were separated from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often decisively dependent on the presence of an intrusive cycle and on the line that is drawn through an internal clock.
The cyclic rhythm is not just a response to cyclic signals from the outside, but is recorded on most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The internal clock is an independent vibrator that continues to circulate freely for a certain period of time, without any signals from the outside.
The Harsey and Chase experiments were one of the powerful experiments suggesting that DNA is a genetic substance.
Hersey and Chase used a farge (virus) to transplant their DNA into bacteria.
They tried two experiments, one of which was a experiment that marked with radioactive linen on the farge DNA, and the other was a experiment that marked with radioactive sulfur on the farge protein.
Sudden mutations may have different effects, depending on the type of mutations, the meaning of the defects of the affected genetic substance, and whether the affected cells are reproductive cells.
Only sudden mutations occurring in the reproductive cells are inherited to the child, and sudden mutations occurring in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism that emphasizes touch with nature attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy landscapes including wild animals.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits, and environmental surveys.
For example, you can go to Orlando on the island of Borneo, take pictures and learn.
Every morning, those who leave a small rural town and go to work are different from those who have a workplace near their starting point.
In this dynamic travel transport, everyone connects and supports it in some way with a car-based transport system.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone who has a social life uses the transportation facility; most of them are dissatisfied with the transportation system.
In advanced countries, there are little complaints about water quality and bridges falling.
Why does the transportation generate such complaints and everyday failures? are the transportation technicians only unable or are there any more fundamental problems?
Traffic flow study is the study of the movement of the individual driver and vehicle between two points and their interaction.
Unfortunately, the driver’s behavior cannot be forecast with a 100% chance, so it’s hard to study traffic flows.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range, and therefore traffic flows tend to have a certain degree of reasonable consistency, and can be mathematically broadly expressed.
For more accurate representation of traffic flow, a relationship is established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships will help in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the sky.The ability to fly in the sky helped to escape the enemy, and effectively find food and companions.
Most insects are able to turn their wings along the body.
This expands a narrow space to hide from the fishermen.
Currently, insects that cannot turn their wings are only tombo and cage.
Thousands of years ago, a scientist named Aristalcos said that the solar system is moving around the sun.
Some recognized his theory as right, but many believed that in the solar system the sun (and other stars) was moving around the earth.
If you don’t feel like the earth is moving, it seems to be reasonable.
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. The water volume exceeds eight times the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the largest river on Earth, and there are some places where the river is 6 miles wide.
20 percent of the water flowing from the river to the sea is from the Amazon river.
The main stream of the Amazon river reaches a length of 6,387 km (3,980 miles), which gathers water from thousands of small rivers.
The construction of the stone pyramid continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but the pyramid of Giza was superior to others in its size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were surprised by the prehistoric monuments built more than a thousand years ago at that time.
The Vatican City Country has a population of about 800 people.It is the world's smallest independent country and also the lowest inhabited country.
In the Vatican City Country, Italian is used in law and official communications.
The language used by most people working in the Vatican City Country is Italian, and Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican citizens are Roman Catholics.
It is known that basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, copper have been valued by humans since ancient times, both of which can be found in natural shapes in nature and can be relatively easily mined with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed the theory that all things are made up of things mixed with one or more of the four elements: the four elements are soil, water, air, and fire.
This is close to the four forms of matter, solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but his theory also suggested that they transform into new substances and form what appears in this world.
The alloy is essentially a mixture of more than two types of metals. Remember the many elements listed in the cycle table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are metals; of course, there are metals such as silver and gold.
Those that contain a few non-metal elements, such as carbon, are also classified as alloys.
Everything in the universe is made of matter; every matter is made of small particles called atoms.
The atoms are small enough to be imagined, so the last pyridoe of this phrase can contain a number of trillions of atoms.
In this way, the pen that came out of the world at the time was a good friend for many.
Unfortunately, with the appearance of a new book law, the position and use of the pen has decreased.
Now more people enter the message on the computer’s screen and no need to cut a pen.
If there is something new, I think what will happen to the keyboard.
A nuclear bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to gather many atoms and neutrons in one atom.
It’s like rotating a heavy truck and climbing a hill.When the atomic nucleus is divided again, a part of its energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable atomic nucleus, and the atomic nucleus tends to divide without doing almost anything.
The moon's surface is made of rocks and dust; the outer layer of the moon is called the ground shell.
The thickness of the shell is about 70 km on the front and about 100 km on the back.
The sea is thinner, and the high ground is thinner.
Because the shell was thinner, there could be more seas nearby; the slurry was easier to float.
The content theory focuses on finding something that touches people’s minds or appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and desires that are internalized as they meet adulthood and mature.
These theories examine the motivations that a kind of people want to do a particular thing on a daily basis, and the environmental factors that make or do not make them do a particular thing.
The two content theories are the Maslow’s desire phase theory and the Hertzberg’s two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, if the management position has become the leader of the former colleagues, two similar behaviors may appear: one is the behavior that attempts to remain "one of the colleagues".
This type of administrator is unpleasant to make decisions to buy disappointment, punishment, performance assessment, responsibility allocation, and confirmation of the place of responsibility.
The opposite is to transform the team into a person that is unrecognized by those who feel they have to change everything they have done with their own hands.
After all, the leader will ultimately be responsible for the team’s failure.
This behavior often causes a breakthrough between the leader and the rest of the members.
Virtual teams are required to have the same level of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as a window of a direct physical group.
Virtual teams may hold meetings in time zone, but this is difficult to understand by the local management team, so members are more likely to have a higher autonomy than traditional team members.
The existence of a true “unseen team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of the virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team of each member; the invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why do organizations want to go through a time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? there is innovation in one of the purposes of practicing the concept of organizational learning.
If all available resources cross the functional sectors of the organization and are effectively exploited, creativity and creativity may be created.
As a result, the process that the organization collaborates to overcome disabilities may lead to new innovative processes to meet the needs of customers.
In order for the organization to be innovative, leadership must not only share knowledge and organizational learning, but also create a culture of innovation.
In 2006, Angel described a series approach as a way to help organizations reach higher performance levels.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognitive research, which makes the research area narrow and more accurate research possible.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior confirms the research of scientists.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, disease, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies has made it possible to see and explore the structure and processes of the brain that have not been revealed before.
This has made it possible to obtain a lot of information and material that helps in building simulation models to understand human mental effects.
Although AI has a strong SF meaning, it forms a very important field in computer science and processes behavior, learning, and intellectual adaptation by machine.
AI research involves the manufacturing of machines that automatize tasks required by acts that require intelligence.
For example, it includes control, planning, schedule management, customer diagnosis and answering questions, and handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
This is another field that focuses on solving real-life problems.
Currently, AI systems are integrated into some home computers and video game software, while they are used very frequently in the fields of economics, healthcare, engineering and military.
The majority of the classes are suburban learning. Teachers try to take students quite frequently to places where they can’t go on a bus trip.
The technology offers learning methods through virtual social science visits. Students can stay in the classroom to see museum works, visit the aquarium, or observe beautiful art.
Also, virtually sharing out-of-school learning is a great way to look back on your travel and share your experiences in your future classes.
For example, Benet School students in North Carolina each year create a website on travel to the state and the website is revised every year, but the old site is stored online so that it can be viewed as a scrapbook.
Blogging is also helpful in improving students’ writing skills.The students who have just started writing blogging are less grammatical and continuous, but there is a change with readers.
As students are often the most critical readers, blog writers begin to try to improve the text to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging “will make students more familiar with the world around them.” – The need to attract the audience’s interest makes students more intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004)
Blogging is a tool that encourages students to promote co-work and expand their learning sphere beyond the range of traditional classes.
By correctly using the blog, “the student’s analytical and critical ability is improved. by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position in the context written by others and show their own views on specific issues” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the attractive capital of Canada that speaks two languages and has many museums and museums to present Canada’s past and present.
In the south there are the Niagara Falls, and in the north there are untouchable natural beauty like Moscow.
Thanks to all of this, Ontario is considered to be a remarkable and third-party-looking Canadian state.
In addition, the vast regions of the north have a small population, and there are indigenous areas where few people don’t live.
Many people surprise the population comparison: the number of African-Americans living in the United States is more than the number of Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean on the east coast of the African continent.
Madagascar is the largest island beyond the crowd and its unique continent as the habitat of wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent countries, or related countries to France, and there are also famous luxury beach resorts.
Also, the Arabs brought Islam to this land, which was widely accepted in the comor and the mayoth.
In the 15th century, the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route from Europe through the Peak of Joy to India, where the influence and colonialism of Europe began.
The north is bordered with the Sahel, and the south and the west are surrounded by the Atlantic.
Women: Women travelers are advised to declare that they are married, regardless of the actual marriage relationship.
It is effective to keep the ring (not so high).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can be a behavior called harassment, and it is not unusual that they are traced or caught in their arms.
When you refuse a man's invitation, go through your position with a sturdy attitude (whether there is a cultural difference, you don't have to fear a compulsory invitation!)
The foundation of the modern city of Casablanca was named Anfa, which was built by the Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, after which the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Morocco used this land as a strategic port.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, but after the 1755 earthquake they eventually left the city.
The city was rebuilt by the Moroccan sultan as the Daral Badiya and was named Casablanca by the Spanish traders who established a trade base.
Casablanca is one of the most difficult places to enjoy shopping in Morocco.
In the vicinity of Old Medina, it is easy to find places to sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as taze, ceramics, leather products, Hokkaido, but they are all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the goma was destroyed by the slopes of the Niragongo volcano, and most of the streets, especially the city center, were overwhelmed.
Goma is quite safe, but if you visit a place other than Goma, you need to investigate and understand the situation of the battle that will continue in North Kiev.
The city is a mountain climb to the Nizhny Novgorod volcano and is also one of the cheapest mountain gorillas tracking places in Africa.
You can use a bodyboard (bicycle taxi) to travel in Goma. The normal (local) fee is about 500 Congo francs on a short distance.
The land name "Timbuktu" has become a place that is not easy to go, and has become used as an exotic and remote land cave.
Today's Timbuko has become a tourist destination for its reputation, and there are airports but a poor city.
In 1990 it was added to the list of dangerous World Heritage in order to protect from the threat of desert sand.
He was one of the main stages in the PBS special show Wonders of the African World (Wonders of the African World) by Henry Lewis Gates.
The city is stronger than the Arabic color than the African city, and the atmosphere is contrary to the other cities in the country.

The island of Hong Kong, as its name, is the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists visit as a sight of tourism.
The buildings standing on the horizon of Hong Kong are compared to a bright shell graph by the presence of the Victoria Harbor water.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, go out of the island and go to the Nine Dragon Waterfront.
The urban development of the Hong Kong Island is concentrated mostly on the coastline along the northern coast.
This is the place where British colonial rulers make their territory, so those who are looking for evidence of the colonial era should start from here.
Sunderbance is the world’s largest coastal Mongol area, ranging 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the indigenous areas of Bangladesh and India.
The Sunderban Mountains are listed as the UNESCO World Heritage Site and some of the forests in India are called the Sunderban National Park.
This forest is not just a landscape where manglobe grows; the forest also includes the last place where the vast jungle, which once covered the Hindu-Stern square, remains.
The area of Sunderbance is 3,850 km2 and about one-third of it is covered by water / wet areas.
Since 1966, Sunderbance has become a wildlife protected area, and today it is estimated to have 400 Royal Bengaltra and about 30,000 Axisziques.
The buses depart between the regional bus stations (through the river) throughout the day, but most buses, especially the buses to the east and the buses to Jakarta/Bumton, depart between 6:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.
The area buses are often filled, so we recommend buying tickets a few days before.
The majority of the districts operate Japanese-made coaster buses, both of which are comfortable and robust small buses.
To travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nultam) and Ponaca (200 Nultam), it is easy to use a taxi.
This bridge on the river of Oyapok connects the city of Oyapok in Brazil and San Giorgio de Loyapok in the French province of Guyana.

The upper space under the bridge is 15 meters; it was completed in August 2011 and was not opened until March 2017.
The full opening of the bridge is scheduled to be in September 2017 and the Brazilian customs inspection is expected to be over.
The guaranians were the most important indigenous peoples living in the present east of Paraguay, and lived as a half-pastor hunting peoples, and also conducted self-sufficient farming.
In the Chako district lived groups such as the Guikles and the Piyaguans, other indigenous peoples who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, through the encounter of the Spanish conquerors and indigenous peoples, Paraguay was born (formerly known as the “Great State of the West Indies”).
The Spanish colonial era began and it continued in three centuries.
Since the founding of Assuntion in 1537, Paraguay has left a lot of indigenous characteristics and uniqueity.

“Rain season” and “dry season” are not special, and the amount of rain throughout the year is almost certain.
Many of the animals in the park are familiar with humans, but still wild animals are merely wild, so don’t feed them or surprise them.
According to the park authorities, we must keep a distance of at least 100 yards (100 meters) from bears and wolves and 25 yards (25 meters) from other wild animals!
Even if it looks adult, Bison, Heracles, American Heracles, Bears, and almost all big animals can attack you.
Every year, there are dozens of travellers injured because they don’t keep the right distance.These wild animals are large and potentially dangerous, so make sure they don’t enter the land.
Also, the smell can attract wild animals such as bears, so avoid carrying and cooking of smellful foods and take care of a clean camp.

Those who drive high width locations or roofs should consider the possibility of snow, ice, and ice points.
Snowways and frozen roads are less friction and cannot drive as asphalt roads.
When the snow falls, there is enough snow to stop in a short time.
Also, snow falls or blows, and the window is covered with ice and the sight is restricted.
On the other hand, in many countries there is a lot of snow, but traffic continues almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is probably the best tourist attraction in Africa and is a tourist point for many tourists.
Safari refers to land roads aimed at observing wild animals in Africa, especially wild animals in Savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and chillins, tend to get closer to the car, so using standard equipment can be clearly observed.
