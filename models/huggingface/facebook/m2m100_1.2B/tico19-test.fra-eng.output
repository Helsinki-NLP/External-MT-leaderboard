Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus cases (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the European Union/EEA countries and the UK, confirming that, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing in all countries.
According to Italy’s experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services need to prepare for a peak of patients with COVID-19 requiring care, and especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified the agent as a new coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have a benign condition, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, most of which recover.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 leads to a more severe injury requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a serious form of the disease requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we evaluate the evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), and compare it with the evolution in the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 has continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of this country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were by France on 24 January 2020 among people returning from Wuhan, in the Hubei province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom (UK) with, between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy alone.
Calculating the cumulative number and incidence of COVID-19 cases
The number of cases of COVID-19 in each country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as health ministries, national and regional health authorities of different countries and the WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
This data was used to evaluate the evolution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare it with the experience in Italy.
To assess the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases in each country on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 p.m. with data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Evolution of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The evolution of the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK generally followed that of the Hubei province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to grow around 21 February before seeing a drastic increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This development was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (supplementary data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of 15 March at 8:00 p.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our findings indicate that the number of cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the UK.
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this despite the fact that countries are at different stages and there are differences in responses from national public health services, potential variations in case definitions and differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including for catch-up tests.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy that about 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care, and the media that the hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitals and/or intensive care admissions are currently available across the EU/EEA for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (non-reported data).
However, systematic collection is needed to supplement current monitoring data, which focuses on the number of cases and deaths.
A 2010–11 study showed a significant difference in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 individuals in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12,5 intensive and intermediate care beds per 100,000 individuals in 2010–11).
Modeling scenarios for capacity saturation in care, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and UK of the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases associated with a risk of 90% capacity excess in intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the COVID-19 Rapid Risk Assessment of the CEPCM.
Since cases were previously grouped in certain regions of the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and because hospitals and intensive care services generally accommodate a defined regional population, the data on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be established at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units (NUTS 2).
Italian experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing within the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore prepare for a sustained community-wide transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 as well as an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of care, especially intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in the recent CEPCM Rapid Risk Assessment, a quick, proactive and exhaustive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, moving from an endogenous approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid and early increase in cases may not leave enough time for policymakers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been implemented in advance.
The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window during which each country will be able to strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health services.
Otherwise, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a peak of patients in need of intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere, causing a humanitarian catastrophe.
Like its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of cases of SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by mice and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more transmissible, and affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this emerging research topic.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still await answers, we hope this review will help to better understand and eradicate this serious disease.
The Spring Festival, January 25, 2020, marked the Chinese forever, who were forced to stay cloistered for the entire duration of the Golden Week as well as for long other weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) in 2003; therefore it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan and quickly spread throughout China before spreading to 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 is the “public enemy number one”, potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, in virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020 showing the virus sequence, isolated from several patients.
This review tries to synthesize research progress on this emerging new topic.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus disease, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, an outbreak that occurred in 2012).
We will also review what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and prognosis, and address some questions still pending but urgent.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered to be non-fatal pathogens for humans, causing mainly about 15% of common colds.
During this century, however, we have seen two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before rapidly spreading to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
COVID-19 is the third coronavirus outbreak in recent history.
As shown in Fig.1.1, foci of pneumonia of then unknown origin were first in Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was revealed.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, it was that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that inter-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was placed in quarantine with interruption of all public transportation.
On January 24, the first clinical trial on the disease indicated that, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered the starting point of infection with an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
At the time of writing this report, the disease had already spread to all of China and 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the extent and severity of the epidemic remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, provided an updated overview of the outbreak as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly in the 30-65-year-old group.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected people were over 50, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was developing in homes, mainly in Hubei province and the periphery.
The average time between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average time between the onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The base reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% IC: 3,51-4,05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4,82.
The number of infected people had increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, which coincides with the massive displacements that took place before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% IC: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% IC: 2.02-4,59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (man), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large, wrapped viruses containing a single-string RNA.
They can be classified into four genres, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronaviruses known to infect humans belonging to the genres alpha and beta.
Spike glycoprotein (S) in the envelope binds to the angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cellular receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
Viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoprotein and nucleocapside proteins form vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on January 10, 2020.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta coronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples taken from the site of origin of the epidemic, the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Using transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-thin sections of the human epithelium of the respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less significant infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by orph3b as well as a secreted protein coded by orph8.
SARS-CoV-2 orph3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orph8 does not contain known domains or functional patterns.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al., presented the complete human ACE2 cryo-ME structure at a resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which presented open and closed formations, was assembled in the form of a dimer and that the complex ACE2-B0AT1 could bind two S proteins, which provides indications for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original host and the intermediate host
It has been established that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from mice and were transmitted to humans via civettes and camelids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, mice were promoted as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% identical to the two SRAS-type coronaviruses from mice called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the transmission pathway is still to be clarified.
Ji, et al., hypothesized that the virus could have been transmitted from mice to humans by snakes, which would involve homologous recombination within the protein S.
According to a study conducted by researchers from Guangzhou, China, pangolin – a long-mushroom mammal feeding on ants, often used in traditional Chinese medicine – could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 if judged by the 99% genetic homology achieved between a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% gap between two genomes constitutes a significant difference; therefore, it is worth waiting for conclusive results to establish concrete evidence (Fig. 33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for up to 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may possess similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays as well as at a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75 percent ethanol, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, no detailed study has been on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.
Generally, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the host’s innate immune system through molecular pattern recognition receptors (MRRs), including lectin type C receptors, Toll type receptors (TLRs), NOD type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I type receptors (RLRs).
By different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis macrophage of viral antigens.
However, the N-protein in SARS-CoV can allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, especially CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Helping T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defensive cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing their apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential in combating viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive response from the immune system causes a localized explosion of the number of free radicals, which can result in severe damage to the lungs as well as other organs and, in the worst case, multivisceral failure, or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a focal occurrence, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is commonly accepted that people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to become infected than others.
The average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but more generally 3 to 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days for a range of 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded with an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a demography of 8,866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the actual duration of the quarantine to the most accurate incubation period possible, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected with, the virus are placed in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19 and may or may not be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as those with acute fever, even in the absence of chest X-ray abnormalities, should be tested for the virus to allow for early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had fever at 98%, dry cough at 76%, dyspnea at 55% and diarrhea at 3%; 8% of patients needed ventilation assistance.
Similar findings have been in two recent studies conducted on a family and a focal point that appeared as a result of the transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that the main symptoms of patients with MERS-CoV were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%).
However, 80 percent needed ventilatory assistance, which is much more than patients with COVID-19, which is consistent with a higher mortality rate for MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
For SRAS, the main symptoms were fever (99 percent to 100 percent), dry cough (29 percent to 75 percent), dyspnea (40 percent to 42 percent), diarrhea (20 percent to 25 percent) and sore throat (13 percent to 25 percent), and ventilation assistance was needed for approximately 14 percent to 20 percent of patients.
As of 14 February, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2%, out of 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
Comparatively, SRAS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For the MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 reached 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (IC) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV only ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater capacity to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak than it has been for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks.
The appearance of a focal point often occurs within a family or within a gathering or a vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients often traveled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas, or were in contact with infected people or patients within two weeks of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals can be virus carriers without symptoms for more than two weeks, and that recovered patients can be virus carriers again, highlighting the need to increase quarantine duration.
Patients have a normal or decreased number of peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of 4 × 109/L and a lymphocyte count of 1 × 109/L, as well as high aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia were identified in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a degradation product of fibrine present in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Thoracic X-ray abnormalities have been observed in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by bilateral uneven shadows or opacity of depolit glass in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ASD).
In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously impair gas exchange.
Dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes leads to a decrease in the level of surfactant and an increase in surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to swell and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the most disturbing chest examinations often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed pneumocyte desquamation, hyalin membrane formation, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the presence of multinucleated syncytic cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, which coincides with the pathology of viral infection and SDRA and is similar to that of patients with SRAS and MERS.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the primary criterion for diagnosing COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the outbreak, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which then no longer relied solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation was observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which identifies synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of sample) using a reactive band in less than an hour, without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality if its use on clinical samples proves conclusive.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors can only offer supportive care to patients with COVID-19 while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table (Table2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, recovered patient plasma, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma of recovered patients was offered for treatment purposes.
Pharmaceutical companies are all engaged in the development of antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also, to a lesser extent, other ACE2 expressing organs, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nonetheless, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat to patients, and the leading cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieving symptoms and saving lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation as well as invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary derivation technique used to treat critical heart or respiratory failure.
Furthermore, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It has been established that excessive immune response leads to cytokine shock in patients with SRAS and MERS.
A cytokine shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and multivisceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine shocks, especially in severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to treat cytokine shocks.
Other immunosuppressive therapies for cytokine shocks include modulation of T-cell immune response, IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF cytokine blocking, JAK inhibition, blinatumomab, cytokine signal suppressor 4 and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressant agents, have been widely used in the treatment of SRAS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, taking high-dose steroids did not have beneficial effects on severe lung damage in patients with SRAS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would result in serious side effects, including avascular osteonecrosis, thus significantly affecting the prognosis.
However, cautious use of short cycles of low to moderate dose corticosteroids has been recommended for patients with severe forms of COVID-19.
At the time of writing this report, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, has been shown to be effective in one U.S. patient with COVID-19.
Remedesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other single-string RNA viruses, including MERS and SRAS.
In light of these findings, Gilead has delivered the compound to China to allow a number of trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
Furthermore, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir combination and ribavirin have been advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects may occur as a result of combination treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from the disease is an ancestral practice.
In fact, recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen.
Anticorps are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who had been cured from COVID-19 and injected to 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, associated with a decrease in the phenomenon of inflammation, a decrease in viral load and an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary in order to be able to propose this method for large-scale use as long as no specific treatment has been developed.
Furthermore, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can lead to excessive stimulation of the immune response and cause a potentially fatal cytokine-release syndrome.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma for treating seriously ill patients is significant.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and effective to isolate B cells from recovered patients and to identify the genetic codes encoding the relevant antibodies or to search for effective antibodies against the main viral proteins.
This increases the production of antibodies.
MTC has been used in China for thousands of years to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis, based on MTC theories.
Most effective components remain little or no known to the extent that it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal associations.
Currently, due to the lack of an effective specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate or remissive symptoms of a severe form of the disease.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have proven to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The best COVID-19 cure rates were observed in Chinese provinces that used MTC for 87 percent of their patients, including Gansu Province (63.7 percent), Ningxia Region (50 percent) and Hunan (50 percent), while Hubei Province, which used MTC for only 30 percent of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest cure rate (13 percent).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison as many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be taken into account in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study that compared a treatment using Western medicine (MO) alone and a combined treatment combining MO and MTC.
It appeared that the time to return to normal body temperature, the time to disappear symptoms and the duration of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone.
Even more impressive, the rate of aggravation of symptoms (light to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%); likewise, mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of MTC is still to be clarified through controlled trials conducted on a larger scale and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of MTC treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Individuals identified as likely or confirmed cases of COVID-19 generally feel a strong concern about this highly contagious and deadly disease, and those placed in quarantine also experience a feeling of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, can lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early stages of the SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbidities were, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion and even suicidal tendencies.
Compulsory contact search and quarantine, as part of the public health services response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can increase anxiety and lead to some guilt in patients for the effects of the infection, quarantine, and stigma of their family and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, individuals identified as likely cases, people in contact with these populations, as well as any other individual in distress.
This psychological support should include training of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupting the transmission chain from infected animal reservoirs and humans to vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral therapy in controlling outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines to produce long-term potent neutralizing antibodies and/or induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Living attenuated vaccines were evaluated on animal models for SRAS.
However, the in vivo effectiveness of these potential vaccines in elderly people and on models subject to lethal provocation as well as their protection against infection with a zoonotic virus remains to be determined, since no clinical trials have yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that SRAS vanished 17 years ago and no new cases have been since.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and crucial goal in controlling the ongoing outbreak.
However, this is a real challenge due to the significant delay (18 months on average) needed to develop a vaccine and dynamic coronavirus variations.
As it is an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical evolution through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without consequences.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality for the most severe cases.
Therefore, establishing a predictive model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies conducted so far, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 are as follows (Table 33):
Age: Age was the primary factor for the prognosis of SARS, and this also seems to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects individuals aged 30 to 65, with 47.7% aged over 50 according to a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age of 66 years versus 51 years), thus suggesting age as a prognosis factor for patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and Complications: Patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the leading cause of death among patients with SRAS.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2 positive cholangocytes, which can lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and the presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage; it has been advanced as a potential prognosis factor for disease, treatment response and healing.
The correlation between CRP rate and severity as well as COVID-19 prognosis was also proposed.
In addition, high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine kinase (CK) can also contribute to the prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, including the heart and liver, and are released in the event of tissue damage.
They are thus traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Thoracic X-ray results and timing of clinical symptoms should be examined in conjunction with other elements for the determination of prognosis and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used in supplemental treatment for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since high-dose corticosteroid use has been widely used for severe cases of SRAS, many survivors have experienced avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the administration of steroids to patients with COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and a short duration.
Mental stress: As described above, the COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in a large number of cases of exceptional stress, with patients often experiencing long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty as well as the death of relatives or other patients.
It is imperative to offer long-term psychological support and support to help these individuals overcome this stress and return to a normal life.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SRAS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates effectively in the upper respiratory tract and causes little or no symptoms in the initial phase of infection, like the coronavirus that causes common colds.
As a result, newly infected or in-incubation individuals can produce a large amount of the virus during their daily activities, which significantly impedes control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by seriously ill patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current outbreak of COVID-19 is therefore far more severe and difficult to control than the SARS.
Significant efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighboring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of almost the entire population to stop the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the outbreak.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the decline phase will last for 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimate that COVID-19, which seems to be significantly more infectious than SRAS, will not die out in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian group that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in mid-nosal cornea and throat samples of recovered patients, 2 weeks after they left the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a flu-like cyclic episode.
However, encouraging signs have been observed in China with the gradual decrease in new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
According to preliminary predictions, the Ebola virus is expected to cause up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually put under control.
It is possible, as with SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 will weaken in terms of infectiousness to eventually extinct or that it will evolve into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by coughing or sneezing, and also possibly by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in stools, thus revealing a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients found that 41% of cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous illnesses and 40 healthcare professionals.
Precautions should be taken to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of patients, and even anyone who may be in contact with infected patients or people.
The first possible line of defense to reduce the risk of infection lies in the wear of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (1860) participates in controlling the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposit on surfaces, where they could be passed on to other people.
However, only N95 (1860) masks provide protection against inhalation of virions from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions able to fully penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, as both measure about 85 nm.
Since the particles manage to cross five surgical masks stacked on each other, it is imperative that healthcare professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 (1860s) masks rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare professionals must wear adjusted insulation sweaters to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor found himself infected with SARS-CoV-2 even while wearing a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through the eye due to inflammation.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also wear transparent visors or protective glasses to contact patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended to wash their hands with disinfecting soap more often than usual, stay confined to the maximum and limit any contact with potentially infected people.
It is recommended to maintain a distance of one meter with the sick.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for humans, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as on 7 January 2020, must have placed China in a state of high alert after the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reassured the public that the new virus was low-contagiant, had limited inter-human transmissibility, and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message caused a noticeable relaxation, especially as the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
Chinese disease control agencies need to learn from this and take appropriate action.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, because each word counts and can affect the behavior and decisions of the population; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual clinical data rather than expecting formal reports from doctors or official agencies; (3) be more restrictive to contain a potential outbreak at its onset rather than try to reassure the population; and (4) carry out more targeted and relevant exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases, but also to test and regularly improve the society’s response system.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of this report, it spread to all of China and 50 other countries around the world.
As this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to those of SRAS, the COVID-19 epidemic gives rise to a déjà vu impression.
However, there are notable differences between COVID-19 and SRAS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the outbreak and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; the severity and mortality rates are also higher in older people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10,91% versus 1,44%).
Transmission of COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SARS was mostly transmitted by seriously ill patients, so it is much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and much wider than SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests may be negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, recovered patients may be positive for the virus again.
This significantly increases the risk of spread.
Despite the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, several critical questions remain unresolved, including:
What is SARS-CoV-2?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SRAS-type coronaviruses from mice, this is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 originates from chiropters.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the virus from the original host, for example, turtles, to humans?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively stop the transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modeling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and how does it cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells expressing ACE2 from other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a quick and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during human transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or reappear regularly like the flu?
It is essential, although it may take time, to get answers to all of these questions as well as many others.
However, no matter what costs this may entail, we have no choice but to end this epidemic as soon as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period for these two viruses is less than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
Only a few immunosuppressed patients had severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The first case of SARS dates back to late 2002 in the province of Guangdong, China.
Excluding the supertransmitters, it was estimated that each case could approximately give rise to two secondary cases with an incubation period ranging from 4 to 7 days, with the peak of the viral load appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headaches, fever, discomfort and friction, followed by dyspnea, cough and breathing difficulties as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, false hepatic function tests and elevated creatine kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory tests in case of suspicion of SRAS.
Diffuse alveolar lesions, proliferation of epithelial cells and an increase in macrophages are also observed in patients with SRAS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by a cytokine shock, which can be fatal especially in immunosuppressed patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, elderly people and immunosuppressed patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
The same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in a 71-year-old man hospitalized due to pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present worldwide, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to effectively transmit and maintain continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SRAS and are characterized by acute progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SRAS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MERS compared to HCoV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most deadly viruses known in humans.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been and could contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
The comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the overall trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four Community HCoV (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after transmission to humans, will influence the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
The four community HCoVs causing moderate symptoms adapted well to humans.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
For this to occur, HCoVs must replicate in humans in a sufficient proportion to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for host restrictive factors.
In this view, the more the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people are infected, the more likely it is that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by quarantine or other measures to control infections.
For many years, the four CoVs acquired in community have circulated within the population, triggering a simple cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
In contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and will circulate among them without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of HCoVs.
An animal serves as an evolutionary host of a HCoV if it has a near-ascendant that shares a high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The original virus has often adapted well and is non-pathogenic to its host.
Similarly, a tank host houses the HCoV continuously and long-term.
HCoVs, on the other hand, can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In particular, given that 80% of the animals on the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals can also serve as intermediate amplifier hosts cannot be ruled out.
These mice are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that rats are the hosts of emerging human pathogens.
The human angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite a high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and that mice are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
That’s why mice can’t be the intermediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
Additionally, studies conducted in the Middle East have shown that dromadaires are HIV-positive to specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, just like camels originating in the Middle East present in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only through the respiratory tract, but also through the feces, which is also the main excretion pathway of mice.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than that separating SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoV from pangolin.
Recombination is a common factor in the evolution of beta-CoVs.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have been derived from the CoV of mice, while parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
HCoV-229E, on the other hand, has been genetically associated with another mouse COV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camelids have also been suspected to be intermediate hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was.
The history of species-to-species transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoVs of the rat closely related to HCoV-229E were found.
First, unlike alpaca, men can have contact with mice in a shared ecological niche.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contacts with alpine species.
Then, the alpha-CoV of the calf related to HCoV-229E are numerous and non-pathogenic in the calf, while the alpha-CoV of the alpha caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-CoV of the alpha was not found in wild animals.
In reality, mice are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that calves can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Another possibility is that while mice’s alpha-CoV serves as a genetic reservoir for HCoV-229E, alpages and dromedaries could serve as intermediate hosts transmitting the viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of species-to-species transmission from mice to dromedars and from dromedars to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV found in mice is known through its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedaries for decades.
It has adapted well to those camels who have passed from intermediate host to stable reservoir natural hosts.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several possibilities of species-to-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, mice could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with mice through depeating or coal mining.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts to which a SRAS-CoV-2-related virus has recently been introduced.
Humans get the virus by breeding and eating beef.
It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have taken place within a third species that has been in both contact with calves and pangolins.
Research on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared to other single-string RNA viruses, estimated COV mutation rates could be considered “moderate” to “high” with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year per site, depending on the COV adaptation phase to new hosts.
However, the rate of mutation of CoVs is about a million times higher than that of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when the CoVs have not adapted well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, with a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation in humans.
It can be assumed that it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to dromedaries.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic derivation will make vaccines and antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in the short term.
Third, CoVs randomly and frequently change patterns during RNA replication through a unique “selection-copy” mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found for both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for animal observed CoVs, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction related to transmission
Beyond these three viral factors listed above, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing species-to-species transmission.
SARS-CoV recombination is taken as a typical example here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during species-to-species transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can be key factors in the virus’s adaptation to humans.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of protein S means that the binding affinity of this protein S to human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electronic cryomicroscopy study showed a 10 to 20 times greater affinity of this bond compared to that observed between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different portion of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as N-aminopeptidase for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and HCoV natural reservoir hosts, such as calves, dromedars and rodents, could constitute a barrier to species-to-species transmission.
Emergence of new HCoVs: back to the starting box
The diversity of rat CoVs offers many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, CoVs of calves are genetic reserves of HCoVs.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 was considered important in adaptation to humans, given that SARS-CoV-related mice viruses were isolated but coded divergent ORF8 proteins.
This removal divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is presumed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, in most nsp10 and in some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been demonstrated that the MERS-CoV outbreak has experienced episodes of recombination between different lines, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the calf and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV of the alpha has a simple nucleotide insertion, resulting in a shift in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exercised in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms have been detected when mice were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and mice.
It seemed that the mice had adapted well to the VOCs from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in mice effectively reduce the pathology triggered by COVs.
Additionally, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (DROs) generated by the high metabolic activity of mice could both suppress CoV replication and affect exoribonuclease "relecture", which would create selective pressure and result in highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics intended for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared over the past two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as calves and camels.
They replicate solidly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of observing asymptomatic carriers and what causes cases of severe infection in humans lie.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In the asymptomatic carrier, the immune response was disconnected from the replication of COV.
The same strategy of dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects in treatment for SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the inflammasome NLRP3 fails in mice.
Following this reasoning, NLRP3 inhibition with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a calf beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a calf beta-CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Pangolin beta-CoVs remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
CoVs have returned under fire due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the dromedary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the locals.
They are widely present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as has been done on the wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Various zoonotic COVs circulate in nature.
In particular, the CoVs of chickpeas, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The cultivation of wildlife consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity for infection appears.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of VOCs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing transmission from animal to human and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonoses.
First, if mice transmit a parent SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances mice and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
Second, if mice play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with mice.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of a real intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, mice, and pangolines.
Whether it’s a calf, pangolin or other mammal, one should be able to identify SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical parent viruses seen in their natural hosts.
You can get respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, by not washing your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can be harmful or cause disease.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; and reducing respiratory infections.
Reduce child mortality in home births.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
Pneumonia, one of the leading IRAs, is the leading cause of death among children under five, causing 1.8 million deaths each year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together cause the deaths of 3.5 million children each year.
Hand washing also protects against impétigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor harmful effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing drying.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and common among health workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
Dental cleansing twice a year, combined with daily hand washing with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluoride toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce obstacles to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleanser because lipids and proteins, which are organic materials in the soil, are hardly soluble in water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the skin surfacing and protective agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis by the School of Public Health of the University of Oregon indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
Hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soaped water is more effective than cold and soaped water to remove natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have found that using warm water did not help reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand disinfectant or antiseptic is a non-watery hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances antimicrobial activity.Hand disinfectants containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, flu and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus-type viruses (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand disinfectant or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to wet well or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid elimination activity of microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper handwashing unless you have water and soap at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions can result in drying of the skin if the formula is not enhanced by skin moisturizers and/or moisturizers.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emulsifiers to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emolients caused significantly less irritation and dry skin than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter present on the hands, but only disinfect them.
This is why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the latter remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand disinfectants depends heavily on ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride showed lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness diminishes after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ash or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it risks increasing the spread of diseases rather than curbing it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
Wash your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Spray a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubbing them against each other, not to mention the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Freeze for at least 20 seconds.
The action of rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse abundantly with running water.
Washing in a stagnant pool of water can lead to re-contamination of hands.
Dry with a clean towel or outdoors.
The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, spaces between fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and scaled nail lakes can house microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid having dry hands; dry skin promotes the appearance of skin lesions that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economical alternatives to handwashing when tap water and/or soap are not available.For example, draining water from a suspended and pierced bowl or bowl and/or using ashes if needed, in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as tippy-taps and other economical options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hose suspended using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water onto the hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is debated.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194 percent on the pulp of the fingers and 254 percent on the palms.
Air-jet hand drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the pulp of the fingers by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After drying hands, the following variations in bacterial number were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Handwashing with disinfectant towels is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that send reminders when the hospital staff forgets to wash their hands.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to moisten and rub each part of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the crane (and open the exit door if necessary).
The purpose of handwashing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“bacteria”) and prevent their transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When rinse, it is necessary to prevent water from flowing to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
Regarding the control of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were achieved during the first 20% of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits to increasing the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find hand washing taps near private or public toilets, despite the existence of cost-effective options for building hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can also be attributed to stubborn habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of campaigns to promote hand hygiene that are being carried out to reduce disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of a awareness-raising campaign that claims to foster changing behaviors.After the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
However, one review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to fetid odors called miasmas.
For example, in Germany, posters depicting “good hand washing techniques” have been placed next to drawers in public toilets and in office buildings and airports toilets.
The phrase “washing hands” refers to a person’s refusal to take responsibility or be complicit in something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having this kind of thought are less likely to engage in other compensatory “purification” measures, such as volunteering.
Likewise, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after each meal.

This is the flu season.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to unintentional changes in the genome of viruses, which are most likely due to pressure exercised during selection, in particular by the host’s immune system.
One example is the loss of complete ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E, due to a deletion of two nucleotides.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the calf and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV of the alpha has a simple nucleotide insertion, resulting in a shift in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exercised in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms have been detected when mice were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and mice.
It seemed that the mice had adapted well to the VOCs from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in mice effectively reduce the pathology triggered by COVs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in mice is suppressed by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting the natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low rate of expression of the molecules of the class I major histocompatibility complex.
Additionally, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (DROs) generated by the high metabolic activity of mice could both suppress CoV replication and affect exoribonuclease "relecture", which would create selective pressure and result in highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics intended for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared over the past two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as calves and camels.
They replicate solidly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of observing asymptomatic carriers and what causes cases of severe infection in humans lie.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In the asymptomatic carrier, the immune response was disconnected from the replication of COV.
The same strategy of dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects in treatment for SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is strong in mice.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the inflammasome NLRP3 fails in mice.
Following this reasoning, NLRP3 inhibition with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 appeared following the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a calf beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a calf beta-CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civettes and other animals on the market have been found to be carriers of SARS-CoV-identical viruses, no immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence indicating that SARS-CoV-2 was conceived by humans, whether intentionally or accidentally.
CoVs have returned under fire due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of COVs in calves and other animals has greatly altered our perception of the role zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs play in the transmission of HCoVs to humans.
Numerous factual data have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from mice and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and civettes on the markets, the closure of fresh product markets and the slaughter of civettes there could have effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from fresh product markets to avoid transmission of zoonoses, given the discovery of many lines of pangolins beta-CoV closely linked to SARS-CoV-2
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, if applicable, how this transmission occurs will remain to be determined in subsequent studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the dromedary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the locals.
They are widely present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as has been done on the wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Various zoonotic COVs circulate in nature.
In particular, the CoVs of chickpeas, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
There is no shortage of opportunities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, causing the emergence of new, more transmissible and/or deadly CoVs in humans in the future.
The cultivation of wildlife consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the damage caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan would be needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity for infection appears.
Although mice have many characteristics that favor the spread of viruses, the likelihood for humans to be in contact with mice and other wild species can be minimized if people are aware of the need to stay away.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of VOCs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing transmission from animal to human and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonoses.
The secrets of the zoonotic origin of SRAS-CoV-2 are not yet known.
First, if mice transmit a parent SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances mice and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
Second, if mice play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with mice.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of a real intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, mice, and pangolines.
Finally, given that many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it’s a calf, pangolin or other mammal, one should be able to identify SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical parent viruses seen in their natural hosts.
Future research in this area will help clarify the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have significant implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updated diagnosis criteria for “suspicious” and “confirmed” cases of COVID-19 are needed
On February 6, 2020, our team released a 2019 Rapid Recommendation Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of the New Coronavirus Infection (2019-nCoV) and that guideline described our experience and provided references to combating this global pandemic.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge is progressing gradually based on the results of ongoing studies and the experience of clinical practice; as a result, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this email, we responded to a comment about our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for a “suspicious case” and a “confirmed case” according to the latest COVID-19 (seventh version) diagnostic and treatment guidelines published by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially bears the name coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
To be able to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our knowledge and knowledge is progressing slowly based on the results of ongoing studies and the experience of clinical practice; as a result, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines published by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) have seen a total of seven editions between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, some of which have been substantially modified.
Having received commentary from Zhou et al., these submitted a simple assessment proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has brought new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We appreciate their important work and thank them.
However, their work must also be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (seventh version trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the confirmation of a suspected case must combine one of the characteristic elements of the epidemic history with two elements of clinical manifestations to constitute a comprehensive analysis, or must correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemic history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and neighboring areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been during the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or neighboring areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been during the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a cluster of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases with fever/and respiratory symptoms in the space of 2 weeks in a small area such as home, school, office, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) images showing characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyt count at the onset of symptoms.
Confirmed case diagnosis should be based on the suspected case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire viral genome with strong homogeneity with new known coronaviruses; (3) serological test positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies; or modification of the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody from negative to positive or increase of the title ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to the acute phase.
We can find that real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or in blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic blood sampling screening was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020); then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes rely on researchers’ ongoing work to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory tract samples including blood sampling, with increased availability of different samples, and have helped add the positive specific antibody result to the confirmed criteria.
Moreover, more and more evidence reminds us of caution with regard to atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphic representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified people with no clinical symptoms as “low-risk”.
The evaluation system should also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
In conclusion, we hope for more direct evidence to emerge and we ask readers to submit their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “suspicious cases” and “confirmed cases”, we suggest that they follow and comply with the latest guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our policy in a timely manner to offer their help.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to COVID-19, daily record
Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19-related deaths in a single day.
The country recorded a record number of deaths due to the virus in a single day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Surveillance and Research (IEDCR) that the number of infected people recorded included 114 active cases and 33 people healed, who remained confined at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was always allowed.
On March 19, these three people had already recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from the Johns Hopkins University.
Worldwide, countries have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city’s confinement until May 1.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days; the vote was passed with 215 votes in favor, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronavirus
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the trend to reveal how devastating and potentially fatal a HCoV infection could be.
Most HCoVs come from mice in which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate tank hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
Identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of CoV-host interactions in animals could also help to better understand CoV in humans.
According to the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genres (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The beta-CoV genus contains the majority of HCoVs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Philogenetic evidence has shown that calves and rodents play the role of genetic source for most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The tracing of zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for understanding natural history, driving forces and restrictive factors of species barrier crossing.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the host(s) reservoir, intermediary and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in preventing future infections.
Animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Over the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated in the respiratory tract of patients with an upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and subsequently adapted to grow in WI-38 pulmonary cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of the common cold, including headache, sneezing, nausea and sore throat, with fever and cough observed in 10 to 20% of cases.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both present worldwide and appear to be transmitted mainly in winter, in temperate climate countries.
Australian stores reduce quantities of toilet paper per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their restrictions on buying toilet paper to two and one package per purchase in all stores nationwide, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a limit of one package.
These limits were displayed in the form of messages to the boxes and on the channels’ Facebook pages.
Buyers seemed to build up reserves for fear of COVID-19 and the need to confined themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted toilet paper purchases for home deliveries to one package per order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, said that with the restriction on four packages in force, “many stores are still out of stock in the hour after delivery,” and called the demand “unprecedented,” while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it “unexpected.”
Sales experienced a “strong increase” last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed to two packages last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI made stock available earlier for a promotion scheduled for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local council restrictions on truck delivery times make the task difficult.
It predicts an increase in production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early unlocking of stocks, some stores are unable to honor the Wednesday promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a distribution industry expert at Queensland University of Technology, explained that stores refuel stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a voluminous item, resulting in stocks of a reduced amount that, once exhausted, leave large spaces empty in rays, reinforcing the impression of a shortage.
“Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the rays are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [bought] and are available in large quantities, it will probably reduce panic,” Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which manufactures Sorbent paper, pointed out that they are working 24/7 to maintain supply, according to the News.com.au article.
Domain.com, a real estate website, said some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were organized because buyers were on vacation during the long Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a Darwin-printed newspaper, included an eight-page envelope intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 report by ABC Australia in which they announced that they were not planning to introduce purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside of Australia, it was observed Sunday evening that the UK online supermarket Ocado limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the current outbreak of COVID-19 (the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus) a pandemic.
Although the word “pandemic” refers only to the extent to which the disease is spread, and not to the danger of specific cases, the WHO has pointed out the need to push governments to take action:
“Every country can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations as part of the response,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
“We are deeply concerned, not only by the alarming levels of spread and severity, but also by the alarming levels of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
He said, in a statement published by CNN in February, that “except for the flu, no other respiratory virus has been observed since its appearance until its continued spread worldwide.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, stating that “we have never witnessed a coronavirus-induced pandemic.”
He added: “And we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.”
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
Director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the epidemic: “To put it short, the situation will get worse.”
On Thursday, the Associated Press that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing coronavirus disease outbreak since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people were healed.
The mortality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while in the rest of the world it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering your mouth for coughing, staying away from other people, as well as monitoring and confining people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world reacted by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, fire cover, workplace risk controls and establishment closures.
The pandemic has caused serious socio-economic disruptions worldwide, postponement or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages aggravated by panic shopping.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the world’s student population.
Fake information about the virus has circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of East and Southeast Asian origin and appearance, as well as other people from regions with numerous cases of the virus.
Due to the decrease in travel and closures in the heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) an outbreak of unknown-cause pneumonia on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was opened in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the Huanan wholesale seafood market and so the virus is thought to be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely linked to turtle coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first known person to have symptoms fell ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no obvious connection to the subsequent foci of the fresh product market.
Of the first cases in December 2019, two-thirds were linked to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unchecked report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could date back to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old person from the province of Hubei.On February 26, 2020, the WHO that as new cases appeared to decrease in China but suddenly increase in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside of China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a strong underestimation of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
On February 26, relatively few cases had been among young people, those aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. UK Chief Scientific Advisor Patrick Vallance estimated that 60% of the UK population had to be infected before they could effective collective immunity.
Cases refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test those with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that up to January 23, 86 percent of undetected COVID-19 infections were estimated in China, and that these unrecorded infections were the source of infection in 79 percent of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the cases.
Initial estimates of COVID-19’s baseline reproduction rate (R0) were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are healed.
For those who do not heal, the interval between the onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, approximately 80 percent of deaths were in the age of 60 and over, and 75 percent suffered from pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.The official COVID-19 pandemic death count generally refers to people who have been tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual number of COVID-19 victims could be much higher, as it might not include untested deaths – e.g. at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy reveal that the figures of overmortality during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged “We know [the number of deaths] is underestimated,” a statement confirmed by anecdotal undervaluation reports in the U.S. Such underestimation often occurs during pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.
The first deaths outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first deaths outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
On February 28, more than a dozen deaths per country were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On March 13, more than forty countries and territories deaths on all continents except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by region and time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the healthcare system, therapeutic options, the time passed since the outbreak began, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and especially health.
According to statistics from Johns-Hopkins University, the global case-to-death ratio is 6.0% (97.039/1 617 204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the case-to-death ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms occurring between 1st and 10th January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms occurring after 1st February 2020).The other indicators are the mortality rate (fatality rate), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease and the infection rate (infection rate), which represents the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who succeed to a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have attempted to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates the infection rate for the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the impact of the tests on estimates of mortality.
The WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said: “Without control, infectious outbreaks usually stabilize and then begin to regress when the disease comes to lack of available hosts.
But it’s almost impossible to make relevant predictions at the moment about when this will happen.”
China’s chief medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, said that “this could be completed by June” if all countries managed to mobilize to follow WHO’s recommendations on measures to halt the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 “will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two.”
According to an Imperial College study conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be needed “until a vaccine is available (possibly in 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: “I think it’s unlikely that this coronavirus—because it’s very easily transmitted—will disappear completely” and that it “could turn into a seasonal disease, likely to reappear every year.”
The virulence of this return would depend on the collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosity), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headaches, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis. The WHO says that about one in six people is seriously ill and has breathing difficulties.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognises emergency symptoms such as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficult awakening, and bleak face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm the infection, so the researchers have issued recommendations that people who have had close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to exclude the risk of infection.
Chinese assessments of the asymptomatic ratio range from a few to 44 percent.
The usual incubation period (the time between the infection and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is most often five days.A good example of uncertainty, the estimated proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their smell was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is believed to be transmitted mainly through close contact and through thin droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or speaking; this close contact corresponding to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without protecting can project droplets from a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus could also be transmitted through thin droplets that would remain in the air for longer periods, which could be projected by speaking.
Postillons can land in the mouth or nose of other people nearby or even be inhaled into the lungs.
Certain medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and thus result in aerial propagation.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it can be transmitted through the stool, this risk is considered to be low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, however spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in advanced stages of the disease.
People were tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible before the development of significant symptoms.
Only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected by some countries during contact research surveys.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three others.
The virus was detected after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, after one day on cardboard, and after four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but British authorities recommend washing hands after touching animals, such as after being in contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia linked to the focus of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside of the human body, the virus is destroyed by home soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be of zoonotic origin.
A genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus genetically belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, the subgenre Sarbecovirus (line B) associated with two strains from mice.
It is 96% identical to the entire genome of another sample of turtle coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between pangolines-borne viruses and human-borne viruses.
Comparison of the entire genome has so far revealed a maximum of 92% genetic material common between the pangolins coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however final confirmation is made by reverse transcription of polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or scanner.
A study comparing PCR and the scanner in Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less accurate, because many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonia and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that “the scanner should not be used for screening or as a first intention test to diagnose COVID-19.”
The WHO has released several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on January 17.
The test uses the reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours or days.
Usually this test is performed on a rhinopharynx sample but a throat sample can also be used. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them proved reliable enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic imaging elements on X-rays and scanning of people with symptoms include asymmetric peripheral glass opacities and the absence of pleural blur.
The Italian Society of Radiology currently provides an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed PCR imaging is of limited accuracy to detect COVID-19.
A major study in China compared the results of chest scanners with PCR and demonstrated that while imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, advocating its use as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutionary neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect virus characteristics in imaging on both X-rays and scanners.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include having overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a towel and then throwing the towel directly into a garbage bag.
Those who were previously infected were advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
A number of governments have banned or discouraged all non-essential travel to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
Nevertheless, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in vast areas of the planet.
This means that the virus is spreading across communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been infected. Health professionals who care for someone who may be infected are advised to take the usual precautions as well as contact precautions, and wear protective glasses. Searching for contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments in this regard has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits to such surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been launched or proposed on a voluntary basis, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user’s presence near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, but many organizations are currently working on developing one.
It is recommended to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after wet, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended using a alcohol-based hand disinfectant with a volume of at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not easily accessible.
The WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated in several ways (in one minute of exposure to disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62–71 %, isopropanol at 50–100 %, sodium hypochlorite at 0,1 %, hydrogen peroxide at 0,5 % and iodized povidon at 0,2–7,5 %.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office building or nursery, all rooms such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and automatic distributors used by sick people, be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with their folded elbow or a towel when they cough or sneeze, and throw away any towel immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance traveled by the projected postillons by speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions that explain where and when to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “Wearing a mask can reduce people’s propensity to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiene.”
The WHO has recommended wearing masks to healthy people only if they face a significant risk, for example if they care for a patient with COVID-19, even though it recognizes that wearing the mask can help people not touch their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage their people to wear masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical tissue masks. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks to healthy people, especially in case of proximity (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transportation or crowded places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage people to make facial masks at home and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned going out in public without a mask or other means to cover the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam imposed the wearing of masks on everyone in public places, so that everyone can protect themselves and protect others.
The Austrian government has ordered everyone entering a supermarket to wear a mask.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks per day since mid-March, imposed the mask on passengers on inter-city trains and buses on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask for every exit, while recommending the manufacture of a handmade mask to those who cannot buy it.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical distancing) includes measures to control infections designed to slow the spread of the disease by reducing contact between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and shutdown of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centers.
The methods of social distancing can be applied by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowds, greeting one another without contact, and keeping a physical distance from others.
Many governments are now ordering or recommending social detachment in the regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of assemblies recommended by U.S. government and health agencies was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension or a weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious illness and complications. Thus, they were asked by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in the areas affected by the epidemic. By the end of March 2020, the WHO and other health organizations began to replace the term “social distance” with “physical distance” to clarify the goal of reducing physical contact byining social ties, whether virtually or by keeping a distance.
The use of the term “social detachment” meant that it was necessary to resort to total social isolation, instead of encouraging people to keep in touch with others through other means.
They include the recommendation to have sex only with a person with whom you live, who does not have the virus or has no symptoms.
Home isolation has been recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who think they are infected.
Health organizations have issued detailed instructions for proper isolation.Many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to people in the most at-risk groups.
People who have been exposed to a patient with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region where the transmission is very high were asked to be placed in quarantine for 14 days from the time they could have been exposed for the last time.
The strategies for controlling an epidemic are endurance or suppression, and mitigation.
Staging is set up in the early stages of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected people, as well as to introduce other measures of infection control and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are turned to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow this spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.
Reduction and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
Elimination requires more extreme measures, in order to influence the pandemic by reducing the base reproduction number to less than 1.A part of managing an epidemic of infectious disease is to try to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is what is called flat the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overload of health services and saves time for vaccine development and treatment.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and individual quarantine; public social distancing measures such as shutting down schools and religious offices; a public effort to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental actions such as cleaning surfaces.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued warnings about displacement of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to infected people who put themselves in quarantine, and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and sanctioned the seizure of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing down but not eliminating the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the development of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce health care demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but cannot avoid hundreds of thousands of deaths, and healthcare systems are overwhelmed.
Removal may be preferred, but it must continue as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it happens first), because otherwise transmission will rebound rapidly when measures are released.
The long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing treatments.
Taking non-prescription cold medications or drinking drinks as well as resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
Steroid use can worsen the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO has said that some “traditional and handicraft remedies” can ease the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity and adapting health care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 is described by the WHO as a fundamental measure of response to the epidemic.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for resource redistribution at various levels, including dedicating laboratory services to COVID-19 testing, canceling non-urgent interventions where possible, separating and isolating patients tested positive for COVID-19 and strengthening intensive care capacities through staff training and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are various theories about the origin of the very first case (called zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus may date back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
In a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has gradually increased.
They are generally linked to the Huanan wholesale seafood market, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. An unknown cause of pneumonia was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a “SARS-like coronavirus.”
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were criticized by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was criticized by his superiors for giving the alert.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia to the Wuhan health authorities to trigger an investigation in early January.In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled roughly every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by Chinese New Year's migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a major transport hub as well as a major railway correspondence site.
On January 20, China 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 were cured.
About 200 countries and territories had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries have restricted travel and introduced border controls.
National reactions included restraining measures such as quarantine (also called orders to stay at home, shelter or confinement) and fire cover. As of April 2, 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are subject to some form of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide experienced some form of confinement, a figure rising to 2.6 billion two days later — about a third of the world’s population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the very first case would date back to November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a fever of cases of unknown cause pneumonia on December 26, which she to Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Initial genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public opinion was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The WHO was informed the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan have been warned for “sparing rumors” about the epidemic.
China's National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "evident evidence" of transmission between humans.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping as a “people’s war” to halt the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as “the largest quarantine in human history,” a sanitary cord was announced on January 23 to stop travel from and to Wuhan, which has been extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) have been cancelled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was later built: Leishenshan, to treat additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China has converted 14 other structures in Wuhan, such as congress centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.On January 26, the government introduced new measures to curb the COVID-19 epidemic, including issuing health statements for travellers and extending the Spring holiday holidays.
Universities and schools in the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have introduced a number of measures, with regard to schools and universities.
Distance work measures have been introduced in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions have been adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transportation has been changed and Chinese museums have been temporarily closed.
Population displacement control has been applied in many cities, and it has been estimated that approximately 760 million people (more than half the population) have dealt with some form of travel restriction.After the epidemic entered the global stage in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being “imported” from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day quarantine for all international travellers entering the city.On March 23, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted inside the country in the previous five days, in this case through a traveller returning to Canton from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Prime Minister Li Keqiang said that the spread of cases transmitted inside the country was essentially blocked, and that the epidemic was controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, with the exception of Wuhan, two months after the detention began. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for holders of a visa or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March, without specifying when this policy would end.
Those who wish to enter China must apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
The state affairs council announced a day of mourning to begin with three minutes of silence on April 4 at 10 p.m., which coincides with Qingming Day, although the central government has asked families to pay tribute online to respect physical distance and avoid a resumption of the COVID-19 epidemic.
It has been confirmed that COVID-19 spread to South Korea on January 20, 2020 from China.
The nation’s health agency a considerable increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji followers who visited Daegu from Wuhan were suspected to have been at the origin of the epidemic.
On February 22, 1,261 or approximately 13% of the church’s 9,336 members symptoms.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were in Korea, followed by 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were placed in quarantine after three soldiers were tested positive for the virus.
South Korea has introduced what was considered to be the world’s largest and best organized program to test the population for the virus, and isolate all infected people as well as track and quarantine people who have been in contact with them.
The screening methods included mandatory individual symptom reporting by international newcomers via a mobile app, virus screening drives delivering results the next day, and increased test capacity to allow testing of 20,000 people every day.
The South Korean program is considered a success in controlling the epidemic, although it has not quarantined entire cities.The South Korean society was initially divided about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be accused of mismanagement of the epidemic by the government, or on the contrary praising his reaction.
On March 23, South Korea experienced the lowest number of daily cases in four weeks.
On March 29, it was announced that from April 1, all those coming from abroad would be placed in quarantine for two weeks.

The WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and enduring the epidemic.
The WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic, where Chinese authorities were accused of concealment that hindered prevention and endurance efforts, and the current crisis where the central government “provided regular reports to avoid panic on the eve of the Lunar New Year.”
On 23 January, in response to the central authorities’ decision to impose a travel ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that although it was “certainly not a WHO recommendation”, it was, however, a “very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated” and he spoke of a fact “unprecedented in the history of public health”.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the USPPI was due to the “risk of global spread, for low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros said “there is no reason for measures to unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade” and “the WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel.”
On February 5, the WHO called on the international community to contribute $675 million to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgent need to support those countries that “do not have the necessary systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it was about to appear.”
Tedros then said that we are “as strong as our weakest link” and urged the international community to “invest today or pay more tomorrow.”
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to integrate “the force of the entire United Nations system in the response.”
A UN crisis management team has thus been activated, allowing to coordinate the entire UN response, which according to the WHO will enable them to “focus on the health response while other agencies will be able to bring their expertise to manage the broader social, economic and development implications of the epidemic.”
On February 14, a joint WHO-led mission team was activated in China to send international and WHO experts on-site to China to support national management and evaluate “the severity and transmission of the disease” by organizing workshops and meetings with key national institutions and conducting field visits to assess “the impact of response activities at the provincial and county level, including in urban and rural settings.”

This virus may be on the way and you need to be prepared,” adding that the right response could help the world avoid “the worst.”
Ryan then said that current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, adding that such a statement would mean that “we absolutely accept that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus.”
On March 11, the World Health Organization declared that the coronavirus outbreak could be called a pandemic.
The director-general said that the WHO was “extremely concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction.”The WHO has faced significant criticism over its inadequate management of the pandemic, due to the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.

Several provincial administrators of the Communist Party of China (CCP) have been removed from their duties following their management of quarantine in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of political leaders to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe this action was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping from popular anger over the coronavirus epidemic.
Some senior Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected the initial idea that the coronavirus outbreak had begun in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories that COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump has called the coronavirus “Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus”, stating that in China “censorship has overfuelled a virus that has now become a global pandemic”, which was later taxed as racism by some opponents and intended to “distract attention from the inability of its administration to contain the disease.”
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. government outlining the main lines of a communication scheme apparently from the National Security Council, whose strategy is as follows: “Everything comes from China.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there was “a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and the “politics of generosity.”
Borrell also said that “China aggressively insists that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”

The source accused Russia of embarking on an offensive of "geopolitical and diplomatic charm".
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia has also sent a cargo aircraft loaded with medical assistance to the United States.

This has also resulted in a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide and the WHO warns that this will put health professionals at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has offered a new opportunity for daigos to sell Australian products to China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the high demand for food products that followed, these two areas were spared by severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been a real success, avoiding the serious food shortages that had been foreseen in Europe and North America.
Thanks to its large agricultural output, Northern Italy has not seen a significant decline, but prices could rise, according to industry representatives.
Food rays were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, as members of the Chinese government unblocked pork reserves to ensure sufficient livelihoods for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy so that food producers store reserves for such emergencies.

Support has been provided to the Chinese, whether online or offline, and to the inhabitants of areas affected by the virus.
As the outbreak spreads to new sensitive countries, Italians, the first country in Europe to suffer from a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to ban Chinese citizens from entering their country in order to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has raised anger on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians living in the UK and the United States have an increase in levels of racist insults, as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a “Chinese virus,” a term considered by his critics to be racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign displaced persons between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, and students in major Indian cities were allegedly harassed in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
Bharatiya Janata Party West Bengal unit chairman Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and “that’s why God took revenge on them.”
The remarks were subsequently condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which described them as “false”.In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents were fuelled by the pandemic, with foreigners described as “foreign waste” that should be “eliminated”.
Many paid-access newspapers have removed them for all or part of their coverage on the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made available their scientific articles related to the epidemic in open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their findings quickly on pre-publishing servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory screening for respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the virus and detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Anticorps detection (serology) can be used both for population diagnosis and monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have contracted the disease, including those whose symptoms were too mild to be or those asymptomatic.
The exact disease mortality rate and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests performed in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect mortality rates, which are likely to be substantially overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerization chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be carried out on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including nasopharyngeal shell or sputum sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test from pharyngeal shells is reliable only during the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus can disappear from the throat while continuing to multiply in the lungs.
In infected people tested during the second week, a sample can also be taken from the deep respiratory tract via an aspiration catheter, or a sputum (expectoration) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using reverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerization chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and was the basis for 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-grade SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It detects the “E” gene shared by all beta-coronaviruses, and the SARS-CoV-2-specific RdRp gene.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use authorization from the Chinese National Administration of Medical Products for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute their real-time RT-PCR diagnostics device for the new 2019 (2019-nCoV) coronavirus to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
Among the older versions of the test kits, one in three genetic tests obtained unsuccessful results due to faulty reagents, as well as a clogging job of testing at the Atlanta CDC. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only then that federal and local laboratories were authorized to start screening.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use permit.U.S. commercial laboratories started screening in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 tests.
Quest Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitation has been announced. Sampling and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Center for Research in Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a COVID-19 infection detection test.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be carried out in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing a device to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (US) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott’s m2000 system.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an EEA from the FDA for a test taking about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can deliver positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
A test using a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, hoping to provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, such as a quick flu test.
A bibliographic study in March 2020 concluded that “pulmonary X-rays have a low diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of TDM [tomodensitometry] may be conclusive even before symptoms appear.”
Among the typical symptoms visible on DMT are bilateral, multi-lobular opacities of depolished glass with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Subpleural predominance, crazy paving and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to TDM in Wuhan, at the starting point of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less accurate, with many of its imaging results coinciding with other pneumonia and diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “DMT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.”In March 2020, CDCs recommend PCR for initial screening.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and as part of population monitoring.Tests can be performed in central laboratories (TLC) or by point-of-care testing (PoCT).
The high-speed automated systems of many clinical laboratories are able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For TLC, a single peripheral blood sample is usually used, although serial samples can be used to track the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually taken by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction steps are required before analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that duly informed the agency and which, therefore, can now distribute their antibody screening tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency use permit.At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is significantly faster than the PCR test of viral RNA.
The antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the onset of the infection.In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody testing kits purchased by the country was performing enough to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan under which suspicious cases can remain at home, “the emergency service will provide the patient with a sample tube,” patients spit inside, send it back and receive the test result later.The UK NHS has announced that it is conducting a pilot project to test suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient infecting others by going to a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance in case of use.As part of the COVID-19 drive-test for suspicious cases, a healthcare professional takes a sample by taking the appropriate precautions.
In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Doctors said on March 2 that it had the ability to perform approximately 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient environment, and that 10,700 patients had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are covered by health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, drive-tests were available in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are.
A first laboratory study found that in the calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested until the week 12/2020 included and that 33,491 samples (6.9%) had a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for analyzing samples from 64 patients at a time, grouping the samples and conducting screening only if the combined sample turned out to be positive.At Wuhan, an improvised 2,000-square-meter emergency detection laboratory called “Huo-Yan” (Chinese: 火, “Fire Eye”) was opened on February 5, 2020, and could process more than 10,000 elions per day.
Thanks to its construction in 5 days supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian, the modeling revealed that cases in Hubei province would have been 47% higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capability.
The Wuhan laboratory was soon followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in 12 Chinese cities in total.
By March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day.Free multiplexed models developed by Origami Assays have been released to test up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests.
In March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagent became a clutter for mass screening in the EU, the UK and the United States.
This situation has prompted some authors to examine sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes in order to continue screening.On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates are now the country testing most of its population per capita for Coronavirus, and were about to intensify screening to reach the majority of the population.
These results were achieved through a combination of the ability to conduct drive-tests and the purchase of a population-wide broadband laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operational outside of China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula to manufacture kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was released on 17 January 2020.The protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was only released on 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the U.S. China and the U.S. had problems with the reliability of test kits at the start of the epidemic, and these countries, along with Australia, were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demand and recommendations for screening from health professionals.
Experts, on the other hand, say the high availability of tests in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
Screening capabilities, largely in private-sector laboratories, have been strengthened over the years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization recommended intensifying screening programs as the best way to slow the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private U.S. laboratories, and the reserves of eucalyptus and chemical reagents have exhausted.
In March 2020, China problems with the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects".The government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that hindered private testing.Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were not reliable.
The company explained that the wrong results could be related to the inability to collect samples or use kits properly.
The Spanish Ministry said it would remove the kits that gave the wrong results, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased from China by the Czech Republic provided false results.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested throwing them into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a “high error rate” and that it did not “use” them.
The screening, followed by the quarantine of those who obtained a positive result and the tracking of people who had been in contact with SARS-CoV-2 carriers, yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first COVID-19-related deaths in Italy, conducted two series of tests on the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
Nearly half of those who obtained a positive result had no symptoms, and all cases discovered were placed in quarantine.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this measure completely eliminated new infections.
Thanks to aggressive contact tracking, travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much less rapidly than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened on the scheduled holiday end date on March 23.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic using aggressive contact tracking, travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive confinements, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that performed the most tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are better able to detect people with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries without analytical capacity and whose national laboratories have only limited experience with COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of WHO’s 16 reference laboratories for confirmation tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column “Positive in % of tests” depends on the national screening policy.
A country that tests only those admitted to the hospital will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, the other factors being the same.
Hand washing, also called hand hygiene, refers to cleaning your hands to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The fact of systematically washing your hands with soap at certain “key moments” of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted orofecularly.
You can get respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, by not washing your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day: before and after the defecation, after cleaning a baby’s buttocks or changing the sheath, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you do not have soap or water in your hands, you can wash your hands with ashes.The World Health Organization recommends that you wash your hands:
Before, during and after the preparation of meals.
Before and after taking care of a sick person
after changing the beds of a baby or cleaning a child who went to the toilet;
after swallowing or coughing;
after touching an animal, feed or waste of animal origin;
Hand hygiene in the medical environment refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can be harmful or cause disease.
This practice is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; and reducing respiratory infections.
Reduce child mortality in home births.
According to a 2013 study, improving hand hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in growth in children under five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple practice can reduce the death rate associated with these diseases by 50%.
Implementing actions to promote hand washing could reduce episodes of diarrhea by about a third, a figure comparable to that achieved by supplying clean drinking water to low-income regions.
Washing hands with soap reduces the risk of diarrhea by 48% and is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (AIR).
Pneumonia, one of the leading IRAs, is the leading cause of death among children under five, causing 1.8 million deaths each year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together cause the deaths of 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, taking the habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce diarrhea-related deaths by almost half and acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitary measures within the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impétigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor harmful effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing drying.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and common among health workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day to reduce the transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilet (wiping, defecation), after cleaning a baby’s buttocks (or changing his legs), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Hands should also be washed properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, in particular before and after treating a cut or injury, after sneezing, coughing or wet, after touching animal waste or handling animals and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is low.
According to a 2015 study of 54 countries on hand hygiene, an average of 38.7% of households washed their hands with soap. A 2014 study found that it was Saudi Arabia that had the highest rate (97%), the United States was in the middle of the table (77%) and China had the lowest rate (23%). Today there are several methods to change behavior and democratize the use of soap for hand washing at key times of the day.
As an example, the Philippine Ministry of Education has implemented a “Primary Health Care Program” to promote children’s health and education.
Dental cleansing twice a year, combined with daily hand washing with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluoride toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better eliminate the microorganisms present on the skin, soaps or detergents should be added to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce obstacles to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleanser because lipids and proteins, which are organic materials in the soil, are hardly soluble in water.
Adequate water flow facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria are rinse with foam.
However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that “automatic liquid soap distributors are preferred.”
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly recommended to people concerned about their health.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, to which many strains of organisms resist.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the skin surfacing and protective agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis by the School of Public Health of the University of Oregon indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
Hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soaped water is more effective than cold and soaped water to remove natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have found that using warm water did not help reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand disinfectant or antiseptic is a non-watery hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based non-aqueous hand hygiene products (currently called hydroalcoholic solutions, antiseptic solutions for hands or hand disinfectants) began to gain popularity.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances antimicrobial activity.Hand disinfectants containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, flu and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (3.5 log reduction, 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4.5 log reduction) of bacteria on the hands 1 minute after application.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus-type viruses (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand disinfectant or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to wet well or cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands, as well as the interstits between the fingers and nails, should be frozen for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or gel dries out.
The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands instead of using hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid elimination activity of microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper handwashing unless you have water and soap at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions can result in drying of the skin if the formula is not enhanced by skin moisturizers and/or moisturizers.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emulsifiers to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emolients caused significantly less irritation and dry skin than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritating contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than washing hands with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter present on the hands, but only disinfect them.
This is why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the latter remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand disinfectants depends heavily on ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride showed lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness diminishes after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Among low-income populations, many are those who do not have the means to buy soap, and instead use ashes or soil.
Ash or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it risks increasing the spread of diseases rather than curbing it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends proper hand washing to prevent disease transmission, following the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Spray a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubbing them against each other, not to mention the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Freeze for at least 20 seconds.
The action of rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse abundantly with running water.
Washing in a stagnant pool of water can lead to re-contamination of hands.
Dry with a clean towel or outdoors.
The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, spaces between fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and scaled nail lakes can house microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid having dry hands; dry skin promotes the appearance of skin lesions that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economical alternatives to handwashing when tap water and/or soap are not available.For example, draining water from a suspended and pierced bowl or bowl and/or using ashes if needed, in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as tippy-taps and other economical options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hose suspended using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water onto the hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is debated.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
In 2008, a paper dryer industry-funded study, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (London), to compare the hygiene levels offered by more modern paper towels, hot air hand dryers and air-jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194 percent on the pulp of the fingers and 254 percent on the palms.
Air-jet hand drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the pulp of the fingers by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the pulp of fingers and up to 77% on the palms.The scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a potential for cross-contamination with other toilet users and the toilet environment depending on each drying method.
The air-jet hand dryer, which blows air out of the device at advertised speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to expel microorganisms from the hands and the device and possibly contaminate other toilet users and the toilet environment in a perimeter of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot air hand dryer allows the spread of microorganisms at a maximum distance of 0.25 meters from the hand dryer.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of drying hands were evaluated.
After drying hands, the following variations in bacterial number were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Handwashing with disinfectant towels is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing in medical settings became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in hospital settings.
There are electronic devices that send reminders when the hospital staff forgets to wash their hands.
One study found that their use resulted in a decrease in infection rates.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to moisten and rub each part of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
In case of residues under the nails, it is possible to use a fur brush to remove them.
Since the germs present in the water are likely to stay on your hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the crane (and open the exit door if necessary).
This helps to prevent re-contamination of hands when they come into contact with surfaces.
The purpose of handwashing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“bacteria”) and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the inadequate rate of hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical establishments, with a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, proper handwashing and following other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66%.The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure to follow for handwashing and rubbing in the field of health.
The Organization’s draft hand hygiene guidelines can also be consulted on the website to collect feedback from Internet users.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercially available devices can measure and certify hand hygiene, if compliance with regulations is proven.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined five main guidelines for hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
After having had contact with the patient, adding antiseptic chemicals to soap (soap "drug" or "antimicrobial") provides the handwashing agent with an action that destroys germs.
It is desirable to remove these germs before performing surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very widespread. To "wash" hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a crane that can be opened and closed without touching it with hands, a chlorhexidine or iodine washing product, sterile towels for drying hands after washing them, a sterile brush for rubbing and another sterile instrument for cleaning under the nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to rub your hands for 10 minutes.
When rinse, it is necessary to prevent water from flowing to the hands.
After washing your hands, you should dry your hands with sterile clothes and wear a surgical cascade.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
Regarding the control of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were achieved during the first 20% of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits to increasing the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
If we compare handwashing with regular soap to antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, when we compare handwashing with an alcohol solution and handwashing with antibacterial soap for an average duration of 30 seconds each, we found that the first reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the second.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products in reducing the influenza A (H1N1) virus and Clostridium difficile spores present on the hands. In order to improve hand hygiene in healthcare institutions, it is possible, among other things, to train staff on hand washing, to put more alcohol-based products at their disposal and to send written and verbal reminders about this.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered to be an inexpensive and essential tool for preserving health and even eating properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or facilities to wash hands at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to universal hand hygiene habits.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find hand washing taps near private or public toilets, despite the existence of cost-effective options for building hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can also be attributed to stubborn habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting hand washing with soap and carrying out awareness-raising activities can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of this practice and lead to long-term behavioral change in the population.
In order for this to be successful, monitoring and evaluation activities are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that local approaches are effective in increasing the rate of handwashing in low- and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. When it comes to promoting handwashing in schools, one can quote the example of the UNICEF “Three Star Approach”, which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap while complying with other hygiene rules.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of campaigns to promote hand hygiene that are being carried out to reduce disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of a awareness-raising campaign that claims to foster changing behaviors.After the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
Few studies have looked at the overall cost-effectiveness ratio of handwashing in developing countries compared to the number of years of healthy life earned (i.e. DALY avoided).
However, one review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations such as newborn mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British “founder of modern nursing.”
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to fetid odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and nosocomial infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The rise of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to greater awareness in many countries about the need to wash hands with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters depicting “good hand washing techniques” have been placed next to drawers in public toilets and in office buildings and airports toilets.
The phrase “washing hands” refers to a person’s refusal to take responsibility or be complicit in something.
It is derived from a Bible verse in Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth undertakes to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, a symbol of her bad conscience in view of the crimes she committed and urged her husband to commit.
It has also been found that some people, after remembering or considering committing unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others and attach more value to hand washing devices.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having this kind of thought are less likely to engage in other compensatory “purification” measures, such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe handwashing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing, which consists of using water rather than soap to wash hands, is part of the handwashing rituals promoted in many religions, including Baha'i and Hinduism, immersion (tevilah) and ritual ablution of hands (Netilat Yadayim) in Judaism, laundry in Christianity and wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe handwashing for hygienic purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands after going to the toilet.
Likewise, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after each meal.
Risk controls for COVID-19 at work
COVID-19 risk control at work refers to the implementation of workplace health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace risk controls vary by workplace and tasks, based on an assessment of the risks of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.In this case, only basic prevention measures against infection are recommended, including handwashing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory label andining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Work with medium exposure risk includes those requiring frequent or close contact with people without COVID-19 suspected or known, but who may be infected as a result of ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, in schools, high-population working environments and some large-volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation using highly efficient air filters, sanitary windows and the provision of personal protective equipment in case of encounter with a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to people with suspected or known COVID-19 as presenting a high risk of exposure, rising to a very high risk if they perform aerosol-producing procedures or samples or manipulations of people with suspected or known COVID-19.
Appropriate risk controls for such workers shall include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen ill, need to take care of other people or fear possible exposure.
Business models can change, both in terms of the goods requested and the means of acquiring them (including shopping outside of peak hours or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, shipment of items from geographical regions severely affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. A plan for preparation and response to infectious diseases can be used as a guide for protective measures.
Plans take into account the risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors related to family and community backgrounds and individual workers’ risk factors such as old age or chronic diseases.
They also outline the necessary controls to deal with these risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Preparedness and response plans for infectious diseases may be the subject of national or regional recommendations.
Epidemic response targets include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk of medical complications,ining business operations and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The risk control hierarchy forms a framework generally used in occupational health and safety to group risk controls by effectiveness.
When the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical checks, followed by administrative checks and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Technical controls involve isolating employees from work-related risks without having to rely on the behavior of workers.
Administrative controls refer to changes in policies or procedures at work that require action from the worker or employer.
Individual protective equipment (IPE) is considered to be less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may help prevent certain exposures.
All types of EPIs must be selected according to the risk to the worker, properly adapted to the needs (e.g. respiratory masks), properly and systematically worn, regularly inspected,ined and replaced as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
The basic prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and careful hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory labeling, including covering their mouth and nose for coughing and sneezing, providing towels and garbage bags, preparing for remote work or scheduled working hours as needed, deterring workers from using other people’s tools and equipment, andining routine cleaning and disinfection of the workplace.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious people is a crucial step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others at a workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay at home until they have no fever, fever signs or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using febrifuges or other medications acting on symptoms. They also advise to apply flexible sick leave policies, allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and inform employees of these policies.
According to the OSHA, jobs at average exposure risk include those that require frequent or close contact, less than six feet (1,8 m) away, with people without COVID-19 suspected or known, but who may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to an ongoing community transmission around the company headquarters or because the person has recently made an international trip to a region with widespread transmission of COVID-19.
This can include the protection of workers on the high-risk level, in schools, high-density working environments and some high-volume retail work environments. Technical controls for this group or the high-risk group may include the installation of highly efficient air filters, the increase of ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as in-person meetings with transparent plastic glasses and the establishment of individual drive protection hours for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and those at high-risk include the installation of highly efficient air filters, the encouragement of sick workers to stay at home, the replacement of personal meetings with virtual communications, the establishment of individual drive protection hours for customer service, the interruption of other non-essential journeys of the regulatory versions of COV-19 epidemics, including the development of an active face-washing equipment and a worker’s measure of protection, in particular for the use of an OV-1 forum and for a worker’s needs, and for the use of an OV-1 form,
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respiratory masks.
If a person falls ill on board an airplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following measures: separate the sick person from others by a distance of 6 feet, appoint a crew member to take care of the sick person and offer a protective mask to the sick person or ask him to cover his mouth and nose with handcuffs when he sneezes or sneezes.
The cabin crew must wear disposable medical gloves when handling a sick passenger or touching organic liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional personal protection equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or breathing difficulties.
Gloves and other disposable items must be disposed of in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.For commercial navigation, including cruise boats and other passenger boats, risk controls include postponing the trip in case of illness as well as self-isolation and immediate information to the boarding medical center if a fever or other symptoms develop once on board.
Ideally, medical monitoring should take place in the cabin of the isolated person.For school and childcare establishments, the CDC recommends short-term closure for purposes of cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has visited a school building, regardless of community spread.
In case of minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancellation of educational departures, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or dining in the canteen, increasing the space between offices, scaling the arrival and departure times, reducing non-essential visitors, and using a separate nursery for children with flu symptoms.
In case of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, an extension of school holidays may be considered.For law enforcement forces carrying out routine daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who need to come into contact with people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should follow the same guidelines as ambulances, including wearing adequate personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact during an arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belts before re-use using a towel or detergent spray and follow the standard procedures for confining and disposing of used EPIs as well as confining and washing clothes.
OSHA considers some healthcare and funeral workers to belong to high or very high risk exposure categories.
High-risk exposure jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become workers at very high risk of exposure if they perform aerosol-producing procedures or sampling or manipulation of patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures, or invasive sampling.
High-risk funeral jobs include workers involved in the preparation of bodies of people with suspected or known COVID-19 at the time of their death; they move to a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with suspected or known COVID-19, including when performing aerosol-producing procedures.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in certain sanitary and funeral environments.
The samples must be handled using Level 3 biosecurity precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating patients entering separate waiting rooms based on suspicion of COVID-19.In addition to other EPIs, OSHA recommends breathing masks for people working less than 6 feet from patients with suspected or known infection by SARS-CoV-2 and for those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95 respiratory filtration masks approved by NIOSH or higher must be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide superior protection and better comfort for the worker. The WHO does not recommend combinations because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic fluids.
The WHO recommends that surgical masks be worn only by the screening staff at the entry point.
For those who collect respiratory samples, care for or transport COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol-producing procedures, the WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or a facial screen, a blouse and gloves.
In case of aerosol-producing procedure, the surgical mask is replaced with a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
Since the global supply of EPI is insufficient, the WHO recommends limiting the need for EPI through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a room occupied by a COVID-19 patient to those directly involved in his care, using EPI needed for the specific task only, continuing the use of the same respiratory mask without removing it for the care of multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the EPI supply chain and deterring the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

This year we are in an exceptional situation.
The COVID-19 outbreak is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have to each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the type of empathy, cooperation and global community strengthening that is at the heart of this organization.
The camaraderie and kindness we’ve seen among all our colleagues in emails, calls and instant conversations is a remarkable testimony to the incredible human beings we’ve been lucky to work with.
I could not be more grateful and proud to have you all among my colleagues.
Last week, someone told me about their gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to view Wikipedia right now, and the strong symbol that this essential resource remains online and accessible to everyone.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you keep sites operational, pay our colleagues, or ensure the security of our communities.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but also how we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and the role you play in it, we will make significant adjustments to the way we work together starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and time jobs
As Robyn mentioned above, the team-c met last night to discuss our approach and how time will be used in the coming days and months.
During this conversation, we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to the situation we are facing and the best way to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
First of all, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to take a step back, don’t worry.
To all employees, contractors and subcontractors:
Our daily working time target will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until new order.
We do not declare holidays: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you can be helpful in the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, go shopping or see a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We do not monitor your hours.
If you are sick, don’t work.
It should go without saying, but we say it.
No sick leave or paid leave required: Just notify your boss and help your team review timetables and jobs to ensure that key work areas are covered.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19 positive, please notify Bryan of the T&C Ops department so that the T&C helps you and ensures that your situation receives the necessary attention from management.)
The staff will be fully paid.
We have already announced this, and reiterate our commitment to honour our responsibilities to our subcontractors and colleagues.
Everyone will be remunerated on the basis of their usual working hours performed under normal conditions.
This applies if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to evacuate their stress related to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like this.
Again, the goal is to preserve yourself.
We simply ask you to contact your superior, so that we know what to expect and can make the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are certain things that we must continue to do.
The SRE, Ops HR, Confidence & Security and Fundraising teams (among others) are performing critical work that may need reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments to evaluate current goals and focus on supporting the tasks that are fundamental to our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will simply focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now will not hurt later.
We don’t intend to “work twice as hard to recover lost time” when the pandemic passes.
We will not ask you to work extra hours to comply with now unrealistic deadlines.
We acknowledge that the circumstances have changed, and we will endeavour to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What is the App (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and daily working time targets, we plan to adjust the timetable for delivering our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that provides more time to set a budget to allow employees to focus on the essential work, take care of themselves and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or want to see their working hours shortened in the coming weeks.
This extension of deadlines significantly reduces the workload and current planning pressure across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and will inform delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as it is confirmed.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Location, Exhibition and Cleaning of the Office
Last week, we learned that one of our San Francisco-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of excessive caution, we called on an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own duty diligence protocol that uses products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork location, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all Washington DC-based staff.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a completely remote configuration in accordance with San Francisco’s advice.
As some of our New York-based colleagues know, we also discussed the idea of renting a room in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing but could be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who are accustomed to remote work are aware that adaptation can be difficult and would like to offer you some advice:
Reduce the length of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider dividing them over several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have an agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Make videos the standard, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and live exchange.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and speaker list, and someone to help take notes (or take collective notes).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your welfare refund for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about work distribution
The HR Operations team is studying ergonomic guidelines based on webinars to support the increased distribution of work within the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as edit-a-thons, until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understand that our cancellation requests and other restrictions could make it impossible for them to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalized if these goals were delayed or changed.
Next week we will publish additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sadness in the face of the upheaval and relief in the face of clarity and the ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and others.
Furthermore, the CRT is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communication with them.
Remaining in contact despite COVID-19 problems
We will send you an invitation on your calendar for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take advantage of this time to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way.
Until then, you can still find the information contained in this email, as well as all other essential information related to COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and gather all the information in one place.
We also strive to maintain regular communication with staff members residing in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, a major workflow or coverage difficulties, or if you need help with anything else, don’t hesitate to warn and work with the CRT.
We are there to support you and ensure the connection when necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive questions, please email Bryan Judan, Director of Global International HR Operations.
None of these changes should be considered as an abandonment of our work and obligations.
It is, on the contrary, to recognize that in the present moment, our work and obligations will probably have to adapt in an unprecedented way.
These are the steps we consider necessary to support each other and to continue our work, to provide our movement with the help it needs, and to offer the world the service that everyone can rely on.
Our planned work will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to help each other and prepare for the important work that will come in the weeks and maybe months to come.
We need each of you to this, which is why you must preserve yourself and take care of your families so that you can give the best of yourself when the time comes.
Finally, please wash your hands and do not touch your face.
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme linked to the outer side (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the angiotensin conversion enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7) making it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 is also the entry point into the cells of some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal enzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains a N-terminated peptidase M2 domain and a renal amino acid-transporting C-terminated collectrine domain.
ACE2 is a type I single-pass membrane protein whose enzymatically active field is exposed to the surface of the cells of the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is split from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is connected to the cell membrane mainly of the cells of type II pulmonary alveoli, small intestinal enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial cells of the smooth muscles of most organs.
ACE2’s mRNA expression is also present in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain trunk.
The main function of ACE2 is to compensate for ACE.
The ACE divides the angiotensin I hormone into vasoconstrictor angiotensin II.
ACE2 in turn divides the carboxyl terminating amino acid phenylamine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis into vasodilating angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also split several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinine, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembranary protein, ACE2 constitutes the main entry point into the cells of certain coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SRAS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, the binding of the spicle protein S1 of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic field of ACE2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and the translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into the endosomes inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the initiation of the S protein by the serine protease host TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as a potential treatment.This leads some to think that reducing ACE2 levels in cells can help fight infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that “the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control subjects.”
In addition, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had a higher risk of pneumonia, victims of stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less likely than for the overall risk of pneumonia.”
Human recombinant angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (rhACE2) is presumed to be an innovative treatment for severe lung lesions and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the time of action is 30 minutes in addition to the time of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 could be a promising drug for people with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (CAS) or for diseases with high angiotensin II circulation.
COVID-19 apps are mobile applications designed to facilitate the tracking of contacts in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the identification of people (“contracts”) likely to have come into contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in certain territories and jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracking applications.
These systems, in particular those based on tracking the geographical location of application users, raise privacy issues.
There are other less intrusive options, including using Bluetooth signals to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a feature that supports these Bluetooth apps.
The Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has deployed an app in China that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people carrying COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has, in turn, opted for an app called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local IT community, it has been provided as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched “StopKorona!”, a Bluetooth app that tracks exposure to potentially infected people and communicates quickly with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said that the contact tracking app was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed in the coming weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are considering setting up TraceTogether-based applications in Singapore and based on the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a georeference app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and residing in Moscow, to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, discussed several possible practical problems associated with the use of application-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of efficiency if only a small percentage of the population uses the app.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful “coronavirus” apps, Apple only authorizes “official” or generally trusted bodies to add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Privacy activists have expressed concerns about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass surveillance, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to cope with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat is removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
These organizations set out eight conditions to be met in the framework of government projects:
supervision should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
Extensions of control and surveillance should include extinction clauses.
the use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating COVID-19;
data security and anonymity should be protected in a demonstrable manner;
digital surveillance should ensure that any exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization is avoided;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be defined by law.
Protection against abuse and remedies for citizens in case of abuse should be provided.
The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) in Germany have also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from their device operating systems as soon as it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, which eliminates both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking has been approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems that rely on central servers need access to personal location data; several systems have been designed to use central servers solely for intercommunication, thus respecting privacy (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system has been used to track contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking and card transaction data, which they then combined to send SMS alerts to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government also made location information publicly available, which was allowed following profound changes to information privacy laws following the MERS outbreak that hit the country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized systems that preserve privacy.
Details have not yet been disclosed on April 6, 2020.
Privacy-respecting contact tracking is a well-established concept, backed by a large volume of research data as of 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-respecting solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and does not constitute a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that personally identifiable data never leaves the device and that all matching is carried out on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group is currently developing SafePaths, a platform that uses privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or contact data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the white paper “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” published in March 2020. Enigma MPC’s SafeTrace platform, a privacy technology development company originally founded at MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to enable users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising their privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols, in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, a key factor in their adoption by the general public.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced the release of the source code for the BlueTrace protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, stating that it would preserve privacy and combine Bluetooth Low Energy technology with privacy-enhancing encryption.
They also published the specifications of the core technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is expected to be deployed in three phases:
Deployment of tools to enable governments to create privacy-respecting official coronavirus tracking applications
Direct integration of this feature in iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to solve problems of adoption of the solution and persistence of monitoring by initially deploying the system through OS updates and subsequently removing it in the same way once the threat is removed.
Repositioning a medicinal product (also referred to as reorientation, reprofiling, reallocation or change of therapeutic indication of a medicinal product) means the conversion of a medicinal product approved for a disease or medical condition different from the one for which it was originally developed.
It is a scientific research axis currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research areas include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and plasma transfusion from convalescent individuals. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 therapeutic target proteins, each with multiple ligand-binding sites.
The analysis of these link sites offers the realistic project of developing an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-type protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, heliase, S protein, and ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical trial to recommend in the design of a clinical trial.
Chlorokin is an anti-malaria drug also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chlorokin and related hydroxychloroquin would be among the four drugs studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA’s clinical trial process and is only authorized under the U.S.A. as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized but unable to receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that “the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection” has not yet been established.
The doctors suggested using this medicine “when there is no other option.”
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorokin in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
More extensive studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School conducts a trial on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials conducted in Wuhan and Shenzhen stated that favipiravir was “clearly effective.”
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative over an average period of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in the 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a Wuhan study of 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir and the other half received umifenovir.

According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up possibilities for the Trump administration to acquire the drug.The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to procreate.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that “no benefit was observed”.
These drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that would bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against several filovirus, pneumovirus, paramyxovirus and coronavirus.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that remedivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, two of which are conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one involving people with moderate disease and the other with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials on intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China and Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).

A multicenter study involving 300 patients and studying the use of enoxaparine sodium in preventive and therapeutic dosages was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on repositioning approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous outbreaks such as the MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin Recommended for Treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th Edition of Chinese Guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir Recommended for the Treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th Edition of Chinese Guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as COVID-19 treatments:
Tocilizumab (anti-receptor IL-6): approved by China.
Trials are also underway in Italy and China. see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical coronavirus vaccine 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical trials, many development attempts are underway.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, the disease-causing virus, before at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were undergoing Phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak has been declared around the world in 2020, generating significant investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using the published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Defined in April, the CEPI’s vaccine development initiative’s requirements are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists that 10 different technology platforms were conducting research and development projects in early 2020 with the aim of creating an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform targets of Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenoviral vector type 5)
As CEPI scientists said in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, including 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) confirmed as active and 37 other announced, but with little public information available (presumed in planning or design).
A Phase I-II trial conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, placebo-controlled and carried out in several centers all, determining more accurate effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in disease prevention, while monitoring adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active-development vaccine candidates (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human evaluation phase (still in “preclinical” research).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular pince vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.

development and manufacture of vaccines.
The partners also announced preclinical trial projects and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even in an accelerated procedure, it would take about a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company from Quebec, Quebec, said it was developing a coronavirus-like particle through partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is undergoing laboratory research, with tests on humans scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “huge sums of money to benefit from exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine,” which sparked protest from the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of a vaccine based on mRNA.
The BNT162 mRNA-based vaccine candidate is currently in the preclinical trial phase with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the human testing of its final vaccine candidate could begin in autumn.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced a $4.9 million investment in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, raising CEPI’s total investment in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine to $29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun testing on animals of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of sending the sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced $275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of $192 million C dedicated to the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 with plans to create a national “vaccine bank” containing several new vaccines that could be used if further coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine testing PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, stating that “SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunits of vaccines administered by micro-nails triggered a significant antigen-specific antibody response [at mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization.”
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the potential form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the immune system.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities joined forces to access IBM supercomputers, coupled with cloud-hosted IT resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia is scheduled to include 4,170 health professionals.
It is possible that vaccines in development are not safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the effectiveness of a vaccine using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates a need for implementation of Level 3 biosecurity confinement measures for handling live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
By 2020, there will be no curative or protective vaccine against SARS that has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SARS were a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.
When MERS spread, it was thought that existing SRAS research could serve as a model for developing vaccines and medicines for MERS-CoV infection.
By March 2020, only one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three were underway; all vaccines were viral vector, two adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Posts on social media have spread a conspiracy theory that the virus that caused COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents on genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as the SRAS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
While the majority of cases cause mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured. The virus spreads mainly through close contact, often through droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or speaking.
Since these droplets are produced upon expiration, they usually fall to the ground or on surfaces rather than pose an infectious risk over long distances.
People can also get infected by touching an infected surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious within the first three days after symptoms appear, although contagion is possible before symptoms appear and during the later phases of the disease.The standard test method uses reverse transcription of real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Recommendations regarding the use of masks by the general public vary, with some authorities not recommending their use, others recommending their use, and others still imposing their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus can be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and a blue face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor immediately.
Less often, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nasal leakage or sore throat can be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying proportions.
Some cases in China initially showed only chest pressure and palpitations.
In some, the disease can cause pneumonia, failure of several organs and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can go up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, however preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The Korean Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (KCDC) that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1st; out of 166 infections found today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Both sputum and saliva can carry significant viral loads.
Speaking loudly releases more drops than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without protecting can project droplets to a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally carried by air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors placed in the corridor outside the patient chambers produced viral RNA positive samples.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can disperse respiratory secretions and thus result in aerial spread.
Although there are concerns about fecal spread, this risk is perceived as low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although spread may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three others.
The virus was detected after a day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and after four hours on 99 percent copper.
This varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used correctly; soap-based products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, disabling it and removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective.In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second test day.
Coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia linked to the foci of Wuhan acute respiratory disease.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by home soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the host cells through the angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is the most abundant in type II alveolar cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called a “spicule” (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and penetrate into the host cell.
Acute heart damage has been in 12% of people admitted to the Wuhan hospital in China, and is more common when the disease is more severe.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to the systemic inflammatory response and disorders of the immune system during the progression of the disease, however, acute myocardial lesions may also be linked to ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and in the cardiac functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) has been observed in intensive care units with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract that express ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, GM-CSF-secreting T cells have been associated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL6 and severe pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytal infiltrates were also at the autopsy.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngeal sampling; however, a nasal or sputum sampling can also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours or even up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, however they require two blood samples taken at a two-week interval and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and released the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop PCR tests to detect infection with the virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which could detect active infections and a person’s previous infection) were being developed, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese experiment of the test revealed an accuracy of only 60 to 70%.
The U.S. FDA approved the first patient-nearest test on March 21, 2020 to be used by the end of this month.Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral, multi-lobular glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the beginning of infection.
Dominance under pleural, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings of the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of severe viral pneumonia can be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, extended atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of giant multinucleated cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxemia.
healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in the alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (CIVD) and leuko-erythroblastic reactions
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a towel when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow in the absence of a towel.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommended covering the face with a cloth in public places to limit the transmission in the case of asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim at reducing the contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing displacement and cancelling major groupings of people.
Distance guidelines also include the observance of a minimum distance of 6 feet (1,8 m) between people.
Since a vaccine is not expected before 2021 at the earliest, a key element of managing COVID-19 is trying to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also known as “flattering the curve.”
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after wet, coughing, or sneezing.
It also recommends using a hand disinfectant that contains at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available.For areas where commercial hand disinfectants are not available, the WHO offers two formulas for local production.
In these formulas, the antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial spores in alcohol, it is “not an antiseptic active substance for hands”.
Glycerin is added as a humectant.
Individuals are treated through supportive care which may include water treatment, oxygen therapy, and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of being carriers of the virus wear a simple facial mask.
Extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being analyzed.
Personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and a healthy diet have been recommended to promote immunity.
Supporting treatments can be useful in those who have moderate symptoms in the early stages of infection. The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the care of people hospitalized for COVID-19.
Reanimation physicians and pneumologists in the United States have compiled therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
As for symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen in the front line.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in care conditions where the performance of the procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For healthcare professionals who care for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an airborne isolation chamber (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne transmission precautions.
Recommended equipment is: PPE blush, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves.
N95 respiratory masks are approved in industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an Emergency Use Authorization (US).
They are designed to protect air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protective screens, or as a last resort, handmade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory assistance for people suffering from respiratory failure related to COVID-19 is being actively studied for hospitalized people. Some evidence indicates that intubation can be avoided by using a high-speed nasal canule or a positive double-level respiratory pressure.
It is unclear whether either or both of them generate the same benefits for people in a critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to stick to invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to a high-speed nasal canal.
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, limiting the healthcare system’s ability to deal with a sudden peak in COVID-19 cases that are severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30 percent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices that offer pressure control modes and high PEEP are needed to optimize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of lung damage associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatments has begun in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are undergoing clinical trials.
The recovery seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed before 2021, several testing drugs are already approved for other indications and tests are already advanced.
Antiviral medication can be tried in people suffering from a severe disease.
The WHO has recommended that volunteers participate in trials on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments.The FDA has granted temporary permission to the plasma of convalescent individuals as experimental treatment in cases where the person’s life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not undergone the necessary clinical trials to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID.
The application is able to detect “near contacts” using surveillance data and thus detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, it also alerts local health authorities.Massive data analysis from mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and people with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to locate mobile phone data of people suspected of having the coronavirus.
The measure was aimed at enforcing quarantine and protecting people who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to analyze and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not comply with quarantine.
In Italy, regional health minister Giulio Gallera said he was informed by mobile operators that “40% of people continue to move.”
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has launched a global call to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
People can suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have a moderate course with little or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as colds.
Moderate cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection according to data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is lacking.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to develop into an acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multivisceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation disorders, and heart, kidney, and liver damage.
Coagulation disorders, an increase in prothrombin time, were in 6% of cases hospitalized with COVID-19, with renal failure observed in 4% of people in this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people with COVID-19 have high levels of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the average duration between the onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range between six and 41 days.
In a study by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men had a 2.8% mortality rate, while women had a 1.7% mortality rate.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem pulmonary samples show diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lungs resembles an acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8% of deaths by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart damage due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest was observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of people hospitalized had pre-existing diseases.The availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region can also impact mortality.
Estimates of the disease mortality rate vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Undercounting moderate cases can lead to overvaluation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms and were 2.4 times more likely to go to intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
The Hong Kong hospital administration observed a 20% to 30% decrease in respiratory capacity in some people recovered from the disease, and lung scanners suggest organ damage.
This can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome after healing.
By March 2020, it was unknown whether a previous infection provided effective long-term immunity in people cured from the disease.
Immunity is considered likely, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases of people cured from COVID-19 followed by positive coronavirus tests at a later date have been.
These cases are seen as an exacerbation of a latent infection rather than a reinfection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and of animal origin, by spreading the infection.
The real origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost exclusively carried out by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet found that the earliest date of symptom onset dates back to December 1, 2019.
WHO official publications the first appearance of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measurements are usually used to assess mortality.
These numbers vary by region and time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the healthcare system, therapeutic options, the time since the outbreak began, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, gender and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the CIM-10 emergency pathological codes U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from COVID-19 cases diagnosed from a clinical or epidemiological point of view without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to statistics from Johns-Hopkins University, the global death/case ratio is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR) which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from the disease and the infectious mortality rate (IRF) which reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed or not) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d’Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1,7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease has spread through festivals, and to young people, generating a relatively low mortality rate, and all COVID-19-related deaths may not have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people may have antibodies, according to a blood donor assessment.
69 deaths (0,004% of the population) were confirmed to be related to COVID-19.
The impact of pandemics and mortality rates are different in men and women.
Mortality is higher in humans in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The risk is highest in 50-year-old men, with the difference between men and women disappearing only at age 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioral factors could be part of it.
Immunological gender differences, the lower prevalence of smoking in women and the development in men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a less advanced age than in women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of people who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government will not collect gender-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, flu and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of healthcare workers, especially nursing staff, are women and are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be “COVID-19”.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), an animal species or a group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations aimed at preventing stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 virus” in its public communication.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as “coronavirus.”
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often referred to as “coronavirus” and “Wuhan coronavirus”.
In January 2020, the WHO recommended the use of the provisional disease names 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCoV for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 directive against the use of places in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Given the capacity limits of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as shells and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respirator valve and the supplier could not supply it on time, a local startup redesigned and printed the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that humans are able to spread the disease to other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicines or vaccines are approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 is currently conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the “SOLIDARITY trial” to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising effectiveness.
There are no vaccines available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE 2 receptor to penetrate human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being studied.
First, researchers are trying to create an entire virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to provoke a rapid immune response from the human body in the event of a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit-based vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on spicle S protein that helps the virus infiltrate the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA vaccination, a new technique for creating vaccinations).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied onto the virus that causes the disease. The dependent activation of the antibody has been suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven studies evaluated previously approved malaria treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Converted antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, with nine Phase III clinical trials on remdesivir in several countries expected to be by the end of April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of COVID-19 vaccine candidates and drugs was also in place in April 2020.A number of existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chlorochine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with beta interferon.
Preliminary data suggest the effectiveness of remedesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with remedesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy. Chlorokin, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some require an independent analysis of research work.
Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chlorokin.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that doubling that dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorization at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for a further in vivo study after demonstrating low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spicle protein starting using serine 2 transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry through interaction with ACE 2 receptor.
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine studies with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine shock can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence indicating that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine anti-shock properties. Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
It is undergoing a non-randomized Phase 2 test nationally in Italy after showing positive results in people with a severe form of the disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine shock, it should counteract such developments that are suspected to cause the death of some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-induced refractory cytokine relief syndrome, CAR T cells treatment, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence indicating that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for SCR.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by the immune systems of people who have been cured from COVID-19 to people who need it is being studied as a non-vaccinated method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SRAS with few conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action by which passive antibody treatment can generate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
Convalescent serum production, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of healed patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
