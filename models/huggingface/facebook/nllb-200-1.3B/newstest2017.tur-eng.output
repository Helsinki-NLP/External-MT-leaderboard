28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco shopping mall
The 28-year-old cook, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead this week in the stairwell of a local shopping mall.
However, the victim's brother said that he did not think that someone might want to hurt him, saying: "In the end, things were going well for him".
The San Francisco Coroner's Office said the body found Wednesday morning at the Westfield Mall belonged to 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco Police Department said the cause of death was determined to be homicide and that the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a chef in Boston, had taken his dream job six months ago as a chef at San Francisco Sons & Daughters.
A Sons & Daughters official said the death "has left them in shock and deeply saddened".
"We have a small team here that works like a tight family and he will be greatly missed", the spokesperson explained.
We want to let Frank's family know that they are not alone in this difficult time and that our prayers are with them.
Louis Galicia noted that Frank initially stayed in hostels and said, "Eventually things were going well for him".
Louis Galicia told KGO, "He was renting an apartment and dating a girl".
Louis Galicia said he didn't think he was someone who might want to hurt his little brother.
He was a kind man with a big heart.
The way to connect with the family was always to prepare a plate for us, to cook for us", said Louis Galicia.
He didn't like to get into arguments.
My brother was a man of many talents.
"He was this unfinished diamond that shone brightly every day when everything else in the world went wrong", she said.

Assistant doctors in strike: new calls to slow down work
Representatives of the assistant doctors asked their unions to allow them to slow down work in connection with a dispute over a new contract.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Assistant Doctors' Committee (JDC) has called on the general council to support further work slowdown action from early September.
JDC expressed that the ministers were unable to address concerns about the contract.
The assistant doctors and medical students voted no in the contract agreement with the BMA.
This was rejected by 58% of the voting members.
In a post on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC president Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "firmly silent" about the issues that led to the contract's rejection.
He said: "In light of this, the JDC Board voted to reject the proposed new contract altogether and called for the resumption of formal negotiations on the concerns".
In response to the government's silence, the JDC administration has issued a formal request to the BMA Board to allow a program to increase the work slowdown from early September.
The dispute led to six strikes by assistant doctors this year, including the first total cuts in the history of the NHS.
Dr. Johann Malawana, the assistant doctor leader at the BMA, resigned after the BMA's proposed terms of the contract were voted down.
During the pre-voting meetings of 54,000 physician assistants and medical students, he told BMA members that this was a good deal that needed to be accepted.
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be implemented in a way that would apply to doctors in the UK.
Russia and Turkey: A 'coalition of the disagreeable'?
It was a gesture to end the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the official end of an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish counterpart in the stately hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I had the distinct impression that the party most keen on this compromise was Ankara.
Shake hands, yeah.
But Mr. Putin's smile was rather faint and could not be said to have exuded any warmth, even against his own narrow standards.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly referred to his "good friend" Mr. Putin, five times, according to one report.
I'm surprised by the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to the pre-crisis level, but would reach much higher levels.
The next day, a local newspaper reported that Mr. Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had happened.
I think his excitement was the opposite.
But Mr. Putin's cold-blooded criticism has shown that the Russian leader has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shooting down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Russia's response at the time was full of rage.
Mr. Putin, in a tough statement, accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The resentment was much greater, the other side was supposed to be friendly.
It will be difficult, if not impossible, to truly rebuild trust.
Since November, the opinion of the Russian people has also changed.
The state-controlled media has been targeting Ankara in a shocking and aggressive manner for months.
Suddenly, the Turks are to blame for everything.
The most serious of these were the accusations by senior officials that Mr. Erdogan's family profited from the illegal oil trade in areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
He flatly denied it.
But the official message from St. Petersburg was that it was time to move on.
In the end, the reason this meeting took place was because Mr. Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia might see this as some sort of victory.
The benefits of calling for a ceasefire for Ankara are clear.
First, Erdogan needs friends after the failed coup last month that almost toppled him.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey also affected him greatly.
And economic reasons are also active.
Russia's sanctions have been severe, especially the ban on private flights carrying several million Russian tourists to Turkey's coastal regions every year.
That number has dropped by almost 90 percent.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies are also relieved that flights will continue.
They're relying on the seasonal intensity of the Mediterranean.
And this week, state television predicted that with the re-importation of Turkish agricultural products, the prices of fruits and vegetables will fall.
To quote a story in the Vedemosti newspaper, "Tourists there, tomatoes here".
But the visit had a separate political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for not finding the response to the coup inadequate.
Added to his long-standing anger at the swift progress of the talks on joining the US, Mr. Putin is now trying to take advantage of Turkey's breakdown of ties with the West and the coldness between them.
The Russian leader certainly seems to have gained sympathy from Ankara for his call to support elected officials after the coup attempt.
It should be remembered that this was an unavoidable attitude for Moscow, which itself had a deep-seated fear of regime change.
This summit, held in this stately palace by the sea, represents what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of the discordant", Russia and Turkey: joining forces that the West has rejected and abused.
And yet, despite this appearance of harmony, they are quite different.
One of the most important is about Syria: Moscow presents itself as a mediator, but Russia and Turkey support different sides.
This is supported by the fact that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents said that the issue was not discussed at the press conference.
While the President of Turkey avoided answering a question about these differences, Mr. Putin chose to underline them.
There is no clear consensus on how to define common ground in Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the absolute catastrophic potential of NATO member Turkey shooting down a Russian warplane - it is certainly a good development that the two leaders have at least begun to talk.
Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing for customers outside Scotland
According to the statement of the bank's executive board, the RBS brand will move to the back office position.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will cease to exist for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand is linked to the bank's global goals.
Eight years ago, he was almost bankrupt, so he had to back out and give it up.
During this time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
This was backed by millions of pounds for many sponsorships, from the Six Nations rugby championships to the Andy Murray Wimbledon championship.
But now, it was decided that it would be right to put more national brands first.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers but no new start-ups will be made.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, except in the case of central and stock exchange listings, shall be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are also smaller brands that will take on a much more dominant role for individual banking; Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan was interviewing clients and staff on a tour of Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "As we will be a bank of more brands from now on, the RBS brand will no longer be our investor brand and the brand where our staff are employed".
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying we no longer have global goals, but local ones.
Each of these brands will stand out in a slightly different way in the community in which they are located, and our staff will work with customers under the brand names.
RBS announced that it would not continue sponsoring the Six Nations Championship and that it was raising the profile of different brands in terms of sports sponsorship.
The CEO said, "It's time to get into the brand banking concept because how do we make it a better bank for customers?"
Three years ago, if we had said we were going to be a great bank for our customers and offer these brands, I would have thought that was ridiculous.
But I think with the work we're doing and focusing on the needs of the customers, not ourselves, you're going to see a lot of change.
We can put these brands back into action, so I think this is the right time.
Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th with Predilection at Newmarket.
Dettori has exploded champagne after his 3,000th win with a double at Newmarket.
Jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
At the local track, he reached this milestone with his second victory of the night in Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in the unimpeded run.
He is following in the footsteps of Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
"This is a special situation", said the jockey, who had previously won three championships in Ghayyar.
I'm so moved that my family's here.
I'm really happy that this is Newmarket, where I started this business 30 years ago.
This is not a big meeting, not a Royal Ascot - just an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and relieved.
Dettori accepted the cheers by bringing Predilection to the victory.
Two jockeys have reached this milestone in the handicap race: champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired jockey Sir Anthony McCoy, who won the championship 20 times and over 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, who has won the Derby nine times, has 4,493 career wins.
Frankie is one of the greatest jockeys of our time, and it's no wonder he's reached a milestone that few have before him.
He's a man of style and strength, but his tactical mindset has the element of weighing him down on the scales.
He's an extraordinary representative of the sport of horse racing, and his passion and charisma have attracted people to the sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie at Epsom that if he wasn't a jockey who races only on weekends and big races, he could have gotten his 6,000th win.
Seriously, Frankie has spent most of his 30 years racing in the UK winning, which is great to see.
He's got a very exciting character, which is a very good quality for British racing, but he's also an outstanding jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this milestone with a symbolic jumping from a horse.
From his jump-finishes to his jump-offs to his landings, Frankie Dettori has become an icon of British open-wheel racing for over twenty years.
It was a bumpy road.
In 1996, he survived a plane crash and was banned for failing to comply with a drug ban, despite winning several major races, including the famous 'Big Seven' victory at Ascot.
Although he struggled at first during his return from that six-month suspension three years ago, he has shown the strength of character needed to expose those who suspect him and return to his best.
And it could go on for a while; Dettori had previously expressed a desire to continue racing until at least 50.
Russian President Putin dismissed his private colleague Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his private detective Sergei Ivanov.
Mr. Ivanov was part of Mr. Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
63 years old, now appointed as Special Representative for Environment and Transportation issues.
A statement from the Kremlin said Mr. Putin had "decided to terminate Ivanov's position as head of the Russian administration", but gave no reason.
Anton Vaino, who has been acting as deputy since 2012, was appointed to this position.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, she graduated from the Department of International Relations of the renowned Moscow State Institute (MGIMO) and served in the Embassy of Tokyo.
Later he was involved in the presidential protocol and administration of government personnel; the statements on the Kremlin website are as follows (in Russian).
After his commissioning, he told Mr. Putin, "Thank you for your trust in me".
I believe the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in the formulation of laws and the supervision of the execution of orders.
Mr. Putin told Russian TV on Friday that he had asked Mr. Ivanov to step down and suggested Mr. Vaino to take his place.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a move that has astonished Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies, and like himself, served in the Soviet security forces, the KGB.
He was one of the most powerful men in the country, in his own right.
In a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on state television, both said the private pen was removed at his own request.
But despite the smiling poses on the cameras, few here are convinced, especially as parliamentary elections approach.
And is this some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
But the official statement that a potential president suddenly wanted to direct Russia's environmental policy was met with great suspicion.
According to the Kremlin's website, Mr. Ivanov addressed Mr. Putin with the following words: "It is true that in a speech we had earlier in 2012, I asked you to trust me for four years for this difficult - even problematic - task.
Well, apparently I served as the president's private pen for four years and eight months.
Mr. Ivanov took over the job in December 2011.
He previously served as deputy prime minister and defense minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security forces, like Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Mr. Putin was the head of the Federal Security Forces (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr. Ivanov appointed him as his deputy.
When Mr. Putin came to power, he listed Ivanov as one of his five most trusted men.
It was thought that Mr. Ivanov could become president after Mr. Putin's second term, because it was unconstitutional for Mr. Putin to be president for a third term.
But that task was given to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr. Putin became prime minister three and a half years later before returning to the presidency.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after shooting a producer
Gibson got into a physical fight on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produced the series, announced in a joint statement that he was fired.
Gibson, who plays Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology Tuesday before the cancellation announcement.
There were differences and a disagreement about creative themes on the set.
"I am saddened that such an incident has occurred", he said in a statement.
A statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios said details on how Gibson's character would be removed from the show, which follows a group of FBI agents, will be released at a later date.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously appeared in the situation comedy Dharma & Greg, had been with the show since its first season in 2005.
Gibson said in a statement released Friday, "I love Criminal Minds and have worked with it my whole heart and soul for the past twelve years".
I'd like to stay till the end, but that's no longer possible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our amazing crew, and most importantly, the best backers a show can have.
The show is expected to return to the screens on September 28 for its twelfth season.
The mystery of the fish in Banff's garden
A resident of Banff County requested help identifying fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that these 75 fish could be sand fish carried by a seawall.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, posted the images on Periscope in the hope that someone might shed light on the emergence of two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Bridge: now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern and the viaduct of the Queensferry Bridge, which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four closures between the "billboard fans" that are about to be completed around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The section of the bridge from Fife is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 support cables.
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Treasury Secretary Keith Brown was one of the first to walk from the land bridge to the facility today.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Gate.
We are all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale with this project that used over 30,000 tons of concrete to build this part of the bridge alone.
Despite the extraordinary size and weight of the bridge that closes the gap between the viaduct and the bridge sign, this is a delicate study that requires extremely delicate tolerances for compatibility.
Overall, almost 79% of the total bridge signage has been installed, with the first concrete casting of the signage to take place today in Rosyth, which means the entire signage will be ready to be removed from the bridge.
Michael Martin, project director at Forth Gate and Bridge Contractors, said: "In all bridge projects, the first closure is always an important milestone.
In this extraordinary project, this closure represents a pioneering moment in civil engineering.
After the final road sign was installed and connected to the expanding North Tower level, we had to close the gap on the northern - or land - side.
This was accomplished by the northern pole being pulled southward by 700 millimeters.
It was a huge, but also a very delicate operation.
The reason it was so big was that the track was 222 meters long, weighed almost 6,000 tons, and had to be pulled at about a 3% slope.
The reason it was so sensitive was that the tolerance values the team had to meet were so low, only a few millimeters on either side.
Thank God it all worked out.
Moelfre Bay rescue team: Three men 'lucky to be alive'
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after falling from a fishing boat in Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station issued an alarm at 13:20 on Friday, British summer time, after the system spotted the incident in Moelfre Bay.
Three men were struggling to swim to safety as their boats continued on their own.
"We saw the boat circling towards them and were worried", said the controller of the Moelfre lifeboat.
He added, "Unfortunately, it was a violent wind that took it away from them until we made a clear path for them".
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat while the third man, aged 60, was found clinging to a shaman without a life vest, exhausted.
They were all taken to the lifeboat that was heading for the shore and brought to the lifeboat station
Mr. Jones said: "Three men who fell into the water were lucky to be alive and not to have been injured.
There was an emergency stop cable in the boat's engine, but it must have been disconnected from the boat's operator somehow when the boat was in the hold.
These three men were being watched today.
A valuable form of hunting for health and happiness, Pokémon Go
It's really amazing to see how the world has changed.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play games, preferring to spend their free time staring at screens, was a sad state of affairs for many people over the past decade.
Pokemon Go encourages people to get up and move around.
The time spent looking at screens was initially limited to television, but over time it spread to video games and eventually to smartphones.
So it's really great to see that technology and outdoor movement are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, I'm talking about Pokémon Go, a character-based application originally created for video games in the '90s (and later evolved into cartoons, playing cards, and other byproducts).
Like many popular culture phenomena, this new game was met with a mixed reaction when it was launched in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Later, the release was delayed in other countries due to the intense interest caused by server overload.
Within days, Pokémon Go had reached more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In short, players take their smartphones, search for Pokémon in a GPS-tracked manner, and can 'photograph' (take a screenshot on the phone) or 'capture' what they find.
He joined the craze by getting off the couch in search of a generation that had played the game at a younger age.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by an "average" person each day.
Cardiogram, an app developed for the Apple Watch and tracking 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the percentage of people it tracked who exercised 30 days a day rose from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go; they can only see raw data at the practice level.
Most public health campaigns that encourage people to "take 30 minutes", "get off the couch", and "be active every day" have been ignored because most public health messages are boring and conveyed by seemingly miserable individuals.
But the importance of exercise is not emphasized.
People who exercise regularly have a lower risk of cancer or depression.
Exercise helps with weight control, high blood pressure, and diabetes, and it has a long list of benefits that cannot be listed here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it takes people out to do something they enjoy.
This is the way to meet all three of the basic elements of health: exercise, fresh air, and recreation with sunlight.
Some people even make new friends during the hunt.
As always, there are the unsympathetic playboy looking for something to complain about.
And of course, someone might knock on the door while walking.
What's the difference?
A major innovation has been introduced.
Smartphone apps like Fitbit track our movements, but they don't give us a reason to exercise like this game.
The impact of innovation will pass and the use will diminish over time.
However, due to the success of Pokémon, there will be many games that help people who hunt become more active, fit and healthy through apps and the combination of virtual reality with real-world activities.

Simone Biles won the gold medal in the women's gymnastics all-around.
Forget about the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic about the jump.
It's comfortable on the balance.
It's amazing with the ground.
From top to bottom, perfection.
And he's an Olympic champion now.
The 19-year-old American gymnast, who finished first overall on Thursday, made a clear distinction between herself and the rest of the world at the Olympics.
His total score of 62,198 was well above that of silver medalist and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States performed on the balance beam in the women's artistic gymnastics all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth consecutive and fifth overall American woman to receive the overall rating award, and she established her reputation as one of the best of her generation and perhaps of all time.
When the final volume was published, he was in tears, and his long journey to that moment was over.
This achievement put him on par with athletes like Michael Phelps, who only once in every generation took the sport to new heights:
Biles spent the last three years as one of the sport's most successful athletes, with a blend of ambition and precision with striking routines that led to 15 world championship medals, 10 of them gold, and the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton calling her "the best gymnast I have ever seen".
A final test was waiting for him in Brazil, a contest between Biles and the burden of high expectations rather than being among the others on the field.
He would have been disappointed to return to his family home in Spring, Texas with less than a handful of gold medals.
Simone Biles, left, of the United States, and Aly Raisman, after winning gold and silver medals, respectively, in the women's all-around at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, Aug.
Biles won his first on Tuesday, when he served as a celebrity gesture at retired national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's farewell party.
While Biles insists on never looking ahead in this long run to the top, that's not exactly true.
The section, which includes the iconic imitation of the floor exercise routine, is set to Latin music to fit perfectly into the street just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
This is no coincidence.
Adopted by her grandparents when she was a younger child and discovered by Boorman's mother on a trip to a gym where she was coached by Aimee Boorman, she became a force.
He hasn't lost a general election since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that Biles should continue as long as he wants.
Mustafina took the lead in two rounds, but it was temporary.
The balance and floor exercises that Biles had taken on as world champion had not yet been done.
He led the way with 15,433 points on the balance beam and capped it off with 15,933 points on the floor exercise.
Raisman politely hugged her lightly as she waited for the final score, and as Biles' vision, once written in a scribbling notebook, became a reality, tears appeared around the glittering red, white and blue eye makeup.
Raisman's performance was a rematch of four years earlier, when he shared fourth but then lost the bronze medal to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, whom the Americans call "Nine", led the way.
He's overcome with a seemingly suspicious comeback from time to time, where he sends a kiss to the crowd after the drill.
For 19-year-old Biles, the tweet he shared earlier this week has taken on a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot in serial murder case, while listening to music in car
In Phoenix's first serial killer case in a decade, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot while talking in a car and listening to music, according to police reports released Thursday.
Authorities say Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on a garage road on June 12.
The report states that the gunman fired eight shots with a pistol while standing on the passenger side of the car and fled in another vehicle.
Police say these three murders don't appear to be robbery-related because the assailant didn't take the adult victims' handbags or $2,900 in cash.
Phoenix police spokesman Lieutenant Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to investigate whether it was connected to the four previous attacks.
In a four-month period, seven people were killed and two were injured in nine attacks in predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods.
Howard told CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month, "This was in a residential area in front of a house".
The suspect is believed to have driven a brown Nissan in a late 1990s model, a black BMW in a late 1990s model, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln, among several other vehicles.
Investigators declined to disclose evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked to the same killer and carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to hospital with his injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for the men to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on a shooting that targeted an empty truck half an hour before the three murders.
Investigators found shell casings, pulled one from a seat, and found bullet particles in the engine compartment.
The mother of a 6-year-old microcephaly patient: "He's getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves to sing, to play with toys, and of course, his mother.
But unlike his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto was unaware of during her pregnancy.
When you first came home, my first thought was, I can't do this.
I can't do that. I can't do that.
I didn't want that.
Of course, that's not true, of course you want to".
He and his husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and might not even survive.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that he be placed in a nursing home.
Picciuto explained, "My first reaction was to say that I didn't think people were doing it anymore".
Edmund can walk with a walker.
Edmund couldn't sit up or sit down until he was three, and he still can't talk.
But he's slowly reaching some turning points.
He can walk and ride a bicycle with help.
She also likes to play games and sing with her two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund invented to say "please sing to me".
Picciuto told CBS News, "We are teaching him sign language".
But it's not sign language as we know it, it says Edmund made up his own signals.
Microsephaly can occur due to a number of different conditions, including a genetic condition such as Edmund's, and infections during pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles and Zika.
The symptoms and course of the disease can vary greatly.
It's too early to say how the lives of people with Zika infection will be affected by this.
Picciuto recalls the emotional burden of the uncertainty of his future.
I kept asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't know it.
In fact, I haven't asked a question about the course of the disease in a long time because I didn't expect anyone to actually tell me.
But Picciuto is able to offer hopeful advice to mothers of babies born with Zika birth defects.
He's getting better and better.
You know it's better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and flooding in Louisiana, Mississippi, prompted rescue teams to move
Heavy rains and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected by Saturday.
The National Weather Service reported flooding in numerous rivers in northeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi, posing a widespread flood hazard following heavy rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials were in constant contact with local authorities and that support was on the way to affected neighborhoods.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said there were requests for high-water vehicles, boats and bulwarks.
Steele said there's tons of demand for the Tangipahoa neighborhood alone.
A flood watch will be in place for most of southern Louisiana by Saturday.
The weather service said in a statement that there could be an additional 3 to 5 inches of rainfall in the area.
In southern Alabama, a flash flood warning was in effect Saturday as rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
Both are expected to reach record levels during the week in the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs in Louisiana.
Forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also stated that the flood flow in the Ascension neighborhood poses a threat because the flooded rivers will flow slowly into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, was already at its highest level measured at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue teams continue to rescue people from flooding in the Amite and Wilkinson waterfalls in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, said the water from the Beaver River, which is normally 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly during the night.
Another stepson who lived nearby said he was warned.
Hansford said, "We woke up and the water kept coming".
It was as far as I could get.
His wife told Hansford that this was the highest level she'd seen in the creek in the 48 years she'd lived here.
Hansford stated that he and his family were disabled and that he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three in a large, military-style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloucester where they were sheltering on Friday.
Krautmann said flooding was "spreading rapidly" as heavy rains continued and authorities were considering issuing evacuation orders.
Krautmann said an observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight until Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground has been highly saturated since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and flooding of streets have prompted the need to rescue residents of the Tangipahoa neighborhood and to vacate schools in five school districts.
WWL, a CBS affiliate, reported that a woman city councilwoman in Tangipahoa said 200 homes were flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but they are also underwater.
Neighborhood Commissioner Robby Miller said authorities have rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped by rising waters.
Shelters for evacuees have been opened in Amite and Hammond.
He said, "When the waters begin to recede, they will be allowed to return home".
In Hammond, Tangipahoa Parish, nearly two dozen streets were closed due to rising waters, and picket lines were provided for residents to take in to keep water out of their homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we experienced was in March", said city administrator Lacy Landrum.
This looks like it's going to be a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said rain has continued steadily along the Gulf Coast.
He said that on Tuesday several houses were reported to be flooded, but as of Friday there has been no notification in this regard.
Keith Townson, the manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I saw water where I'd never seen water before", said Townson, adding, "and it's still raining".
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown, whose body was punctured by bullets, survived the Philadelphia attack.
Police say a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
Mahaj Brown was identified by his grandparents for CBS Philadelphia.
His grandparents said Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the body, including the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when he was taken to hospital.
Her grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station, "She suffered a lot, her tiny body was punctured by bullets".
I can't believe this.
The boy was listed in critical care at the hospital and underwent some surgeries.
The family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He was going to start his first year at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown area.
Two men, 29, 32, were shot.
CBS Philadelphia said one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, while the other two victims are stable.
The station reported that the boy was found shot in the front seat of a car with one of the 29 year old men in critical condition.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and police are investigating whether one of the injured was the assailant.
Detectives told CBS Philadelphia that multiple gunmen may have fired at each other.
The scene was filled with bullet casings of different assault weapons.
It certainly seems like a long-term conflict.
There were shelves on both sides of the street and sidewalk.
"This indicates multiple armed assailants were present and both were active", Philadelphia Police Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also damaged.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing security cameras.
Another 6-year-old girl was accidentally shot in the arm while playing outside her home in the West Oak neighborhood on Tuesday.
He's in recovery and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie are the reason we need you
I named this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team after her, and there's more than one reason for that.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three gymnasts who have inspired many girls of different ethnic backgrounds: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez.
The structure of this team, put together by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team is finally showing a similar appearance to America.
It also reinforces the presence of black and Latino women at the highest levels of the sport.
For the past four years, the first female gymnast has always been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were number one and number two.
That's a powerful thing.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America backed her.
Now the whole world will witness the extraordinary performances of Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, three World Champions, who have unexpectedly but skillfully demonstrated their gymnastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win the gold medal in the women's all-around.
And his teammate, Aly Raisman, won the silver medal.
We're looking at the best times of the sport, but that's not what it looks like at gyms across the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie followed the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
The reason they are the "Final Five" is that the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts and this will be the last year Marta Karolyi will coach.
But in reality gymnastics is a very expensive sport, and gymnasts work in private gymnastics clubs, primarily supported by parents who pay for training, travel, uniforms, competition, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and families), and many more fees.
Most of these gyms are located in affluent suburbs that can host these businesses.
These clubs are the only place gymnasts can train, and they require a costly and long-term commitment from the gymnasts' families.
Simone Biles' coach, Aimee Boorman, and Laurie Hernandez' coach, Maggie Haney, have been training these athletes since the day they started gymnastics.
We don't offer more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities for the countless young girls who are affected by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we've provided free, low-cost gymnastics training to over 15,000 youths (mostly black and Hispanic) in the city, based in Harlem, and we've coached both national and international champions.
In September, we're expanding to Detroit, where I grew up, to provide quality gymnastics training to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and enjoy this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops body strength, flexibility, and coordination, and provides mental hard work, discipline, and determination.
This combination offers long-term benefits in terms of health, school and work performance.
This team is going to inspire thousands of young girls to go to gymnastics, and that's great.
Participating in sports activities is very important, especially for girls.
We're going through a really exciting time.
Thank you for bringing the gold medal to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison as an Olympic team, clearly demonstrating the "Power of Girls", and motivating many young girls from diverse backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's offer was rejected, the assistant doctors decided to continue the strike.
Ministers had hoped the dispute would end after negotiations on an improved contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who took part in the vote voted against it.
In July, Mr Hunt announced plans to impose sanctions on the contract, stating that the NHS was "no one's property" and that further delays would hurt staff and patients.
The first group of physician assistants were transferred to a new contract, which included changes in their practice at night and on weekends to improve care outside of normal hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's physician assistants committee, said in a statement last night: "Physician assistants still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it will trigger the current workforce crisis and that there is no equal treatment of all physicians".
With only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new contract, progress is needed in this process, and time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve the dispute through dialogue were met with a reluctance by the government to intervene and in some cases deafening silence.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that the door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the sanctions, and listen to the concerns of the paramedics".
The paramedics have made it clear that they're prepared to step up the slowdown if he doesn't.
In the last strike, at the end of April, almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments were postponed, leaving nurses and counselors to take the place of the doctors on the strike line.
The ministers hoped that the dispute would end after negotiations on the improved contract with British Medical Association officials.
BMA wants a raise in weekend pay for the 54,000 contract physician assistants.
Daniel Mortimer, executive director of the NHS Employers' Council, has called on the paramedics to not go on strike.
"Grave solves nothing", said Mr. Mortimer, "but it puts pressure on already busy staff and services, causing anxiety, discomfort and distress to patients, caregivers and their families".
Over the past two months, we have continued our discussions with the Committee on Physician Assistants and have worked with the Ministry of Health and other authorities to address their concerns regarding the Oversight and Reporting Task Force in a positive manner.
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive communication on important issues - such as distribution, training flexibility, additional training for those taking a break, training costs, mutual agreement on curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - and the move to comply with the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May were a sign of how seriously employers were being taken by the UK Ministry of Medical Education and Health.
A drug that can eliminate the risk of heart attack at a cost of £2 a day.
After the authorities recommend that more people be given it for longer periods of time, thousands of heart attack patients will be able to benefit from the £2 a day drug.
Ticagrelor, which prevents clotting, reduces the risk of recurrent seizures for people with heart disease.
The drug was given for 12 months following the heart attack and reduced the risk of stroke or other seizures.
The NHS watchdog, NICE, recommended giving it to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS watchdog, NICE, has recommended giving it to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Every year, about 140,000 people in the UK have a heart attack, and one in four of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty substances accumulating in the artery walls to form plaque.
If the plaque breaks, it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood flow to the heart, and cause a heart attack.
And if the clot is dislodged, it travels through the bloodstream, blocking the flow of blood to the brain, causing a paralysis.
People who have had a seizure before are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, created by the UK firm AstraZeneca under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of clotting.
The draft NICE guidelines published today recommend that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg twice daily with aspirin for three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Center for Health Technology Assessment, says: "Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatments, about a quarter of those who have a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke, often with devastating results".
Fear of relapse can have a very negative effect on a person's quality of life.
Evidence suggests that the use of cicagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of recurrent heart attacks and strokes in people who have previously had a heart attack.
With the temporary introduction of Ticagrelor, we are pleased to have increased the treatment options available to the thousands of people who are waiting to benefit from it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor beyond three years is limited, including the risk of bleeding, the draft guideline does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
PC culture has increased voter corruption in Muslim areas
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was sacked for corruption following a government report last year.
As the devastating government report presented today shows, a culture of political correctness has led to the overlooking of widespread voter corruption in Muslim communities.
Former Cabinet Minister Sir Eric Pickles has rebuked the police, election observers and the town hall for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to "extreme sensitivity to ethnic origin and religion".
The former community secretary and current anti-corruption tsar said that the level of voter suppression on religious grounds is so bad that the police should be allowed to draw a ribbon outside the polling booths to protect fearful voters.
He suggested that voters carry their IDs with them to prove their identity when they vote.
In the present case, the selector simply states his name and address.
The report even recommends that permanent ink be applied to the finger during the voting process to prevent people from voting twice.
Sir Eric said that the whistleblower needs better protection.
He called for better access to the press on board documents and decisions of informal committees or working groups.
"This is not only to protect against electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it", he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets' vote scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled to remove Mayor Lutfur Rahman from office after repeated corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "shamefully abused" the religious sentiments of the Muslim community and silenced those who criticized him with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman was said to have "run his campaign on the basis that it is a religious duty for believing Muslims to vote for him".
Up to 300 of the games were suspicious or the result of using false identities, i.e. voting as if they were someone else.
Sir Eric has stated that there is evidence of fraud across the country.
He warned in particular about corruption in postal voting - where it was alleged that older members of the Muslim community were pressuring them to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric has made some suggestions for the voting system, including having identification with them to prove who they are.
The report contained the following statements: "Evidence has been obtained that some ethnic minority communities have pressured their valuable members, primarily women and youth, to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
"There were concerns that state institutions were ignoring such behavior because of "political correctness" based on extreme sensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
Sir Eric made 50 suggestions for the system, including preventing political activists from processing postal and ballot papers for "voting purposes".
The report, reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for tighter registration checks to prevent the electoral stake from being used for immigration and welfare corruption.
Consideration of the option that voters must show their identity before voting.
Permanent inking of the fingers after a vote to prevent any person from voting twice.
To carry out systematic checks on the sleep of the person to determine the suitability to vote.
Application of a three-year limit on requests for automatic mail voting.
Prohibition of political campaigners and activists from processing completed postal ballots and postal ballot envelopes.
The police are authorized to draw stripes around the polling booths.
Amendment of the law to facilitate the indictment of people under the Representation of the People Act, 1983.
It's illegal to take pictures at the polls.
The requirement that only English is spoken in the voting booths (except Galleries).
Strengthening the training of staff on the sanctions of the rule that voters should not enter the cabinet alone.
Sir Eric has harshly criticised the Police Service, saying it is "remarkable" that no charges have been brought in the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court ruled that there was no place for charges of corruption and illegal activities for Lutfur Rahman and his representative", he said.
He was found guilty on a number of grounds beyond a reasonable doubt, based on the nature of the criminal evidence.
He also criticized the ineffective "box marking checks" in the electoral registration departments of the city hall.
Sir Eric said: "The court decision in Tower Hamlets last year was a wake-up call.
While our nation is proud to have its parliamentary assemblies, the prevalence of this worrying and covert election corruption and the rejection of some institutions could damage that good reputation.
Being crazy about Kate's cyclist and other famous Rio Olympics analogues
This week, Rio 2016 Olympic fans went wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who proved to be remarkably similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian isn't the only athlete to take notice of her celebrity likeness as she battles for the gold this summer, at least social media thinks so.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous figures we've seen on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who look more like Hollywood celebrities than they do.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison (left), a member of the U.S. Men 's Archery Team , compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to Kate's resemblance to the bike path, many online people have suggested that an archer might look as much like Leonardo DiCaprio as his twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. Men's Archery Team, took to Twitter after photos surfaced showing his resemblance to the star of the movie The Money Hunter.
And the archer, noticing this social media craze, confessed that he'd been told he looked like Leo since he was a kid.
Brady told the Huffington Post: 'I don't think there's a very big resemblance except for the hair and beard.'
'He's a handsome man himself, so I guess that's a compliment.'
There's another analogy that's one of the most popular comparisons of London in 2012, and one that will undoubtedly draw even more attention this year: the incredible resemblance of British long jumper Greg Rutherford to popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina was said to be a close resemblance to Cuban-American artist Gloria Estefan, with her large and meaningful eyes.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Edit: This user states that Nathan is an 'athletic version' of the star of the Genesis movie
Tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett have long been compared to each other because of their sharp eyebrows and similar lips.
While the silver medalist of the Russian team has the same bronze skin and yellow hair as actress Annalynne McCord, her fans say that Nathan Adrian of Team USA 'looks like the athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.'
Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter star Jennifer Carpenter (right) with similar facial features and eyes
Not alone: One Twitter user was thrilled that others noticed the similarity
One theory that's still up in the air is that this user thinks there might be a reason why this couple looks alike.
One Twitter user expressed his happiness that "the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are like twins".
The American football star and Dexter actress actually has similar facial features and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include the nearly identical smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney, and the similar big smiles of Gabby Douglas, another gold-medal gymnast, and Gabrielle Union, star of the film Youthful Fire.
CBC Olympic spokesperson apologizes for commenting that Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-place finish in the 4x200m freestyle has angered viewers of CBC's live Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its speakers commented that the 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer "swept away like a bad smell" and "died like a pig" in the race.
When speaker Byron MacDonald began to express his views in the final of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay, he thought his microphone was off.
MacDonald, who was added to the CBC's "color" team, was heard to say: "The little Chinese boy of 14 has screwed up, baby".
He was so excited, he went like a bad smell and died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14), who finished the second leg of the flag race in 1:57.79, 1.61 seconds behind Canadian Taylor Rack, helped the Canadians close the gap between China and the United States.
The Canadian audience responded quickly after being puzzled by the tone and language used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "The CBC anchor just said the 14-year-old swimmer 'died like a pig'?"
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air.'
Ai Yanhan of China, 4 x 200m Freestyle Flag Race, was described as: '14-year-old little Chinese bagged a heavy one, baby.'
There was a very harsh and swift tweet about Byron MacDonald, and many of them were self-deprecating.
Twitter users couldn't help but notice how insensitive Byron Macdonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and you make us all look racist. #midebulant.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, the CBC's anchor, apologized for MacDonald's comment, saying: "We apologize for the comment made on the air regarding the swimming competition".
Those were really unfortunate words, we're sorry that this happened.'
The CBC had to apologize at least 90 times more than the people who tweeted in response to the comment.
Another speaker, Scott Russell, was forced to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
The CBC later copied and pasted this apology to over 90 Twitter users who had sent complaints about MacDonald's comments.
The network quickly issued a statement apologizing.
We wish to express our sincere regret that these statements were made and that they were released.
Last night, we quickly apologized on the air to our viewers, to our followers on social media.
We'd like to clarify that Byron's comments were not about the swimmer's personality, but about his performance.
However, these were rather inappropriate and unfortunate words, and Byron is deeply sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the air and tried to defend his words by saying he did not mean to make a personal attack.
"I want to apologize for a comment I made after the women's flag race last night", she told CBC's Olympic broadcast.
'I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not his personality.'
'No need to say, I didn't mean to disrespect you, and I'm very sorry.'
Primark customer vomits in anger at woman who tried on underwear in the middle of the store
Customers were left wondering what to do when a woman took off her underwear to try on underwear in the middle of Primark.
Worse, she looked at what it looked like on her, took it off and put it back on the shelf.
She kept looking, and then she tried on four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone.
The place where she tried on her underwear before putting it back on the shelf was the Primark store at Bouverie Place in Folkestone.
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was at the store at the time, said that after trying on the mysterious woman's underwear, she 're-dressed herself and left the store without taking anything.'
He himself said: "They could not believe their eyes".
He stood in the middle of the store and took out a pair of panties from the window, took off his panty sock and pants and put them on.
'He didn't try to find a particular place to do it, he stood out in all his disrespect.'
'Everyone was looking at him when he took off his pants and it was obvious he didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf.'
He tried three more laundry until he decided he didn't like anything, and then he went out of the store, dressed again.
'The people watching her seemed to care little and didn't think about who would buy the panties she tried on later.'
"It's disgusting to think that someone is going home with an unwashed underwear that someone else is wearing", said Ms. Davidson, 33, of Kent.
This incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
'I think the staff found the clothes and took them off the market after she left, which is a good thing,' Ms. Davidson added.
'It would be really sad to think that when I went home and got a new pair of panties, someone else was wearing them and taking them off and coming to me without washing them.'
A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday 9 August.'
The product concerned has been withdrawn from sale.
How to protect yourself from gun violence with Krav Maga
The outside world is quite dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com can help you be safer.
To learn how to deal with armed robbers at close range, we spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, headmaster of the New York-based Krav Maga Federation.
Whether you're approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the situation against the robber.
Mizrachi says when you're approached from behind, the first thing you do is turn your face, see the attacker, and "clear the line of fire".
Then you'll hold the gun between your forearm and shoulder and hit him in the face with your empty elbow.
Then, when you kneel on his cheek, the assailant's pain will be doubled, and in this stage, you will turn the gun and take it from his hand and you will hit him in the face with the barrel of the gun and the back of the gun up.
When the gunman approaches from the front, a similar technique is used: You pull your body away from the line of fire, grasp the weapon, and turn it so that the assailant cannot fire.
At the same time, you're going to give your weight to the weapon, punch the attacker through the chest area, turn the gun around, take it from him, and stretch it toward him.
Does that sound like a joke?
Check out the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, unless you're a master of Krav Maga, the safest way to avoid every robbery is to give your money to the robber.
Traveler Ian Wright stuck his tongue in Europe's dirtiest places for his travel guide
The English traveller has been put to a severe test of his immune system and scratching reflex by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Host and travel writer Ian Wright (51), of Suffolk, used his tongue to prove the power of the immune system by drawing on a Euro banknote, a Piccadilly Circus bar, the siphon button of a train toilet, and a speaker phone in Russia.
Before he licked each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what kind of business he was in.
But the experiment, which was to be made into a film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, yielded some surprising results.
While the idea of licking a siphon button in a trend that thousands of people are using is extremely disgusting, there are actually far more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Mr. Wright has consulted with doctors and medical experts on the growth of stomach bacteria and his health throughout his tour of Europe.
Luckily, nothing he licked had any effect except for the bad taste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright was known for traveling the world and testing his stomach's endurance by eating strange and wonderful things.
This mission, which stretched from general railroad railroad stations to toilet flush buttons, definitely tested the immune system.
In the film, he said: 'I was not very careful about my health from childhood, and I put everything from soil to worms to muddy water in my mouth.'
And throughout the film, he definitely proved the reason for his fame.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
The crawling sample showed luminometer counts over 4,000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
But when the luminometer count went above 4,000 units in the newly washed hands, when it was under 60, it was a Russian public toilet where he refused to lick.
Mr. Wright and Finnish dairy company Valio have produced a travel documentary called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
He said in the film, 'This is about to be one of the worst things I've smelled in a toilet.'
It can't get any dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting in there.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was developed in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as stomach bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help strengthen the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Senior Vice President of Snacks, Fruit Juices and New Categories at Valio, said: "We really wanted to offer something new to consumers.
Something that's fascinating to watch, and it's also going to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've had a lot of crazy brainstorming, and finally, we've got the idea of, "Let's call Ian".
They claim that interest in stomach health has become a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put products in a much larger context: the good and bad bacteria that surround us on a daily basis, the importance of gut health, and how it relates to the immune system.
The interest in digestive health is becoming a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we could provide consumers with more information about this in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
The film's director, Tom Hakala, added: "I'll tell you, if Ian had done something I wanted him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film, I would have lost respect for him".
Some things were naturally easy for Ian to lick, but some were quite difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty licking acts.'
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria with stomach health, and 58 percent said they used products containing lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
Maganda family destroyed social housing in Saltash, Cornwall, before evacuation
A Macanese family has caused £50,000 worth of damage to a social housing estate where they were evacuated on the pretext of frightening their neighbours.
After numerous complaints about Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock, they were evicted from their residence in Saltash, Cornwall.
When they were forcibly removed from the property, the housing association authorities were shocked to find the property in a state of disrepair.
There were large holes in the walls, floorboards had been torn down, garbage had been scattered on the floor, and graffiti had been written on the walls.
The family has now been removed from the residence and are believed to be taking advantage of private accommodation options.
Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, expressed concern that the situation was beyond repair.
He said: 'It's a real nightmare for people here and I think people shouldn't have to live like this.
There's a lot to consider because this property is now known as a very unpleasant part of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation and their name has a bad reputation.
The family had three sons who lived on the property on and off, and police said the family adopted a number of frightening behaviors, including street fighting with baseball bats, intimidating neighbors, drug use, drug dealing, and excessive shouting, arguments, and profanity.
In June, a judgment was issued for Skeldon, 47, who was named in the lease.
Old trash was found in many rooms of the demolished house
The flooring of the property where the drugs were sold in the past was removed
Neighbors said they saw them fighting in the street and police were frequently searching.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted him and his wife from the property this week after granting them an extended period of 11 weeks to move voluntarily.
The evacuation was welcomed by relieved neighbors who said their lives had become a nightmare.
One person said: 'No one cared.'
We've been living with them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
You wouldn't believe how many times we've seen cops here.
'This morning, we could not sleep.'
We woke up because it was so quiet, we're not used to it!
They're finally gone, and everything's gonna be great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a neighbourhood sanction officer at Cornwall Housing, said the family had not cooperated with local authorities.
The family had lived in this house for 20 years, and the police were often called to the property.
Garbage and old toys were thrown into the vegetated side of the social hall
He added: 'It is truly shameful that the tenant does not take any responsibility for the eviction of himself and his family, eviction has always been the last option applied for by Cornwall Housing.
It was a very difficult case because the behavior was so extreme and the actions were so frightening that the neighbors should not have witnessed them.
I greatly appreciate the efforts of my team, the Devon and Cornwall Police Force and the community members who have bravely come forward to provide us with information.
I hope this development will provide some relief to the neighbors and be taken as a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said he had three sons living on the property at different times, but they were in their 20s.
A dirty bed left on the floor in one of the bedrooms after the evacuation
Housing workers will have to clean up the garbage heaps around the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found over 70 grams of marijuana, scales, private items and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to sell.
He claimed to use the money to buy a headstone for his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After becoming homeless, it turns out Tanya and her husband are now staying in a private residence in Plymouth.
Most of the rooms in the house had murals on the walls.
Police said they will work to evacuate tenants who violate the rental rules.
Angela Crow from Devon and Cornwall Police said the evacuation was a warning to other tenants who continued to break the rules.
He said: 'This is a message to those who think they can do as they please without facing any accusation and that their actions will be in vain.'
The Devon and Cornwall Police Force, which will continue to work with its partners to protect the community, will never tolerate crime and antisocial behaviour.

The Air Force said it was a training flight, but insisted there was no safety risk.
This is when the tourists start to panic as the jet flies over the beach.
In dramatic footage, a military aircraft is seen approaching the sunbathers on the sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal, at near-contact level.
The vacationers stood up, understandably concerned about the noise of the jet engines, unable to see what was coming toward them through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon on the Costa Nova near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several vacationers who shared a video of the dramatic close-up on social media, said: 'Twice it really went down and at one point it looked like it was about to crash.'
Nuno Arroja added: 'I was surfing and I swear I felt like the plane was going to fall on me.'
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when the plane flew out of darkness at extremely low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify the fishing boats on the coast and that he had to go so low that it was the only way to check them.
The nearby power outage said the jet was flying lower than normal due to poor visibility from smoke from the fire, but the air force insisted no one's safety was at risk.
This summer, uncontrollable fires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to conditions that made it difficult to see (the power to extinguish was due to heavy fog and smoke from the fires).
The plane was on a training flight and as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
London girl student who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
It was reported that Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee stated that his family received information about his death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that he is believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrike on the Raqqa region, where the group is strong in the country.
The sultan was 17 years old and, according to his family, he died while planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
Akunjee said, "We hope this situation will highlight the risk of going to war zones as a tombstone and testament to others and discourage people from making this choice".
In February 2015, Sultana and two female students from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan's family was told that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and was widowed within months.
Reid has said he will not give up Garland as a Supreme Court nominee if Clinton is elected.
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid has expressed his belief that the Democrats will nominate Justice Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court if Hillary Clinton is elected president.
Republicans in the Senate have been blocking Garland's confirmation process since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the new president will choose the replacement for former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a video interview Thursday that he believes Clinton will choose Garland and that he "has reasons for that".
A spokesman for Reid later said he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether to nominate Garland and was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team did not want to "disrupt the status quo" by running a new election.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid said the Republicans who blocked Garland's nomination were "supporters" and "opponents" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was unfit for the job.
Treats stated that he was in favor of a 'naked calendar for men as well as women'
Treats magazine is collaborating with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by the 1970s Pirelli for 2017.
But instead of celebs and naked people, they're working to find the next generation of ball models for the 2017 NU Inspirational Fairies calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw stated earlier this year that the magazine, which has a high nudity rate, is different from the old Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I do it for the women.
Apparently, he believes the calendar is the same.
"We need to go back to the old fashioned, classic nudity, so that women, like men, can look at these images of the female body with ease as a source of inspiration", Shaw said in a press release about the calendar.
Women will want to be a part of this project because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can post photos online or attend open discussions in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl target: who are the actual buyers?
Middle-aged, lonely men love vinyl.
Before we go into the comment section to make a spectacular insult under the banner of Not So Middle-Aged Men, let us say that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed recycling of records is not the result of millennials pursuing innovation in a physical object, but a result of middle-age nostalgia.
The majority of vinyl album buyers are between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the least likely.
It's also not just because of the accumulation of curiosity; it's also emotional; older vinyl buyers tend to like to keep their feelings to themselves (56% and 53% respectively) and enjoy being alone (69% and 66%).
So are YouGov's results correct?
If this blog were a news story on television, the camera would have seen me walking down a crowded street in Soho in a modest gray suit, making many gestures before I stopped, and then I would have opened my hands and said something authoritative like, "Well, let's take a look".
Well, let's have a look.
While downtown Soho is slowly losing its charm and unusual air (buildings once housing independent dealers are now filled with hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases) there are still a few specialist record stores.
I would probably want him to stand in front of the camera for the next part, and I would stand next to different men in some of these stores and try to observe them and learn about their age and emotional state.
Stuart, 55, from Glasgow, whom I followed on his way from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, probably a woman in her 20s), is spending the afternoon in London for a meeting and looking through the shops to fill in a few hours of free time.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
He says, "I guess I am".
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, pictured above (he e-mailed me the official one, I didn't follow him home) adorn the walls of the living room.
The reason he collects so many albums and singles is partly because of his disposable income, which means he can now buy records that he didn't have enough money for when they first came out, and buy back what he sold when he was young and broke.
"Most of the stuff I bought in the late '60s and early '70s, stuff that I was 11 or 12 years old, too young to buy", he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more likely to be introverted, solitary people, adding: "I don't smoke, and I don't drink too much alcohol.
That's my bad mood.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, thinks most of the customers she meets fit the YouGov profile.
But he also noticed that a new wave of media hype was emerging, and that people who heard the fashion was coming back needed to buy back old records.
I've learned from interviews that he usually disposes of people's collections in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who used to sell vinyl to buy CDs are now selling CDs to buy back records".
This may explain the increase in the number of people of a certain age who recreate vinyl.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
It takes a few seconds to realize that in a store like Phonica, record stores offer a comfortable community of people with similar personalities.
According to Wez, some older customers were particularly offended by the contactless payment system.
Some vinyl enthusiasts may seek refuge in the stability of familiar record covers, which are overwhelmed by the digital world and recall their calm youthful memories.
"Sometimes it's because you want to fill a void or you see material things as a kind of comfort", says Wez.
I have it, as a collector myself, and I think most people have it.
That's an easy way to fill your head.
"We're like social workers", says one colleague, jumping off a pile of records.
A poll in April revealed that 50% of vinyl buyers last month had not yet listened to the album.
The survey also found that 41 percent had a pickup they never used, and 7 percent bought vinyl records even though they didn't have records.
At this point in the story, I would probably be looking at a series of bossa nova compositions with a very anxious look.
The "reward" aspect of this return is also an element that Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of Universe, noticed.
"Recently, someone came to me and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record to put on our shelf.'"
That's not a huge percentage, but it certainly reflects the current situation.
More produce, less music.
There are people who say, "I don't play records".
These are not old people, these are young people, in their late teens, newcomers to this subject.
Now, when I get to Fopp, who's dedicated almost an entire floor to vinyl, I see that the audience is quite variable.
Couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, young boys and middle-aged women.
The atmosphere is less tranquil than the aforementioned stores (the last track on Wild Beast) and the pop pop is more sex-oriented than the soothing jazz from the speakers, but it's good to see the diversity among the customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to decipher the psychological trauma that plagues them by standing next to someone for more than 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been at Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the discount records.
Instead of spending, he just went out to look at the showcases.
He says he doesn't have the option of collecting records because he doesn't make much.
It's too expensive.
It's easier to listen to music on the computer or in other ways, but the beauty of vinyl... " is gone with a loving sigh.
I don't know how to explain it, it's really unique.
My last stop is a store that's said to inspire a new generation of vinyl enthusiasts: Urban Outfitters.
I'm watching a group of teenage girls gather around Polaroid cameras for a while before a father and daughter argue over the purchase of a Crosley record player.
On the left is a stairwell filled with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac -- records that are not for the average collection -- a mix of modern and classic.
No one is looking; maybe it's just because they're decorative, some of them are too high to touch.
This is a "art vinyl".
But the interest in these items may mean the industry will make more money and send fewer customers into the depths of Soho; there's not much to complain about.
It's not surprising that a demographic with more money and time than most spends more money on more luxurious items like vinyl.
But my findings show that YouGov's findings are true, at least for Soho record stores, which are outnumbered, not counting the female collectors and vinyl enthusiasts who actually exist in record stores or online forums.
These people are probably working very hard at school or in the office.
These people certainly don't spend Thursday nights wandering around record stores on Berwick Street, looking at records and dodging the gaze of a fake 30-year-old TV presenter staring over the shoulders of middle-aged, clueless men.
Greenland shark, the world's longest living vertebrate - video news
Scientists have found that the Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied sharks, said the record belonged to a female, believed to be between 272 and 512 years old, who was five meters long
French court rejects proposal to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a proposal by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of convenience stores and restaurants in the Jungle camp, home to thousands of refugees.
In a court hearing this week, Calais officials argued that the state should demolish 72 shops where people in the camp sold a variety of products, from cigarettes to energy drinks, cut their hair or sold basic food for 50 cents (40p) for tea or a few euros.
The Calais Governorate argued that these sites should be demolished because they create a parallel economy that is tax-free and carries fire and hygiene risks.
The charity groups told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, and that free food provided by state-sponsored organizations and other groups was not enough for the growing population in the camp.
They argued that convenience stores and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the deportation of the 72-barrel shop owners, but the concerns of the governor of Calais were "fully understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants were doing more than just feeding people living in "extremely dangerous conditions".
He said these areas provide comfortable meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places in danger of being destroyed is the non-profit Jungle Book Cafe for Children, which serves 200 meals a day, offers English and French classes, and provides asylum advice to hundreds of underage refugees in the camp.
Over 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect this children's cafe.
A letter to the Guardian said the closure would be "a disaster for these children, some of whom are as young as eight".
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the population in the Jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 (the highest ever) after the number of arrivals increased during the summer.
After gold in the Fiji master class, Britain took silver in the rugby sevens championship
Britain's impressive run in the Rugby 7's Championship ended after a 43-7 defeat to Fiji in the final on Thursday at Rio Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji gave a master class in grip, pass, side step, support, running lines and muscle strength to win the first Olympic gold medal of any color.
After the defeat, Britain took the third silver medal of the day as a not-so-bad consolation prize and can now be proud of their efforts in the opening tournament of the Olympics 7 where they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Earlier in the day, he could have found them in the final after the South African team, who were beaten 7-5 in the semi-finals.
But a Fijian in such good form could still beat a 15-man team.
It's hard to believe, but maybe Britain can take solace in the thought that at least one Briton will wear the gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's head coach, Ben Ryan, an Englishman from Wimbledon.
It's been a pretty tough journey for Britain.
Eight rounds ago, when they were working with Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide Seven Championship.
This time, they only lost one.
While this is painful, the progress is truly astonishing.
Fiji got off to a fascinating start, with the players almost leaping past the British attempts to take the ball.
It was like running through a series of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, and the World Series champions were 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisao moved into the corner.
In the fourth minute, Jerry Tuwai came up against another number from the right wing.
The game was 12-0 and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant intervention prevented Leone Nakarawa from throwing the third, but it only delayed Fiji's tally.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored from the right corner and Great Britain fell behind 17-0
With just a minute left in the first half, Nakarawa scored another goal coming from the start.
Later Vatemo Ravouvou flew to the line for the score, passing through some tough British interventions.
With that, the score is 29-0 at halftime.
When Fiji was a team set up to play in the seven-team championship, Great Britain seemed to be just learning the basics.
That's kind of the point.
Great Britain made big changes in the middle of the circuit and closed the Fiji dam for four minutes, which was a good improvement from the first half, until Josua Tuisova came on stage with a perfect Fiji game.
Dan Norton made one try for Great Britain and although he tried to score from the left corner to make the score 36-7 the game was in the hands of the South Sea Islanders who were singing, waving the flag and dancing.
It was hard not to admire Fiji's cheerful approach from start to finish.
Maa Wiliame also loved the latest additions to the Fiji game that didn't need to be embellished at the last minute.
When the horn rang, Fijians began to celebrate, and Britain, in a state of ecstasy, made its way to the dressing room.
Earlier in the day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals, while Great Britain faced South Africa in a tough semi-final, with Britain leading by a single point.
Kyle Brown led the South African team in the first half, but Dan Norton led the way with his dizzying footwork and numbers in the second half.
The victory and silver medal were guaranteed by the brilliant intervention of Anthony's brother Marcus Watson, who was in the top 15 for England.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, inspired by their coach's fight with cancer, won the race.
There's no more emotional gold medal at these games, and that's a big deal.
After 220 agonizing breaths from first to last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning realized that the moment they won gold at Estacio da Lagoa could be even more meaningful.
Although there were two rowers, there were three voices on the boat, and their coach Robin Williams' voice echoed on the boat as they advanced to their second consecutive Olympic gold medal, becoming the first women to reach that level in the women's doubles competition this year in England.
Their dominance was clear, and it was their 39th race in an unprecedented unbeaten series.
While we see two great athletes floating on the surface in swanlike grace, this image does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
Behind every gold medal in rowing is a battalion of willing hands that make the difference, and no hand is as effective as the coaches who didn't know if they'd live to see this day when they were diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago.
Like he said, they touched and they left.
I had a type of bladder cancer that could be treated with surgery, and they did.
If they don't, it's going everywhere.
That would be pretty bad.
It changes your perspective on life a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
He was very lucky to have the trio start treatment in the off-season, early in 2014, which is not a good way to put it, but it would minimize distraction.
I needed to get paid, so I needed to get better fast.
That was a boost for me.
I was in the hospital, and they said that a few steps would be enough, but I was walking about six, nine, fifteen feet in the garden.
That's how it started.
Rowing is a journey in itself, but it makes it a little bit bigger.
After the victory, the minds were on Williams, who had spent a tense morning talking a little more than usual to overcome his own worries.
Stanning, a captain in the Royal Artillery who had previously been to Afghanistan, said: "I was emotionally devastated this week, which is maybe a little bit extreme, but it really means a lot".
It just goes to show what this means to me and how hard Helen, me and Robin have worked.
I had three wonderful years with Helen and Robin.
And neither would we be without Robin, so I want to give him my heartfelt thanks for being the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better person to work with or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The duo has a challenging rhythm that their rivals can't match.
Even in the final 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish teams closed the gap, Stanning and Glover were not exhausted.
We were caught up in that moment.
Helen was like, "Watch the process, watch the process".
It's really important not to get caught.
We got off to a good start, and we weren't trying to do anything incredible.
We didn't expect the fireworks to go off today, we just wanted to win the race we rowed well, which we did.
The two will take a year off before deciding what to do next.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month, his own and TV adventurer Steve Backshall's.
For now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
That would be too much pressure.
It took me six months to realize I was an Olympic champion in London.
It was so new and I was so stressed.
Here, it took about four minutes.
It feels so much better".

Bulgaria released inflation figures for the first time in 8 months
According to national statistics, monthly inflation in Bulgaria was at 1 percent in June.
This is the highest value in years (since June 2012) and the first value above zero since October, after a positive value of 0.2% last year.
The average annual inflation rate measured by the CPI for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was -0.8% compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (comparison of July 2016 to December 2015) was -0.2%, and the monthly inflation difference between July 2016 and July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, compared to the previous month, price increases were observed in the following consumer product groups: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), entertainment and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in the clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and routine care (0.5%) and healthcare (0.1%).
Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education remained the same.
Snapchat "anime" effect criticized as Asian cartoon
While Snapchat claims to be inspired by animation for this filter, some observers have expressed that it is racially insensitive.
Snapchat enables 150 million users every day to play with their identities on an absurd level, altering their reality through the lens.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character jumping out of a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
Lenses are reckless, feature-changing devices that generate over 30 million enhanced gravitational waves every day.
Misplaced steps are quickly etched into the public memory.
Snapchat lenses have faced accusations in the past that the app promotes black classification or presents bleached skin tones as a beauty ideal.
So, because of the lens they introduced this week, which left users with squinting eyes, broken teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics criticized the company as being an "Asian mask" that caricatured Asians.
And they wondered if these recurring conflicts pointed to a bigger problem with the company's diversity.
The news and fury spread with news from The Verge and Motherboard on Wednesday, and Snapchat announced the feature was removed a day later.
The company made a statement: The mirror was not designed to caricature Asians, but to honor the anime characters.
But for observers with experience in racism, the lens reminded them of painful stereotypes.
Others have generally rejected the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "painful and uncomfortable in the slightest".
"It's hard to argue when it comes to comparing the effects of the bad Asian cartoon and the filter side by side", he added.
Which means that the filter is not just an Asian mask, but a degradingly Asian mask.
Snapchat isn't the only company that's overcome cultural triggers.
American culture seems to be in a constant struggle for diversity and inclusion in many areas, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And the broad youth audience that Snapchat is addressing, which is more racially diverse than its other counterparts, can also be interpreted as having a higher sensitivity expectation.
In an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates a demeaning image for a user, "it's much harder not to notice that kind of behavior as it used to be".
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and called everyone to do the same.
In an article for Medium and a telephone interview, she stated that she believed the race conflicts reflected a lack of diversity in Snapchat's hiring practices.
Ms. Zhu ended her article by criticizing the company's leadership team, which is mostly made up of white men, with a tag: #SnapchatiSilin.
"Either the different races in the staff are not sufficiently diverse to make such decisions", said Ms. Zhu, an American of Chinese descent, "or the people who work there are not safe or comfortable enough to talk".
Other observers share his views on the complaint, which Snapchat largely left unanswered.
The company is not sharing figures on diversity among its staff, emphasizing its private company status.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to share the racial origins of its staff, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently added a hiring manager to its staff to focus on underrepresented populations and increase its internal inclusion efforts.
Ms. Zhu, for her part, stated that she would keep her Snapchat account off, adding, "I wonder if they need more users like us who can say that this is not true".
Congress panel says military officials misrepresented ISIS intelligence
In a report released Thursday, a congressional panel reported that United States Central Command officials misrepresented intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground.
An interim report prepared by a working group of Republican council presidents from the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts who said their superiors had altered assessments of Islamic State by American forces.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military headquarters located in Tampa, Fla., that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
A news release on the report stated: "Intelligence findings confirmed by senior Centcom leaders typically paint a more positive picture of U.S. counterterrorism efforts than the facts on the ground and consistently yield far more positive results than analyses by other elements of the intelligence community".
California Republican Representative Ken Calvert said, "What happened at Centcom is unacceptable, and our combat troops are suffering from poor analysis of the top decision makers".
The failure of the leadership at Centcom has reached the highest levels of the organization.
The 10-page report also details the ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015 that were part of the Central Command's explanation and analysis of the U.S. training efforts for Iraqi forces.
Although there is no concrete evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be altered, analysts are reportedly feeling pressure from Centcom leaders to offer a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS and the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.
The report states that "in the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional statements were significantly more positive than actual events".
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military offensive to retake Mosul could be launched as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
Republican Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas said in a statement that "after months of research, this is now quite clearly understood".
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the most senior intelligence leaders of the United States Central Command manipulated the intelligence results of the commander to paint the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq as insignificant.
Republicans have formed a task force after analysts raised concerns about the manipulation of intelligence on the Islamic State.
As the review continues, the report, released Thursday, will follow much more comprehensive findings.
There is another Centcom intelligence review being conducted by the DOD Inspector General.
The Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee also released their own findings Thursday, which agree with some of the conclusions reached by the Republican task force.
The committee's Democratic chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff, said in a statement that "between 2014 and 2015, Centcom has formed an extremely narrow-minded process in its intelligence assessments of ISIS and Iraqi Security Forces".
According to Mr. Schiff, this process "has delayed the release of intelligence results", has led to a breakdown in morale among analysts, and has "not given enough room for contrary opinions".
However, Mr. Schiff and the Democrats have said they have not found any evidence that the White House pressured Centcom analysts into fabricating the results of a "predetermined or political narrative".
The preliminary results of the congressional review were announced by the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported that a Pentagon inspector general's review was available following complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the inspector general would not comment on the DOD congressional report while the review continues.
However, he said that "experts may disagree on the interpretation of complex data in some cases, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense support healthy dialogue on these important national security issues".
The research will echo beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing operation in Iraq and Syria is continuing (an argument raised by more and more Defense officials every day).
But the accusations made last year have raised questions about how much President Obama can trust the Central Command to make honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other hot spots.
Criticism of the Islamic State's intelligence coverage began when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote an article stating that the administration of President George W. Bush had advocated a small force presence in Iraq despite the objections of many analysts and had not given enough thought to the aftermath of the 2003 invasion, and has been debated for more than a decade.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the insurgency against Islamic State intelligence.
Officials said they concluded that despite public statements to the contrary last year, Mr. Hooker's team concluded that the airstrikes against refineries held by ISIS had not significantly affected the financial resources of the terrorist group, as they had built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But as The Times reported in September, the findings were not outside Central Command.
The Senate statement last year by then-Commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by many lawmakers as a highly positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was succeeded in the Central Command by General Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. Women's Field Hockey Team, preparing to face Great Britain, has won its fourth consecutive title.
Katie Bam scored the first two goals of the United States women's field hockey team in the Americans' 3-0 win over India on Thursday, a day after she scored three goals in the 6-1 victory over Japan.
Although five goals in two matches seems to require a lasting mastery, Bam, 27, said he wasn't sure if he'd done the same before.
He said, "I have no idea".
I'm not one of those people who keeps score.
What he knows is that the Americans are 4-0 up in the Olympic tournament and share first place in the group with Great Britain, who are on their way to an undefeated 2-0 win over Japan on Thursday.
Great Britain and the United States will face off in the final game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams qualified for the quarterfinals, and the match will determine who finishes first and second in the six-team group.
The team that finishes first in their group matches will not face the strong Dutch team, the leader of another group, for a little longer when the quarter-finals begin.
But after Saturday's game, the Americans made a sensation by making a surprising improvement here after the London Olympics, where they finished last out of 12 teams.
Bam was on this team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., where he first picked up a grass hockey bat at age 3 (his twin sister was in Drexel), and at age 16, he became the youngest player on the national team.
He missed the 2008 Olympics because he didn't make the final roster.
Then came 2012, when most things didn't go well for him and his teammates.
The following year, an English coach, Craig Parnham, was brought on board, and things began to change.
Bam says, "It's a cultural change, a mental change, a physical change".
We don't work like we did in London anymore.
We've been through a complete transformation.
On Thursday night, Bam took the first number of the first half with a close reverse.
India had not yet won the tournament but the team managed to maintain the score 1-0 until the third quarter when Bam came on.
He made a long run with the ball from the left of the field and then curled up and threw it into the goal, giving the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzales scored the final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
This was the first time that United States goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who allowed one goal in his first three victories, did not score in the tournament.
He's got a shot.
So is Bam.
Parnham said, "We're in a good place right now, but how good this place is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game".
Trampoline Swing in the Midst of Olympic Ambition
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, the Olympics are going on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro represent a competitive and ambitious work that seems to never end or be inevitable.
The Olympic torch itself is like a flaming baton that's passed from swimmer to gymnast and then to triathlete.
You can't watch TV, read the paper, or listen to your neighbor in a cafe without hearing about the fight between Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Mr. Dooley, a first-time Olympian, might be one of the names featured in prime-time, among sponsorships and TV commercials that tell you to feel good, like a gamely heartbeat jumper, like a swimmer, gymnast or fighter.
But Mr. Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for the Olympic gold medal in trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event equally.
Far from the center, in the shadows, there are sports that are not universally recognized: air rifle shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
The frog will always be with us, and long be it.
But if I have to say my personal favorite, I'd like to point out the hidden magic of the trampoline.
Although trampolining has been recognized as an Olympic event since it was introduced at the Sydney Games in 2000, very few people I've asked in the 16 years since have realized that it's an Olympic sport.
It could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to compete, she never won a medal in trampoline and did not have a competitor advance to the finals until 2012.
In men, the Chinese and Russians tended to share the prizes, and in women, the Chinese and Canadians.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will try to defend their gold medals this year in London.
But trampolining is noted as a somewhat oppressive activity, partly because it may be thought by unconscious ears to be worthy of clown school rather than the Olympics.
I must admit I'm no expert here, I'm just interested in the subject.
It has comic potential (like the cartoon-like tremor of the never-ending jump) but also reflects the elegance of the two sports it essentially combines, gymnastics and diving.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word for hand trampoline, which means "trampoline".
The champion candidates jump almost 30 feet in the air on a large trampoline and are asked to perform a series of movements (bouncing, pike and hop) before landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are judged by performance, difficulty and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries will compete in Rio, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common progression in the Olympics is straight forward.
The medalists must go further, faster and higher in their quest for gold, sometimes to the finish line, sometimes backwards, upwards, downwards.
They're not just chasing the finish line or the starting line, but there's another challenging line on the air, the world or the Olympic record.
This determined effort is noble, enviable, and even extreme, enough to bring even an audience to tears.
But that's one of the things that I find a little tiring watching the Games.
The trampoline gives you a break from all this.
Those on the trampoline move upwards.
Their goals are not forward movement.
It jumps up, looks weightless like an astronaut, rises, lands, and then climbs back up effortlessly.
Of course, it's not that there's no competition or difficulty, but there's a lot of work to do to get to the end of the routine, no getting lost in the distance, just the graceful suspension of time and gravity, like a fantasy.
The more quiet an Olympic race can be.
The women's qualifiers and then finals will be held Friday afternoon at 1 p.m. Eastern time; the men's on Saturday at 1 p.m.
NBC will broadcast the finals on both days in the afternoon block beginning at 2:00 p.m.
Right in the middle of the Olympic frenzy, they're promising a quiet and wonderful moment that can be ignored in the general hype.
And if awareness is going to increase by offering male athletes just to peek and objectify, as suggested by male gymnasts in the United States recently, according to The Wall Street Journal, we can say that Mr. Dooley is waiting for new fans.
"A generation in protest" in Ethiopia, longtime US ally
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
In Ethiopia, protesters demanding political change have faced fierce government resistance.
Witnesses say a number of protesters were fatally shot in clashes with police.
Ethiopia is about to collapse?
In the last decade, it has become one of the most stable nations in Africa and a staunch ally for the West with its fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have rocked the country, spreading to more and more areas.
Just last week, thousands of people took to the streets demanding fundamental political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response was quite brutal.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
The protest footage, believed to be from late last year or early this year, shows security officials whipping young people who were forced to stand with their hands against a wall.
The UN's top human rights official is now calling for a thorough review.
Rashid Abdi, project director for the Somali Peninsula at the International Crisis Group, a research group, said: "It has always been difficult to hold this country together and it will be much harder to move forward".
Ethiopia is one of the most populous nations in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is appreciated by the West.
The American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat the terrorist threats in the region, primarily in Somalia, and there are few countries in Africa that have received such help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is growing at an impressive rate.
The infrastructure has been improved to a remarkable extent, with a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia did not exhibit the best example of democracy (human rights groups have consistently cited the government's repressive stance), domestic opposition was quite limited, with dissent effectively silenced.
Many were exiled, imprisoned, killed, or driven to the farthest reaches of the desert.
But that may be about to change.
"If you suffocate people and give them no choice but to protest, these things will happen", said Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer from central Ethiopia.
The youth is all in protest.
A generation in protest.
There are many complaints, from land use to the pressure exerted by the ruling coalition on power.
After last year's highly-criticised election, the ruling party and its allies also took the last seat filled by the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea, a sharp and contentious line that led to a war in June that killed hundreds.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Freedom Front or the Ogaden National Freedom Front, which have disappeared in recent years, could rearm themselves using this turmoil.
There are several factors that explain why the bitter feelings that have been boiling beneath the surface for years are now erupting.
The first one seems innocent: smartphones.
As cheap smartphones became more common and internet access became available, only a few years ago, large numbers of Ethiopians began to communicate using social media.
Even when the government shut down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often did during protests, most people were able to communicate via proxy servers that concealed their location.
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered in this way for protests.
Second, there has been an increase in solidarity between the Oromo and Amhara, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups.
The Oromo and Amhara are not normally allies.
For too long, the Amhara people of the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia have dominated politics and business, exploiting the mostly Muslim Oromo people who live in the plains.
But that's changing.
Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader, said, "We are moving towards coming together under one umbrella and cooperating".
The largest protests were seen in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many Amhara and Oromo believe that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military, intelligence, commerce and politics.
The third cause of the unrest was the death of Meles Zenawi.
Former rebel leader Mr. Meles served as Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until he died of an undisclosed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see what no one else could.
Analysts say he is especially adept at detecting the first signs of unease and calming and neutralizing opponents.
Conflict analyst Mr. Abdi said, "The current regime does not have this basic knowledge".
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was elected in relative uncertainty to replace Mr. Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who is from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say he has failed to gain the trust of the Tigrayan-controlled security services.
The result was more fear, more bloodshed.
Ethiopia's latest experience with this kind of confusion was in 2005 when thousands of people protested after the government's theft of a fraudulent election, according to analysts.
In the ensuing measures, many protesters were killed, although less than in the previous month, and this period of turmoil passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train, and for the remarkable progress made in fighting poverty.
Clearly, however, this did not stop the growing resentment against the Ethiopian government.
And it's becoming dangerous and ethnic.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked Tigrayan-owned businesses, and Tigrayan hatred is on the rise on social media.
Analysts say the protests have left the United States and other Western allies in a strange position.
The US government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, but it was recently reported that the base was closed.
While the West is openly committed to supporting democracy, it does not want to see its already fragile ally disintegrated.
"It's like walking on a very thin rope", Mr. Abdi said.
Donald Trump called Obama's claim that he founded ISIS "mockery"
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to defuse the latest controversy surrounding his campaign by insisting that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were not serious when he repeatedly claimed that they were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group last week.
This announcement raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate openly with the American people.
It also put the statement that he was implying that his deputies were doing everything they could to defend him in this chaotic process into a strange position in the process of trying to explain that this was not the case.
Mr. Trump, after making this suggestion at a rally on Wednesday night, further reinforced his thesis on Thursday by insisting in interviews that the president and Mrs. Clinton were really implying that she was founding ISIS.
But in a tweet early Friday morning, Mr. Trump said he was merely making a sarcastic statement.
The message showed Mr. Trump stepping back completely from the day before, when he stated in a series of interviews that he was serious about the accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump soften that interpretation, reminding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate said he didn't believe it.
Mr. Trump has emerged in recent turmoil as he tries to shift the focus of his campaign after the polls plummeted.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton had conflicting talks this week in Michigan about the economy.
On Friday, Mr. Trump wanted to get back to that.
He also tweeted that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would raise taxes and that he found his speech boring.
Mr. Trump has used the mocking defense before.
In late July, after he faced heavy criticism for appearing to suggest that Russians had hacked Ms. Clinton's emails, he explained his comments, "Of course, I said that in a sarcastic way".
This approach allows Mr. Trump to push the boundaries of political discourse and step back where necessary.
"It's a system that allows him to 'explain' in a way that depends on the reaction, by testing how certain messages are perceived by his supporters", said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who tracks the language used by both candidates.
But at the same time, he's making these statements deliberately, and he knows that they're too vague to filter through different lenses.
After a recent drop in the polls, Mr. Trump has taken a much more aggressive stance, rather than softening the mood for the general electorate.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed Mr. Trump far behind Mrs. Clinton in North Coraline, Virginia and Colorado, and there's a tight race in Florida.
Although Mr. Trump usually avoids apologizing for provocative things he says, he accuses his critics of misrepresenting his words or not understanding his humor.
But Mr. Trump's jokes, which have come under much scrutiny in the final months of his presidential campaign, are putting his loyal supporters, as provocative as his comments may be, in a difficult position to support him publicly.
Former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump's most prominent supporters, did his best to defend the nomination in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
When asked about the validity of Mr. Trump's thesis that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton founded the Islamic State, Mr. Giuliani said, "I think he's making a legitimate, political critique".
In a way, ISIS was a little unknown organization before Obama, and those who found it cute were completely wrong, and that was because of the withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Most prominent Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, with Mrs. Clinton as secretary of state, has failed to deal aggressively with the situation in the Middle East and has caused the growth of ISIS.
Ahead of Friday's rallies in Pennsylvania, Trump continues to accuse the news media on Twitter of distorting every word and bias against him.
"They can't do it!" he said, mocking the "poor, pathetic" TV experts who tried to solve him.
Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's excuse, saying it was proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
We're back at Greenpoint, the once priceless cafe.
The Verb Cafe, an old cash-only place in Williamsburg, had been serving great coffee for 15 years, even though it didn't offer Wi-Fi.
Naturally, he couldn't handle the prices at his store on Bedford Avenue.
In the summer of 2014, the store that replaced Verb sells soap in the shape of a cupcake.
The residents complained that this was the last loss of the civilized city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted, "New York is a change, I know that, but I still can't believe that CBGB is gone and the Chelsea Hotel is empty and Verb is no longer a soap shop".
But New York is a city of reinvention as much as it is change.
Last November, a refurbished Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb Cafe has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards but retains some former employees and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee's still good.
The new Verb is headed by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe and owner and CEO of the new location.
He joined Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
He said that when a client offered him funding for this new place, he would be thrilled to do it.
Mr. Rodriguez, 36, left most of the stuff the same.
Verb uses the same distributor for the Sims, and he bought an espresso machine of the same model.
Even the old Verb's lights were reused here.
But Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to offer a little bit of experience.
He added new materials.
Bacon-and-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are on the menu and include ingredients such as capers and pickled onions.
They have brown rice bowls.
The cafe no longer serves beer but fresh fruit juices.
Nine months later, Mr. Rodriguez said he noticed the old defense began to come in steadily.
He said, "Many of our old customers couldn't handle the prices in Williamsburg".
Last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those customers.
Ms. Oliveira, 34, lives in Williamsburg and used to go to Verb's.
Even after moving to Greenpoint, he didn't stop moving forward.
He said he stopped drinking coffee for a while after the verb was closed.
"I realized what I loved was the coffee and the culture at Verb", he said.
Now he's started drinking coffee again, but the other day he chose a new additive, a tea blend, instead of his usual iced coffee.
Tom Rosenthal, another defensive lineman, has been a regular at Verb since 2003.
He goes there before work and always orders the same thing.
"Every day, quarter past seven, I would walk in without a hitch and they would make my daily order of buttermilk", she said.
Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to make a change and add new ingredients to the menu.
These days, Mr. Rosenthal still takes his usual order, but sometimes he makes a little change to his daily order of bacon, eggs and cheese.
Mr. Rodriguez said he wasn't too fond of the soap shop that replaced the old place.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb using the coffee's cold brew.
Mr. Rodriguez said, "I think we can still accept this offer".
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have embraced this cafe.
One of the new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said that he would soon find a place to display the menu so that his new neighbors would feel good about themselves.
There are other advantages to the new position.
Local juice store wants to bottle and sell cold brew coffee.
There's a possibility that the cafe could expand into the adjacent building.
For most customers, it's enough to have a new Verb available where they can find their old favorites.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and was very upset when the place closed.
When the new place opened, Mr. Whitt said that being able to walk in and get coffee made him feel at home.
"I should have smelled it", he said.
In the book "A Square Meal",
In March of 1933, shortly after taking office, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.
A throat-deep man, President Roosevelt loved the fancy Fifth Avenue foods, such as goose liver stew and Maryland turtle soup.
The menu was much more modest: boiled eggs with tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and dried peach pudding for dessert.
"It was an act of solidarity with those who were suffering about food", said Jane Ziegelman.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat".
A couple from Brooklyn Heights, food historian.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey", was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Ms. Ziegelman, in her book, "97 Orchard", was about life in the nightclubs in the Lower East Side through food.
Their new book, "A Square Meal", to be published by Harper's on Tuesday, tells the story of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They met with a reporter for dinner at the Eisenberg Sandwich Buffet in the Flatiron district, which has been in existence since 1929, the year the crisis began, in solidarity with food.
Mrs. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, preferred turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable seats.
The couple found the reporter's order of rolls suitable for discussing their crisis-era meals.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "The salmon was very popular".
There was peanut broth, liver broth, dried beans broth.
They were made of a material and a cheap thing that spread the material.
Imagine you've had enough peanuts for dinner.
Mr. Coe, he's got a sour face.
"It must have been sitting in your stomach like a bullet".
In the years before the crisis, especially in rural America, the tables were open buffets.
Women cooked for the men who worked on the farm, and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Americans were sending food to starving Europeans in World War I. "A Square Meal" tells the story of how the nation suddenly ceased to be a center of abundance and coped with it.
Mr. Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about this subject, saying, "It was a time when food became a central concern for Americans".
The new budget regime was equally worrying: mystery foods like bacon and stews became staples, which Ms. Ziegelman noted "were a great way to evaluate leftovers" so cooks could hide the appetizers underneath with a creamy sauce cover.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
For years, meat, at the heart of American cuisine, has become a luxury that is rationally distributed.
Interesting mixtures were tried for calorie and nutritional value, and the feeling of satiety took precedence over taste or general cuisine.
While Mrs. Ziegelman was researching her book, which included recipes, she prepared an onion meal in a bakery filled with peanut butter from that era.
Mr. Coe said, "This was not a favorite addition to the dinner table".
Ms. Ziegelman backed it up: "It was unreal".
Peanut butter has nothing in common with baked onions.
This was a prominent feature in most household economics descriptions.
Between 1923 and 1943, home economists, including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Home Economics Bureau, steered the nation's eating habits as never before.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraging women to be "artificial", and they spread the fight to turn confectionery into delicious food, such as carrot-and-cream spaghetti.
A Square Meal is a feast of historic treats.
The government's response to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "Let me have cake" attitude, is extremely appetizing.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse food of his childhood, he ate the food of the millionaire intellectual he had become.
Mr. Coe said, "He liked to eat European delicacies like fish and salad dressing".
He ate his dinner in a dining room almost entirely covered in gold, wearing evening gowns.
It was far from the truth.
If his wife Eleanor hadn't encouraged him to be a good example with his stomach, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
The book says that when Mrs. Roosevelt hired an assistant who had no regard for taste, the White House began to serve "not only the saddest food ever prepared, but also the most dismally prepared dishes".
After the country got back on its feet, many of the cooking methods of the crisis were set aside.
Ms. Ziegelman believes that the calorie- and nutrition-focused understanding and application of science to cooking continues.
The couple stated that while writing the book, they learned a lot from Ms. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits - for example, she never threw food in the trash.
Mr. Coe said, "The food waste really scared him".
Ms. Ziegelman said of her past memories, "It was really making people sick".
There was a cream-doughnut incident.
After the dishes were collected at Eisenberg, she and Mr. Coe brought out a homemade dessert: the peach-dried dessert that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "It's called a chopped dried plum", and she added, "The trick I've been most often asked to do is to give these modest recipes a cool name".
No whipped cream, just dry peas, some flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone hesitated to dip their spoons in the brown glue.
Surprisingly, it wasn't too bad.
Mr. Coe took the second and third spoons.
"A little sliced nut would be nice", he said to his wife, as if he were a thrifty man.
He 's gonna get paid by Gilead in a patent fight with Merck for hepatitis C .
In a decision by a U.S. district judge, Gilead Sciences Inc. won the right to collect attorney fees in a patent case against the drugmaker Merck & Co. Inc. for hepatitis C.
After a U.S. judge found Merck guilty of a series of misconduct, including perjury and other unethical practices, Gilead was fined $200 million in June for violating two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni.
At Thursday's hearing, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman ruled that Gilead was entitled to compensation for the costs incurred during the defense.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, the market leader with its next generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of liver patients.
The lawsuit dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other over ownership of laboratory studies for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
US-backed forces say they have completely taken control of Membich from ISIS
On Friday, the group's spokesman said that U.S.-backed forces and the last ISIS fighters inside the city had completely taken control of the northern city of Membiç, near the Turkish border.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are clearing the city after a group of remaining militants hiding in the city left.
Sharfan Dervish, of the Membich Military Council, which is allied with the SDG, told Routers that they had released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by the militants.
He told Reuters: "The city is now completely under our control, but we are conducting clean-up operations".
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% federal taxes.
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which show that the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband earned $10.75 million last year and paid the current federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clinton family contributed $1 million to charities, most of it to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned about $5.3 million in speaking fees, and former Secretary of State reported earning $3 million for a book published by Simon & Schuster about his time at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, released their 10-year tax return.
They paid 20.3 percent federal taxes in 2015.
Clinton campaign official Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement, "Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency".
In contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false pretences about his earlier promises to disclose his tax returns and backs down.
Although not required by law, it is a tradition for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers said the reason for the rejection of the statements was an audit by the Internal Revenue Service.
In connection with the Democratic candidate's statements, Clinton campaign official Ian Sams tweeted, "Your turn".
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel Michael Cohen told CNN he would not allow Trump to broadcast these until the audits were complete.
The group, which included 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, criticized Trump, saying the rejection raised questions about his selflessness, contributions to charities, business deals and many other connections, including with Russia.
Clinton went on to post an online video on Friday showing top Republicans pressuring Trump to disclose his taxes.
He raised the issue at an economics talk in Michigan on Thursday.
He told the crowd, "He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, to release his tax returns".
Politico reported that Trump paid almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and on Friday, a New York Times business columnist shared statements from a number of tax lawyers and accountants that the situation may still be continuing.
Federal tax rates have become a major issue in the presidential election.
Clinton proposed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffet that would allow those earning more than $1 million a year to pay at least 30 percent in taxes.
President Obama supports that proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, who operates the Berkshire Hathaway group, challenged Trump to come and file his tax return.
Buffett said he was under IRS scrutiny and that Trump was "afraid" of voters, not the tax collector.
Clinton released his campaign tax returns up to 2007.
The Clintons, who currently live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and the combined tax rate is about 40.5 percent.
The Clinton family's 2015 statement shows that, unlike most Americans, their income is only about $100 in wages.
Their main investment is a low-cost index fund, and the Clintons have reported a net income of $109,000 in dividends and interest.

Powdered red pepper condoms, chestnut fireworks to help protect elephants in Tanzania
To prevent elephants from entering human settlements, conservationists in Tanzania are using an unusual method - throwing powdered red pepper condoms at them.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation and the US-based Nature Conservation Association, which came up with the idea a few years ago, have taken steps to promote it, training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania on the nonviolent, four-step method of protecting their homes and crops from harm to animals.
Most people used to use a spear to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the vehicle kit, we've seen a shift in attitudes in these communities, where they're more confident that they can keep elephants off their land without harming them", said Damian Bell, managing director of Honeyguide.
The first two steps involve holding a flashlight and blowing a horn.
When that's not possible, they throw what's called a "red pepper cloud".
Powdered red pepper mixed with soil is put into the condom with a chestnut fuse, only the tip is closed to leave the funnel open.
When burned, the condom opens with a bang and red pepper powder is sprayed into the air.
One breath is enough to send the elephants in the opposite direction.
The last resort is to use a clamp that fires firecrackers into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
Jewish filmmaker knocks down hotel in Berlin that removed Israel's phone code at "Arab demand" - RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin caused a sensation in the media after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not list the Israeli telephone code and that the employee was pushing the "demands" of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, one of the authors of the documentary "Shoah" about the genocide, expressed his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German broadcaster FAZ.
Lanzmann tried to find Israel on a list of telephone codes provided by the hotel during his short stay.
But the country was not among the states that could be searched directly from the room.
How can Israel be left out of the picture and destroyed in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, in 2016?
It was Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers Israel a call through its own call center.
The filmmaker reported the situation to the hotel reception for an explanation.
Lanzmann wrote that the response he received "shocked him".
The hotel's secretary stated that this measure was taken by "a deliberate decision of the Kempinski-Hotels management".
The underlying cause of this movement has made the filmmaker even more angry.
According to Lanzmann, the employee said, "Many of our guests have asked for the deletion of the Arab and Israeli code".
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the situation "a great shame".
We were shocked and surprised.
That's a shame.
It's a bigger shame that this happened in Germany and in a hotel chain like this.
That doesn't need to be explained.
We're waiting for the hotel to draw the necessary conclusions".
The incident sparked a huge online reaction, with people calling it a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of "becoming compliant" to the alleged demands of its Arab customers.
In another message, the hotel was located on Kurfurstendamm Street near a synagogue, with the words "Shame on you".
According to Der Spiegel, the hotel quickly dropped the charges, saying the incident was the result of "negligence" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann.
Suddeutsche Zeitung stated that one of Kempinski's representatives said that "there was never a direct order that Israel should not be included in the rapid search list".
And he said they'd added the code now.
Police used pepper spray and plastic bullets against Brazilian protesting students
Students in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo clashed with police on Thursday to protest government reforms on the public education system.
Police used pepper spray and plastic bullets against protesters.
The problem started when the police officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the police using plastic bullets and pepper spray.
Hundreds of students joined the demonstration to express their dissatisfaction with the plans.
According to a proposal by the governor of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, less than 100 public schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be distributed to other schools in order to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing against the interim president, Michel Temer.
The latest protest came days after protesters took to the streets in support of ousted President Dilma Rousseff, who was voted out of office by the country's senate.
Trade between Russia and Iran rose to 71% - RT Business
According to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan, with the lifting of sanctions, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
The ambassador expressed that since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, the interest of Russian companies doing business in the country has increased significantly.
While new companies are preparing to gain market access, Russian companies are maintaining existing ties with Iran.
Of course, further growth of trade is one of the main priorities of our bilateral cooperation with Iran", Dzhagaryan said.
In the first five months of 2016, the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015, reaching 856 million dollars, he said.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran increased by 91.5% to $697 million.
Russia's imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
This increase in trade was achieved with machinery, ground vehicles and consumables for weapons", the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to come to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mostly for travel.
Also, for the first time, Iran was among the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
We can say that the record of Iranian tourists visiting Russia last year will be broken".
At the same time, relatively fewer Russians are visiting Iran, which is something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yezd, where the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization are well preserved", he said.
Cash to FETO from Izmir - Economy News
Interesting details began to emerge about the Kavuklar Group Board of Directors Chairman Abdullah Kavuk and the Küçükbay Group Board of Directors Chairman Ahmet Küçükbay, who were detained for providing financial support to FETO.
It was found that the FETO's financial sources number 1 and 2 in Izmir, Küçükbay and Kavuk, regularly sent a loaded amount of money to Fetullah Gülen, the head of the FETO/PDY terrorist organization.
It was found that the money sent to Gülen was not deposited through banks, but sent by means of a courier from the organization.
On the other hand, nine people were arrested in Amasya, including Fatih Altınay, the President of the Merzifon Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who were detained in the framework of the investigation into the coup attempt by FETO, and released on the condition of judicial control.
30 thousand lira in 10 years
The call of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to "reduce interest" has moved the banks.
It was suggested that banks should be included in the campaign attack initiated by Imlak Konut and later joined by GYODER.
The proposal to reduce the housing loan interest rate to below 1 percent, which is considered a psychological limit, was also made by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
13 banks have cut their mortgage rates to below 1 percent.
It was the public banks that started the discount fury.
With the latest arrangement, the consumer who uses a 10-year mortgage will pay between 15 and 30 billion TL less interest based on monthly interest rates that previously varied between 1.12 and 1.29.
5 to 10 years
So how much will the interest rate cut benefit homebuyers?
A person who uses a ten-year loan of 100,000 lire will benefit from a 30,000 lira reduction in interest.
The vast majority of home loan borrowers choose a five- to 10-year repayment plan.
Interest rates are expected to fall further in the coming days.
The interest rate cut will also have a positive effect on sales.
In 2015, housing sales increased by 10.6 percent over the previous year, to 1.289 million.
This year, sales are expected to exceed 1.5 million at interest.
GYODER Chairman Aziz Torun: The annual rate should be lowered to below 9 percent
The public banks' move to interest rate cuts is a big step.
They've listened to our president's call and cut interest rates.
But it should be below 9 percent a year.
If this discount process continues, we're also considering extending our monthly 0.70 campaign for a few months.
The campaign could last three months
The banks joining in on this effort to revive the economy, which we've limited to one month, could be a factor in extending the historic campaign for at least another three to four months.
But the interest rate on the loan has to be below 9 percent on an annual basis.
It's gratifying to see that every sector is making sacrifices in the housing sector and in the real market, with the positive psychology and unprecedented solidarity that this will create.
Polat Holding YKB Adnan Polat: We expect full support from banks
It's a nice move for our president to go to the bank for a discount on his call.
Besides, there are some steps taken towards reviving the economy in all sectors.
The campaigns of NGOs, the decision of the Central Bank and all the steps taken in this direction...
All banks need to get their hands under the rock.
We invite them to come, join us in this movement, walk with us, walk in the same path, together, to revive the economy.
5.5 billion TL investment from Sabancı in 1.5 years
Sabancı Holding increased its net profit by 11 percent to 1.353 billion lire in the first six months of this year compared to the same period last year, and its sales increased by 22 percent to 17.166 billion lire.
Sabancı Holding CEO Zafer Kurtul said that they invested 1.8 billion TL in the first six months of the year, and about 5.5 billion liras since the beginning of 2015.
Kurtul said, "We have successfully passed a difficult turning point in recent times as a country".
"After this, it is time for our country to work and produce more", he said.
Two years' break from Kabataş to enjoy the boat
Due to the "Kabataş Square Repairs, Transfer Center and Iskalas Renewal Construction" carried out by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (İBB), Kabataş steamship docks were closed to sea traffic for about two years.
A modern transfer center will be built along the coast of Kabataş, integrating sea, rail and road transportation.
Traffic will be grounded, providing uninterrupted pedestrian flow along the coast.
The tram and funicular systems will continue to operate for some time.
Ring expeditions will be launched to ensure the transportation of citizens to Taksim, Eminönü, Beşiktaş areas.
Interest dropped, house increased
A friend of mine, the manager of a public bank, texted me.
It's always the same.
Interest is falling, house prices are rising.
Interest rates are going up, house prices are going down.
"Look, it's like this again".
He's talking about how he feels about his job, about personal loans.
He says that contractors who have entered the campaign of 0.70 percent organized by Emlak Konut have increased prices in many housing projects.
I checked to see if it was true.
There's a lack of condition, nothing more of the kind...
I remembered a conversation with a contractor who was attending a construction summit organized by our newspaper, a week after the coup attempt by the Fatah terrorist organization on July 15.
The boss of a big firm...
I heard the contractor, who I won't name, say, "We should actually raise prices by 10 percent", and I said, "Are you going to do a deal?"
After the coup attempt, the campaign led by Real Estate Housing launched a large sales campaign with a 0.70 percent and 120-month deadline.
I admit, he put his hand under the rock before the banks, took the risk.
But since we are moving in a spirit of unity and togetherness, we must not slow Turkey down.
Your one-month campaign was supported by the banks, who cut interest rates.
Then no one should take advantage of the extra opportunity.
And warn those among you who do.
President Erdogan accepted Omar Koc and Ali Koc
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan received the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Koc Holding, Ömer Mehmet Koc, and the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of Koc Holding and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ford Otosan, Ali Koc.
Erdogan's reception, which took place behind closed doors at the Presidential Palace, lasted 40 minutes.
Call from BDDK: Complain those banks
Mehmet Ali Akben, the head of the Banking Regulatory and Control Authority (BDDK), made a statement regarding President Erdoğan's warning to banks to "recall credit".
Akben said, "If banks turn the recall of loans into an opportunity because of market conditions and they do it with different measures, we will not allow it".
We tell those who bring such complaints and information to us, 'Call the BDDK complaint line by giving your name on the basis of the bank and company.'
President Tayyip Erdogan warned the banks in a statement yesterday: "I say that when interest rates fall, when credit opportunities are expanded, a new era will open up for our country, investors and banks".
I want to announce that in this period of our country, the banks that refuse to lend money, with false excuses, have set themselves a line.
And when interest rates were seven to eight percent a year, banks made money off of it.
More than 500 thousand Russian tourists are expected
Ali Kızıldağ, President of the Professional Hotel Managers Association (POYD), said that Turkey-Russia relations had entered a positive course before the July 15 coup attempt, that scheduled flights from Russia to Antalya had started and that there was a certain revival in tourism.
Expressing that the meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Russian President Vladimir Putin has excited the tourism sector as well as the sectors that trade between the two countries, he said, "I expect very positive developments in all sectors, from tourism to agriculture to food, from construction to textiles".
Turkey and Russia are two countries that are very close, we have traditional relations that have been going on for years.
"I think if we as sectors make very rapid progress on this path that the leaders of the two countries have opened, we can close the gaps and move towards the goals".
Explaining that they estimate that the number of Russian tourists coming to Turkey would exceed 1 million if there were no coup attempt, Kizildag continued:
But we lost a month in what we call the high season, so we're in for a little target reduction.
I still think we'll be over 500 thousand if the charter flights start.
And the season could extend to late October or even mid-November.
In that case, additional flights could be arranged for Christmas.
I expect this positive atmosphere will be appreciated by the Russian people.
They have a longing for Turkey.
I'm hoping at this rate, we can probably push 700,000.
Expressing hope for the Russian market in 2017, he said that if the relations between the two countries and the Russian economy recover, the number of Russian tourists could rise again to over 3 million next year.
The POYD President said that with the lifting of the ban on public personnel, domestic reservations have started gradually, "There are returns in cancelled reservations, new reservations have also started".
"We have a hopeful expectation about the Feast of Sacrifice".
He said that the lifting of the ban on the sale of tour tickets by Iran to travel agencies after the coup attempt was a very positive development, saying, "It would be very good if we could bring 100-200 thousand people from Iran in 1,2-2 months".
Are you new with an existing loan?
First, talk to your lender about how the new interest rate conditions affect your loan.
Calculate with your bank the cost of using a new loan at a lower interest rate, along with an early closing fee (usually 1.5-2 percent of the fee).
If you are still advantageous when all costs are included, you can apply for a low-interest loan.
No breathing for the lion!
The last champion Beşiktaş is aiming to enter the new season with morale by winning the Super Cup match against Galatasaray.
Technical Director Shenol Güneş, who based all his plans on winning, said in his interview with his students, "We have to play tempestuous and aggressive".
"I expect you to pass high and control the ball for 90 minutes".
It was learned that Shenol Güneş, who was not thinking of taking the players who missed the games, including Sosa, to the field, was indecisive about Adriano and Quaresma.
The experienced trainer tried Necip at the stop during the week's practice, but if Adriano plays at left-back, Tosic will be the stop.
Sun, who will also be a favorite between Ricardo Quaresma and Kerim Frei, also had his students do a standing ball exercise after a long break.
The Tolga is going to explode - Sports News
Galatasaray President Dursun Özbek answered the questions of the media at the dinner organized by the Galatasaray sponsor NEF the previous evening and supported the foreign footballer Tolga Ciğerci, whose transfer and annual salary were the subject of controversy.
I'm not the one who's gonna play football.
Dursun Özbek, who said that the football team is in a much better situation than last year, said: "It is not my place to talk about this, it is the players who should talk about it on the field".
I'll see the teams in a couple of weeks, then I can tell you our chance at the championship.
I'm expecting a blast from the Tolga.
You'll see Tolga in his pose, his physique, he's gonna blow up this year, everyone's gonna be watching with admiration.
Galatasaray President emphasized that they had contacted Mehmet Topal during the transfer period but would intervene if he did not agree with the club and said: "We did not intend to charge so that our rival would increase the price".
Mehmet is a gentleman, a great athlete.
If he didn't get along with the club, we'd like to transfer him to Galatasaray.
The bank bonds will be paid off
Uzbek said that they would soon start the construction of a hall next to the TT Arena, "We wanted to build a hall for 13 thousand people".
But our president said, 'Build a hall for 15,000 people.'
We changed the project.
We'll pay off the bank debt with the money from Riva.
♪ We're back to the roots ♪
Galatasaray President Dursun Özbek, who expressed his belief that the team that won the Turkish Cup last season will show its quality against Beşiktaş in the Super Cup final, which will be played tomorrow, made his claim with a phrase that is the slogan of the yellow-red club.
President Özbek said that Galatasaray will be champion again after a year's break.
The travel ban has been lifted.
The Club Association Foundation signed a historic resolution at its meeting yesterday.
At the meeting, which was the agenda of the 15 July coup attempt, a consensus was reached on the lifting of the travel ban.
From the new season, the fans of the guest team will be able to take their places in the stands in the matches between the four seniors and in the matches between Beşiktaş and Bursaspor.
Foundation President Göksel Gümüşdag said, "We decided to lift the travel bans in order to continue the unity and harmony that formed after July 15".
"We believe that this unity and equality is much more important after the 15 July Martyrs of Democracy", he said.
On the other hand, the results of the vote in the Clubs Union Foundation stated that the current board will continue in its duties.
Galatasaray Club President Dursun Özbek was elected chairman of the board.
Unlike previous meetings, the absence of club flames was noteworthy.
The table was decorated with Turkish flags to emphasize the unity and togetherness of Turkey.
"We will clean ourselves up"
The President of the Association of Clubs Göksel Gümüşdag, who stated that those who tried to attack the indivisible integrity of Turkey, found the great Turkish nation in front of them, "We do not have the luxury of taking the formation of FETO lightly".
"As a football family, we must also clean and tidy up our own garden", he said.
Gümüşdağ responded to a question in the form "Do you think an organization under the name of 15 July Democracy Cup?" "Especially the name of the Turkey Cup has a general opinion of friends".
He used the phrase "we'll share this offer with TFF".
Target is 25,000 combined .
Trabzonspor will compete in the new season in their new stadium.
The president of the boardmavilia, Muharrem Usta, determined the prices of the combined with his survey on social media.
The new season is expected to attract a lot of fans to the combines that will be sold by the Bordo-blue, who aim to sell 25 thousand combines and 100 thousand forms.
President, the target is 25,000 suits and more than 100,000 uniforms.
We've settled on the back of the fort and the east/west grandstand with the survey answers.
Good luck to you.
He used the phrase "you got the ball now".
The combined prices of the new season of the Bordeaux-blue club were determined as follows: "The combined prices of the upper-lower stands behind the castle are 350 TL, the upper-east and western stands are 750 TL".
The new season uniform of 150 lira will be given as a gift to those who buy the combination, students will receive 30 percent, and those who buy the combination with their spouse will receive 50 percent discount on the second combination.
South Korea 's official flag
Trabzonspor has reached an agreement with Hyun Jun Suk from South Korea on everything.
A one-year transfer fee of €750,000 will be paid for the player who is hired by Porto.
The player will also be given a guaranteed annual salary of 1 million euros.
The player's option to buy was set at 15 million euros.
The accountant was fired
F. Bahçe sent Pereira, who signed for two years on June 11, 2015, at the end of the first year.
President Aziz Yildirim and the board of directors held a meeting with the participation of the club's Financial Affairs Coordinator Tamer Yelkovan.
The economic dimension of the matter was put on the table at the meeting.
According to the agreement with UEFA, Yıldırım, which is sensitive to keep the "annual loss" at a level, received financial assistance from Yelkovan.
Pereira's representatives have been contacted.
It was announced that he would be terminated.
2-2.5 MILLON EURO for the following
It was stated that there are still some unresolved issues in financial matters, so the official announcement will be made today or tomorrow.
Pereira and his team went to the team practice yesterday, without any official announcement.
The total cost of this operation was about 4 million euros.
However, it was stated that F. Bahçe would provide a deal for the dismantling at a lower price.
If F. Bahçe pays Pereira's fee in advance, he will finish a figure of between 2 and 2.5 million euros.
If Pereira doesn't do this, he'll be paid monthly.
If he gets a deal with a team, that payment will be cut.
Yes, he finally went to Pereira and the Fenerbahce fan started a big revolution.
In the battle with Vitor Pereira, Caner Erkin, Luis Nani was martyred.
Robin van Persie was rescued with minor injuries.
I'm glad Vitor Pereira is gone, I think our administration will find it worse.
My joy is in my curve.
If Pereira is the champion, Fenerbahce is.
You can leave Vitor Pereira's suitcase at 3-5-2.
He went to Pereira, and then to Kadikoy on the 18th.
Serdar Chakir has been removed from office
It was learned that Serdar Çakır, a top-ranked referee observer in the Turkish Football Federation (TFF), has been removed from his post.
The appointment of Serdar Chakir, the father of our FIFA referee, Cuneyt Chakir, who is currently the referee at the Rio Olympics, caused controversy in the refereeing community last year...
In the TFF, the Central Arbitration Council (MHK), the Arbitration Council and the representatives and observers were re-created within the framework of FETO.
The smiling face icon from Van Persie
Just minutes after the allegation that Pereira was terminated was revealed, Dutch star Robin van Persie posted a fake on his Facebook account.
Robin van Persie, who shared photos of himself from the Fenerbahçe sport, followed the smiling icon with a football.
This post was interpreted as "happy that Pereira is gone".
The first independent gold in history was founded by Al-Deehani
Fehaid el-Deehani, who won first place in the double trap category in the 2016 Rio Olympics shooting event, brought the first gold medal to independent athletes in the history of the games.
Medals were distributed in the double trap category at the Olympic Shooting Center.
Al-Deehani, 49, who was competing with the Independent Olympic Athletes Team at the games due to sanctions imposed on his country, Kuwait, faced Italian Marco Innocenti in the final of the double trap category.

I opened a door for the headscarves
Doaa Elghobashy, an Egyptian who competed in women's beach volleyball at the 2016 Rio Olympics in a head covering, said, "I respect those who play in a bikini, and my competitors wear a head covering".
Elghobashy, who said he wanted to break the perception of Islam that has been established in the West in recent years, said, "I didn't have any problems with my shirt at the Olympics".
Here, athletes are struggling with their abilities.
I'm getting positive messages from many countries in the Islamic world through social media.
And women in particular, they say, "You're an inspiration to us, and we're proud of you".
I opened a door for women in headscarves".
Elghobashy, a 20-year-old Egyptian, said that foreign athletes sometimes came to him and asked why he wore a closed-fitting dress. "They understood when I told them that I went out in this outfit because of my religion", he said.

FETO chief Gülen's assets were seized
According to the Bureau of Investigation of Terrorism-Technical and Organized Crimes of the Adana Republic Prosecutor General's Office, 17 suspects were indicted in the Adana 2nd Heavy Penal Court in the indictment prepared for providing funding to the FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization by providing for the excessive increase in the value of immovable property belonging to persons and organizations connected to FETÖ/PDY, by making unfair changes in their construction plans.
In the case of accused number 1, Fetullah Gülen, who was tried for the crime of "Attempting to Overthrow the Constitutional Order", the jury issued an arrest warrant for the fugitives Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu.
But the court decided to conduct smuggling operations for the four fugitives who had not been caught and had not appeared for trial.
The 2nd Adana Criminal Court ordered the confiscation of all assets of Fethullah Gülen, Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who were in a foreign country and therefore were in a fugitive situation because they could not reach him, in order to ensure that the case against them would remain without result.
With this decision of the court, the immovable property, land-sea and air transport vehicles, all kinds of rights and debts, valuable documents, shares in the company where the partner is located, the rental fund assets and bank accounts of the fugitive defendants in Turkey were frozen.
Hüseyin Güler: Gülen's collapse is dependent on the collapse of 3 feet
Hussein Güleres, who commented on the coup attempt by FETO, made striking statements.
The following are the lines of Hüseyin Güleres's explanation:
As I thought about the coup attempt, I wrote about it in my articles for the last five or six months: "They can initiate but they cannot do it in the chain of command".
Two things I didn't know: first, that it was so widespread and deep, like the eight-year command of the General Command of the Gendarmerie and the President's favorite.
Mr. President, the most struggling person, whoever he may be, is careful about choosing his sweetheart, but the most important thing about them is their unprecedented secrecy.
They're very hypocritical.
One of the most important proofs of the statement, "This is not the work of a retired minister like FETO", is that it is such a deep compass.
He's got the CIA backing him up.
The CIA got their hands on this guy way too soon.
Mahmoud Övur says in 2014 that in 1971 they met with Fethullah Gülen at the house of Vehbi Koç.
He calls this period the closest the M.I.T. and CIA ever had to people who were most interested in this kind of work.
Our armed forces personnel were paid by the U.S., and after I forgot about it, one guy came out and said,
When we learn that, in 2014.
After Mahmut Bey's post, there was no explanation to deny it.
Like Fair Orphan, he got caught on the base, right?
They're wondering who this is.
Guy went to Pennsylvania twice in the 25 days before the coup, came back two days ago.
Justice Orphan has been out of the country 109 times since 2002.
When you put all this together, you have to investigate, all those who are currently fleeing, who have gone to the United States since March 1999, when Fethullah Gülen went to the United States, who went to the United States under any pretext, you have to investigate.
It would appear they've gone to Pennsylvania for some reason.
But his real connections to the CIA can be traced back to this, especially from the people who were supposed to be promoted from the security, and there were a lot of people who were sent to the United States safely.
It's in the WikiLeaks documents, and he's setting up a laughing group, and that's holding joint meetings with the CIA.
15 years ago, there were attempts to make those connections official with the CIA.
I told you Fuat Avenue was an intelligence pool in Pennsylvania two years ago.
The guy who works at the Prime Minister's office works for Fuat Avni.
But the bad news is, this information has fallen to the CIA just as it did to Pennsylvania.
Gulen's downfall depends on the collapse of three legs, one of which we call the base, which was a circle of friends, there are those who are deeply hypnotized, even say that this coup attempt is still a film of Erdogan.
I said three feet, a base support.
The stealing of questions, the theft, the violation of slavery, it's shaken that base of support.
The other two legs: political support, international support.
International support is still available.
The only thing that will break political support is the documentation that the tapes of the Baykal and MHP executives were taken by FETO.
After July 15, Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu is using "FETÖ", which opened everyone's eyes.
He's a laughing prankster who says, "I'm not doing it, I'm doing it".
He says, "Yes, Mr. Hussein, these girls are having very strange dreams, they're sending them to me, and I've banned them, because it's not right to act on dreams".
A voice recording was dropped, the person speaking in the audio recording is Barbaros Kocakurt: My friends have had a dream, our Prophet double the tweets.
One policeman was martyred in Nusaybin
According to the information received, the terrorists opened fire with long-barreled guns on the armored vehicle of the police who were on patrol in the Ayyub neighborhood of Selahaddin.
The first fire was a police officer was killed, a police officer was injured.
Two terrorists were neutralized in a clash that resulted in police responding.
The injured policeman was taken to Nusaybin State Hospital.
There's an operation in the area.
The strike was delayed. TV broadcasts were not interrupted.
Private television, which played an important role in preventing the coup attempt on the night of July 15, continued to broadcast thanks to a technical staff in TurkSat who heroically resisted the coup plotters.
That is the hero, Asim Akkaya...
Akkaya, who stated that they had entered the psychology of resistance with the order to cut the broadcast during the reading of the statement on TRT, said, "I risked everything thinking that my friends were martyred in the fire that was opened from the helicopter".
They wanted me to put a gun to my head and cut the broadcast.
I just turned off the local TV.
Then I got them to move away from the building by telling them we had to go to the dish antennas.
I spent about 20 minutes in the antenna section.
"I cut some cables here too, but I didn't touch the broadcasts".
When the coup failed to cut off the broadcast on TurkSat, they brought in the experts from the Star Trek TV.
These terrorists were caught by police officers who arrived at the scene three minutes ago.
When the strikers returned to the building, Akkaya, who realized that the TV broadcasts were continuing about an hour later, told them about his experience:
I took over the night shift at 8:00.
He entrusted it to us.
I had a friend who was a security guard for the e-government and the electrical system.
At about 9:00 p.m., while we were meeting for tea, helicopters flew overhead, flying low.
There were several other aircraft flying silently around the helicopter again.
We saw your light.
It was probably a drone that could take pictures.
They were flying in front of the helicopters.
I've been there 11 years, and it's the first time I've seen a flight so close, so I called the authorities.
Then a movement started.
We checked the news and found out the bridge was closed.
Meanwhile, our general manager instructed our colleagues in the security who were not on duty at the time to come to the building.
We went to the police station to get information and we found out that all the packages of his TV broadcasts were dropped.
TRT was cut off for five minutes.
I called the TRT main command but I couldn't reach it.
Our control station says the TRT broadcasts are back and the announcement is starting to read.
Deputy Director General Halil Yeşilçimen requested that TRT broadcasts be immediately cut off.
We've started working on the broadcast because TRT is broadcasting on channel 3.
We just heard Prime Minister Binali Yildirim say there is a conflict.
Our principal's order to "cut off TRT" has us into a bit of resistance psychology.
We cut off the TRT, and then we heard the helicopter.
We got out, the helicopter landed on the regiment, fired everywhere, everyone scattered.
We hid in a building in the back.
There were 12 of us.
When we got to the back, the soldiers got off the helicopter and went inside.
Some of our friends were captured by the soldiers.
We showed up to keep them together.
And I watched them take our assistant general manager and bring him to his knees.
The soldiers were talking among themselves.
One said, 'Let's shoot one of them, they'll freak out.'
Then they put us all in.
The commanders started shouting, 'I'm not going to ask who's in charge here anymore.'
We heard the "shoot somebody" type of talk, and we thought, "We don't know anything about the country, but we've got an order to cut off TRT".
So there's a resistance.
I felt like I was giving up my life.
I said, 'My'.
I got up, not knowing what to do.
All I could think about was that the helicopter was firing at my comrades in the regiment.
I thought about 10-15 of my friends in Nizami were martyrs and I was relieved to think that eventually they would kill us too.
The commander in chief said, 'You're going to cut all the broadcasts except TRT.'
We have a system section that monitors local channels as they go through the satellite.
We're broadcasting 80 of the 200 local channels from the room in question.
I thought of this room.
There was no national broadcast.
If I cut them off and say they're all cut off, at least by then, help will come from outside.
Or I said it goes where it goes.
We finally agreed that we couldn't get out.
I said, "Okay, I'll cut it off".
I've cut the antenna output of one of the local channel packets.
I've cut the power button to the monitors where we can watch the national channels.
So all the screens would say no signal.
I told him I had to go to the antennas to get it completely cut off.
The commander sent me to the antenna with two soldiers.
I opened the antenna room, one of the soldiers said, "Stop there".
He put a gun to my forehead.
He said, 'You're gonna cut them all off, except for the TRT, there's not gonna be one left, and I'm gonna shoot one of you eventually, and that's gonna be you.'
So I said, "You'll see when you go, it'll be frozen", and I said nothing else.
We went into the station, I was stalling local broadcasts.
We're on the other antenna.
I've got a system that's going to be on about 20 national channels.
We cut off the local channels, and about 20 monitors went down.
As my Lord has helped us, so that we were not unable to answer, and He has blinded their eyes.
They believed our answers.
They didn't.
That was a relief.
After we left the antenna, they asked where the transformer was.
I said, 'I don't know, I'm a TV broadcaster,' and he said, 'Is there an electrician here?'
I said, "No electrician after the evening shift, if there's a breakdown, the team will come".
Actually, there was an electrician at the time.
I remember I didn't cut the Cypriot broadcasts.
I was thinking of cutting them too, to distract the soldiers.
They were relieved to think that the publications had been cut off.
They couldn't think of looking at the broadcasts.
The group has now moved on.
About an hour later, they turned on the TV in the waiting room and saw A News.
He went in, soldier.
'My commander said 'A News did not interrupt.'
We've been in contact with the commander.
He said, 'Get up.'
I got up.
At that moment, a soldier said, 'There is still a continuing publication.'
'There are channels broadcasting in Cyprus,' he said.
I said, 'They're broadcasting over Cyprus, we can't do anything to them.'
"Then he got us all up and walked away after we'd written to someone".
The coup plotters fled TurkSat in a van.
I saw the photos of the soldier who took me to the bathroom and gave me water being executed in the seat of that van.
They shot him three times, in the forehead and cheeks.
My friends confirmed it was the same soldier.
They called that soldier "son" next to us.
Probably a veteran who served in the military.
They could have executed him to get rid of him.
According to Asim Akkaya's testimony, the first police team arrived in Turksat from Gölbaşı.
When police teams learned that helicopters were in the area, that security guards were scanning, they went back to the district to get ammunition.
They came back after 40 minutes.
When the police teams arrived, they didn't see anyone in the Turkestan foreign policy.
He said that the so-called experts sent by Samanyolu TV arrived in the building only 3-4 minutes after the police, "They told the police teams 'they called us from inside, we are Turkestan personnel, we need to enter urgently.'
"When the police asked for their identity, the four of them were in a hurry and they grabbed their phones and told the police that they were caught inside".
After the defeat, the spirit of Dagkapı
The AK Party will travel to Diyarbakır, Van and Mardin in early September with a large delegation of businessmen, artists, sportsmen and community leaders to build "heart bridges" with citizens in the region.
The AK Party is preparing to move the "Spirit of the Revolution" to Diyarbakır, which is made up of democratic sieges after the bloody coup attempt of the FETÖ/PDY.
The CHP and MHP provincial leaders will also be invited to the aid campaign that will be held in the Eastern and Southeastern regions of Anatolia before the Eid al-Fitr.
The AK Party, which will give the message to the people of the region "The state and the people are with you", will help poor families and those in need.
The AK Party's latest MYK meeting discussed the Gönül Köprü Project, which was first implemented in the month of Ramadan.
The meeting, which assessed the positive results of the project for families affected by terrorism, especially young people and children, decided to continue the Gönül Bridge on the Feast of the Sacrifice.
The work was started under the chairmanship of Deputy President, Head of Public Relations of Civil Society Mehmet Müezzinoğlu.
According to this, 12 provinces in the East and Southeast will be gathered in Diyarbakir, Mardin and Van.
There will be meetings in these three provinces, which are considered central.
Businessmen, artists, athletes and community leaders will also participate in the events.
At these meetings, the organization of the aid and the work will be discussed.
On the Feast of the Sacrifice, delegations of famous names will deliver the aid to the citizens in person.
The children and young people will be given holiday allowance, and the school needs will be met in this way as the schools will be opened after the holiday.
The meat will be distributed to those in need.
The national unity atmosphere against the coup between the AK Party, CHP and MHP after July 15 will be reflected in this project.
The 12 provincial leaders of the CHP and MHP will also be invited to the organizations.
The three parties will be able to carry out the relief activities together.
It is considered that the HDP will not be invited to the events, as in Yenikapı.
The father-in-law of Adil Otuküz spoke
The father-in-law of Adil Ötüz, who was shown as the first of the July 15 coup attempt, was detained along with his mother-in-law and sent to court.
The father-in-law, Cevat Yildirim, and his mother-in-law, Hatice Yildirim, were released on the condition that they be brought before the court under judicial control and with a ban on leaving the country.
Speaking at the courthouse, Cevat Yıldırım called on his son-in-law to surrender and said: "I am on the side of the state".
God damn the strikers.
I didn't really recognize the Fair Orphan I'd known for 18 years.
I don't have a son-in-law called Fair Orphan.
I want him caught as soon as possible.
He can't live in Turkey or in the world.
Let him come, trust in Turkish justice.
If he's wrong, he'll pay.
He's been running away from us.
Shame on the police, shame on the state.
For 20-25 days, the police have been doing nothing else.
Yıldırım said that he did not want Turkey to return to Syria, "We need to work, not a coup".
We don't want Turkey to go and be like Syria.
Syria had a neighbor like Turkey.
There is a president like Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
He said, "What's the use of us having a coup?"
On the other hand, the last time Ötüz was seen passing through the Akyazı shelves of the TEM Highway at around 03.00 on July 19, he was lost after leaving his vehicle with the 'SIR' plaque in the garage of his father-in-law's house in Akyazı.
FETO operation against the university: 30 detained
The button was pressed for the operation this morning in the context of the investigation into the establishment of the university in Izmir.

Among the names arrested in the operation carried out on the instructions of the Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic of Izmir are professors.
The names of the detainees were questioned at the Financial Crimes Branch.
The rest of the names are still being searched.
The arrested prosecutor attempted suicide
According to the information received, the teams of the District Police Directorate wanted to detain the Prosecutor of Viranshehir Ahmet Fişne in his office as part of the investigation.
Fişne then claimed that he would commit suicide by pointing his gun at his head.
Fişne was persuaded by his co-workers and his wife who came to the courthouse to stop committing suicide.
Fişne was taken to the District Police Headquarters.
Smoking ban in parks and sports grounds
Bilecik Mayor Selim Yagci said at the signing ceremony held at the Sheikh Edebali Culture and Congress Center, that they have added an article to the policy on not smoking in parks, sports and playgrounds.
He recalled that they had met with all public institutions to sign a protocol on the future of the new generations and wished that the protocol would be good for children and youth.
The provincial health director Yasin Yılmaz also said that the protocol is aimed at preventing people from smoking and removing young people from bad habits.
After the talks, Mayor Yağcı, the Rector of the Sheikh Edebali University, Prof. Dr. Ibrahim Taş, the Director of National Education Fazilet Durmus, the Director of Health of the Province Yılmaz, the Director of Public Health of the Province Ömer Balcı, the Deputy Secretary General of Public Hospitals Serkan Kadir Keskin and the Vice President of the Yeilayş Bilecik Association Branch Hilal Savran signed the protocol.
He saw the bull in Ergenekon, killed FETO
The Ankara Republic Prosecutor General's Office is investigating the role of FETO in the mysterious death of Behçet Oktay, the head of the Special Operations Unit, whose case was closed in 2009 for "suicide".
The main suspect in the investigation is former head of the Security Intelligence Department, Ramazan Akyürek, who was in the same room as Oktay and listened to Oktay under a false name as a suspect in the Hezbollah Terror Organization 6 days before his death.
It is suggested that some of the ammunition seized in the Ergenekon investigation was stolen and buried by the FETO team in the security from the Special Operations Department, which was also killed because Oktay detected it.
The death of Behçet Oktay, the head of the Special Operations Unit, who was found shot in the head in Ankara on February 25, 2009, was called "suicide".
But there were many question marks.
After two years of legal battles and evidence from his family and family lawyers, this time a murder investigation was opened.
Oktay, the left-hander, had the gun that he was said to have shot himself with in his right hand.
He also had fractures to his ribs and bruises on his body.
The case against him was opened in May 2012.
In the murder case, only Halil Kesic, who was with him when he died and found with a trace of gunpowder.
The jury finally acquitted him.
Nurhan Önder, who was in prison for another crime and sent a letter to the prosecutor saying that he was involved in the death of Oktay, was sentenced to 6 months in prison for "assuming the crime and misleading the judicial authorities".
The questions are asked
Meanwhile, prosecutor Hussein Yalçın, who called the incident "suicide", retired, while Mustafa Düzgün, who conducted the murder investigation, was promoted to the Supreme Court.
Oktay's family wants to investigate the autopsy prosecutor Nihat Yildirim along with these prosecutors.
Behçet Oktay's sister Shule Oktay and her brother Nezih Oktay and the family's lawyers made many demands during the trial.
The family said it was impossible for Halil Kesigi to kill Oktay alone, and asked for an extension of the investigation.
The family said that the incident was covered up, and demanded that prosecutors Hussein Yalçın and Mustafa Düzgün and the security officers who wanted to close the Behçet Oktay case as a suicide be identified and prosecuted.
While all the family's demands were rejected, it was revealed that Oktay had been arrested six days before his death under the false name "Abdurrahman Doğru" for being a member of the Hezbollah terrorist organization.
It was determined that the person who made the listening was the then head of the Security Intelligence Department, Ramazan Akyürek.
The Ankara Republic Prosecutor General's Office, which reviewed the Behçet Oktay case, began to examine the involvement of the Fetullahist Terror Organization (FETÖ) in the murder.
The case against Oktay's illegal recreation will begin on September 19 at the Ankara High Court.
Who's the FETU behind it?
The Oktay family, whom SABAH interviewed, are hopeful about the ongoing investigation.
Family members say that during the previous show investigation and trial, the FETO finger in the murder was covered up.
Sister Shule Oktay, "This murder was actually meant to be shown".
We didn't see it.
Before my brother was killed, he said, 'They're going to eat me.'
I said, "Who?"
That's when he pointed to FETÖ.
I thought he was gonna be discharged.
I never thought about dying.
Of course, FETO is behind this.
He said, "They had the government back then".
The martyr called the family of the young man, joined his prayer
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, after addressing citizens in the garden of the Presidency Hall, during the last watch of the previous evening, when the democracy patrols were interrupted, through the MP of the Sinop of the AK Party, Nazım Maviş, also called the family of the martyred university student Ömer Can Açıkgöz.
Father Fahrettin Açıkgöz said that the phone came at 01:30 at night when they were praying for their son.
"I told him that the health of his country and his own was important to us".
'YOUR health is important to us'
President Erdogan addressed the citizens in front of the Presidential Palace the previous evening.
Erdogan met with some citizens in Kulliy after his speech, which ended at midnight.
Taking the hand of an elderly aunt who came to the democracy watch, Tayyip Erdogan walked with the citizens, talked with them one by one, took care of the children, and thanked the citizens for their sacrifice.
Erdogan then called Fahrettin Açıkgöz, the father of the 15 July martyr Ömer Can Açıkgöz, through the AK Party Sinop MP Nazım Mavis.
The father of 21-year-old student of the Faculty of Law of TOBB University, Fahrettin Açıkgöz, who was shot in front of the Presidential Palace, said that President Erdoğan called at 01.30 at night while praying for his son and martyrs at home, "When I said we prayed for my son, our President also joined in his prayers".
I told him that the health of our country and his own was very important to us.
"We were very pleased that our President called and prayed on the phone", he said.
FETO's pyramid was destroyed
26 FETÖ members were arrested in Izmir Urla.
Among those arrested is Kurtuluş Naip Hepyalçın, who according to the victims' statements, was referred to as "mutagallibe" or a bully within the organization and threatened those who wanted to terminate their subscription to the Zaman newspaper.
In Ushak, 20 sisters of FETO charity were arrested.
In Bursa, 24 people were brought to justice, including former Bursa Police Director Ali Osman Kahya.
Doctor Imam has been arrested
In Edirne, the imam in charge of the organization's doctors, Aydın Tünbel, was arrested.
14 were detained at the University of Denizli Pamukkale, 30 were professors, 19 were detained at the University of Alanya Alaaddin Keykubat, 2 were detained at the University of Karabük, and FETO commander Hilmi Sandal was detained in Rize.
In Diyarbakir, 8 judges and prosecutors and 2 deputy governors, 2 sleepers were detained.
It was learned that one of the judges was detained in the courtroom.
In Batman, the deputy governor, the Shining Ages, has been exposed.
Two police chiefs were arrested out of 465 police officers who were revealed in Istanbul Police.
In Konya, 51 people were arrested, in Kayseri, 14 people, in Malatya, 14 people, in Siirt, 10 people, and in Adana, the imam of the province, Naim S. was arrested.
He's protecting the PKK who shot the people.
Turkey, which has been fighting relentlessly for over 40 years to end the terror of the PKK, has begun to show why it has not been able to destroy the leaders of the organization in this fight.
FETO militants infiltrated Turkey's critical institutions and worked to tie Turkey's hands from all sides.
At this point, there are serious doubts and evidence that FETO is behind such critical events as the Hrant Dink murder, the Uludere incident, the downing of the Russian plane.
The number of traitors is too large
It turned out that the record of FETÖ's Brigadier General Gökhan Şahin Sönmezateş, who led the raid and assassination of President Tayyip Erdoğan's hotel in Marmaris during the July 15 coup attempt, was very puffy.
It was previously determined that Sönmezateş had informed the terrorists of the air operations to be conducted against the PKK while the planes were flying.
Investigations by intelligence agencies also revealed that Gökhan Sönmezateş's record was puffy.
Protecting the terrorists
Besides the leakage of intelligence to the PKK, it was also revealed that Turkish warplanes did not hit the targets exactly.
The point intelligence given by the MIT in Kandil on the leadership of the terrorist organization PKK was allegedly misled by Gökhan Sönmezateş and prevented the target from being hit.
With the change of coordinates, it was determined that the fighter planes that flew to destroy the PKK's leadership were hitting the targets on the side of the targets, and the leaders of the terrorist organization were thus spared.
Intelligence analysis revealed that Sönmezateş played a key role in both the diversion of targets and the flight of PKK terrorists from the place where they were.
37 thousand officers are being opened.
After the FETO members' coup attempt was foiled by the terrorist leader Fetullah Gülen, the reorganization process was started in the TSK and the Ministry of National Defense.
Especially when it was realized that the entrance questions to military high schools were stolen by FETO, and that the non-member military students were being scared away and sent away from schools, a comprehensive cleanup process was started.
The last exports will leave about 37 thousand officers from 39,287 officers, while the cleanup for generals and admirals will be carried out for these officers.
Promotions will be frozen, especially for those in the ranks of lieutenant to colonel.
A full investigation will be completed before your promotion.
The files of 37,000 officers are being opened one by one.
A study of 40 soldiers will reveal the FETO.
Officers who are not affiliated with FETO will continue their duties.
The fight will continue until the last FETO is cleared from the army, while the promotion of officers will only come up after the investigation.
The investigation is being conducted jointly by the MIT, the Security Intelligence and the State Control Board.
The investigation is investigating whether the officers whose case was opened were civilians or graduates of the military school, their rank, promotion, place of duty and commanders.
And even through their systems, they'll be investigated by a study that will reveal whether they're FETO members.
Every measure will be taken to ensure that officers who have no connection with FETO are not adversely affected by the process.
If there is even the slightest suspicion, that officer will be immediately exposed and brought to justice.
Those identified as FETO affiliates, with information and documents about them, will be cut off from the military immediately.
While all these processes are frozen, the study will be deepened.
The necessary measures will be taken to avoid vacancies in the post-export staff.
Those who were expelled from the TSK by the FETO coup and forced to retire will be able to return to their professions after passing the security investigation in the same cadres and with the same exclusive rights as their colleagues.
2 , 133 soldiers deported
The General Staff announced the number of personnel of the TSK on July 1 as 39 thousand 287 officers.
The majority of the 32,289 personnel in the officer class consisting of lieutenants, lieutenants, captains, major, lieutenants and colonel were stationed in the Land, Air and Navy forces.
However, in the first wave of expulsions on July 27, 99 officers were dismissed, including 726 in the Army, 314 in the Air Force, and 59 in the Navy.
In the July 31 resolution, another 1,304 officers, including 125 from the Kara and 909 from the General Command of the Jandarma, were disconnected from the TSK.
Pehlivanoğlu: "Turkeys are poisoned by FETO"
The Chief Commissioner Tahsin Pehlivanoğlu, who retired from the protection of Alparslan Turkesh, the founder and first general president of MHP, suggested that Turkesh was killed by poisoning and that one of the family members did it in cooperation with FETO.
Pehlivanoğlu, who was with Turkesh every moment from 1977 until his death in 1997, said, "I never told anyone until today, but after watching the image of that soldier tearing parts from Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu's helicopter and seeing that the same soldier was among the coup plotters who were assigned to kill our President, I was forced to speak".
Here's what Turkesh's bodyguards have to say:
We went to Germany in 1997.
We had the head of the corn checked out three days before we arrived.
The 33-year-old doctor from Burdur, Fikret, who checked up, said, "You look like an 18-year-old".
He said, "You're fine".
This doctor somehow died a month later of a heart attack.
We returned to Ankara on April 3.
My headguard went to Amasia.
They called me on the way back and went to a meeting at the Ankara Hilton.
After the fight, the Turkish driver says to Alparslan, "Open the rear window".
He never opened a window.
When I open the window, I hear a "Huh".
First they did a cardiac massage, electro, at the Chankaya Medical Center, but it was over.
We took him to the medical center together, but it was too late.
I think someone in the family poisoned Amasya.
Turkeish was never autopsied.
His ex-wife Seval Turkesh must have heard about my discomfort and my statements, and he came out and made defensive statements like, "Turkesh was killed".
Man makes a grave, he makes a grave.
They called it a heart attack.
The tomb of Turkesh must be reopened.
Alparslan Turkesh was killed?
They were caught smuggling gold into Pennsylvania!
In the operation organized in Izmir to train FETO/PDY businessmen, 1.5 kg of gold was confiscated during its shipment to Pennsylvania.
The organized operation found 30 kilos more gold in the workplace, which was being held for smuggling to Pennsylvania.
Three people were arrested and sent to prison after gold was prepared to be sent to Pennsylvania, where businessman Mehmet Eldem worked.
In addition, the businessmen Mustafa Özkara, Ezel Seçilmiş and Rasul Seçilmiş were arrested in the course of the operation conducted in Izmir.
In the operation organized by the teams of the Directorate of the Department of Combating Financial Crimes of the İzmir Provincial Directorate of Security on July 29, the President of the Board of Directors of the Egean and Western Mediterranean Federation of Industry and Businessmen (ESIDEDEF) Mustafa Özkara and the owners of the Batınak Transit Transportation Petroleum and Tur. Tic. Ltd. (BALPET) Ezel Seçilmiş and Resul Seçilmiş were detained.
It was determined that the President of the FETO Özkara, who was captured at the Adnan Menderes Airport in Izmir while trying to flee to Kyrgyzstan, was the son of Osman Gurbuz Özkara, who was among the first delegation of Feto Gülen's first deputy, and was one of the most important names of FETO in the Aegean Region.
The five fuel stations owned by Ezel and Rasul Elekte, who were detained on the charge of providing financial resources to FETO, were also seized.
They stole cars in an hour and robbed three gas stations.
The incident happened last night in Eagle.
The two suspects, who arrived in the town of Eagle with their stolen vehicles, first robbed a petrol station on the side road, then another petrol station 300 meters away, and then another station on the side road.
After the robberies, the Eagle police, who had been alerted, identified the suspects and began the arrest.
Police teams tracked down the vehicle used by the suspects, C.S. and U.A.
The suspects started to flee from the vehicle they were using in the direction of the Eagle Square, at which time they also shot the police.
One of the suspects was caught in the act on the Boulevard of Independence after a pursuit that continued on foot.
Police quickly arrested the second suspect, based on information from the C.S.
The suspects were arrested and sent to prison after their proceedings in the Kartal Asayish Bureau.
On the other hand, the masked robbery was captured by security cameras.
The security cameras at the gas station show the suspect first entering the gas station, then re-entering the store, wearing masks and taking his weapons in the vehicle outside.
There's a struggle between the first suspect who enters the store and the store clerk.
After the suspect walks out of the store's attack, the other person with him enters with a mask and a gun to his head.
The suspect who drew his gun, after disabling the employees, escapes with the 6,200 lire in the safe.
During the search, the suspects seized about 15 thousand lira, an unlicensed weapon and a vehicle from three stations.
A 7.2 earthquake in the Great Ocean
The US Geological Survey (USGS) said the quake was recorded at a depth of 10 kilometers of the seabed, 109 kilometers east of the island of New Caledonia.
The tsunami warning issued after the earthquake, which caused no loss of life or property, was soon cancelled.
Vanuatu, located in the "Pacific Ring of Fire", is a frequent earthquake site.
He didn't know about the coup, but he prayed for the martyrdom.
The relatives of the 38-year-old Çetin Can, who was martyred on the Boğaziçi Bridge on the night of July 15, are protecting their metanets.
His wife Fatma Can said that she learned about the "Shuja prayer" in a conversation that night, while she was still unaware of the coup attempt, and that she prayed the prayer at home, advising her to do the same.
Fatma Can, who reported that they watched the news on television after the evening prayer and learned about the coup attempt, said:
We got ready and went out together.
When we got to the bridge, there were people waiting.
As soon as we got on the bridge, the tank fired twice at us.
We got a bulkhead, then we kept walking when the tank went.
There was a big bus stop on the bridge.
It was crowded.
We stood there for a while, waiting.
When we couldn't move forward, we thought what to do.
He wanted us to cross the sidewalk.
I'm guessing sniper, we were a clear target, and he was shot there.
Four hours after he prayed that hard prayer, he prayed that prayer and he was martyred.
He didn't know about the coup.
The wisdom of God...
God is the giver and the taker.
My wife said before, "If I die, plant a fruit tree for my grave".
I granted that wish by planting an apple tree over his grave.
Fatma said that they are grateful to President Erdoğan for visiting them, saying, "May Allah be pleased with him".

It was stated that after 34 days of disappearance in Istanbul, the return to Turkey of the German hairdresser Rita Darı Winkler (39) 's boyfriend, who was arrested in Germany four months later, could take four months.
Winkler arrived in Turkey on Thursday, March 3 to meet with her boyfriend Ali Kemal S. (46).
After meeting Ali Kemal S. in Istanbul Pendik, he was reported missing on Wednesday morning, March 9, while he was expected to return to Germany.
Following investigations by the Istanbul Police Department into the disappearance of her family, suspicions were focused on Winkler's married boyfriend Ali Kemal S.
On April 13, the program "Muge Anlı ile Tatlı Sert" was broadcast on Atv screens, and it was reported that Ali Kemal S. had made a search at the workplace belonging to his brother Hussein S. in Gölcük.

The German prosecutor general said that they could not determine where the suspect had been hiding so far, and that the process of extradition to Turkey could take 4 months.
It turned out that FETO coup plotters fired at the mosque on the night of July 15 to silence the chanting of the prayer from the mosque near the Akıncı Base.
SABAH received images of the attack on the TAI TUSAŞ mosque, the closest mosque to Akıncı Base, and the statement made by the imam of the mosque during his complaint "in the name of the saints".
According to reports, the gunmen opened fire at the mosque shortly after the chanting began, targeting loudspeakers directly from about 50 meters away.
One of the bullets hit the speaker's rim, four to the head.
When the punches failed to hit the speaker, the central system read the entire hall.
According to the crime scene records, the strikers broke into the mosque with the intention of killing the imam and walked around with postcards.
The mosque imam Mustafa Sheker said: "I am not injured, I have no personal complaints, but I want those who shot at the mosque and martyred the people of Kazan to be punished in the most severe way".

Measures against FETO in Macedonia
The Macedonian Minister of State, Furkan Čako, stated that steps were taken to uncover the legal extent of FETO's extensions in the country and to launch the necessary investigations.
Minister Chako recalled that the organization also has activities in the media and business world in Macedonia, "All this is public knowledge".
The Turks here no longer send their children to FETO schools.
We appeal to our people not to send their children here anymore.
"This building, which used to benefit from the hospitality and generosity of the people, is well known by the public", he said.
The sky will be the scene of meteor showers
TUBITAK National Observatory researcher and Istanbul University Department of Astronomy and Space Sciences faculty member, Doct. Dr. Hasan Esenoğlu, in his statement to the AA reporter, said that Perseid will reach its highest level on the night of Friday, August 12th to Saturday, August 13th.
Esenoğlu said that the Perseid meteor shower was formed by the impact of thousands of pieces of sunlight and gravity from the comet "Swift - tuttle", and that this situation will become a natural visual festival.
Esenoğlu said that the Perseid meteorite was first discovered in 1862, and since the 1990s, it has been seen again in the world.
He said that the Perseid rain can be observed in July and August, "We should be interested in watching such a visual festival from space".
It's a natural visual feast after all.
"It will help us to understand the universe better", he said.
They'll shine red when it's cold, white when it's hot.
Esenoğlu noted that some of the pieces of the stone falling during the rain will fall to the ground in the size of a pearl, and continued:
Perseid temperatures can reach up to 2,000 degrees.
Because of the warming and friction in the atmosphere, Perseids produce red light when they are cold and white light when they are hot.
The International Galactic Organization's website can help to contribute to science by listing how many meteors have been seen.
This data is valuable because it's collected from all over the world.
You can watch it all night.
Recalling that the rain of stones is moving at a speed of about 60 kilometers per second, Esenoğlu said that this visual festival in the sky can be observed well throughout the night from places with low light in the northeast direction.
Reporting that more than 100 meteor showers occurred in a year, Esenoğlu noted that after the Perseid meteor shower, the Geminid meteor shower on December 4-17 was a natural phenomenon worth watching.
Less educated, former football player Erdoğan
What upset this balance was the winning alliance between the populist Islamists led by the undereducated former football player Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the highly educated followers of the largely religious entrepreneur Fethullah Gülen, who built more than a thousand schools, dozens of universities and educational institutes from Texas to Tashkent.
The above is a translation of a sentence from an article in Foreign Policy last week.
These and similar articles, in which Erdoğan, a university graduate, is described as a low-skilled former football player, and Gülen, a primary school graduate, as a broad-minded entrepreneur, and Gülen's followers are openly praised, are frequently published in the Western press.
Then, on the other hand, they try to explain in their articles on the topic "Why is the opposition to America and/or the West increasing in Turkey?" with sentences that begin with "Because Erdogan"...
Analysts who see the Western opposition in Turkey as a new phenomenon that emerged during the time of Erdogan can be thought to be ignorant of Turkey's history.
In fact, if you look at the statistics, the first decade of Erdogan's rule can be read as a period when Western opposition in Turkey has decreased or remained average.
Because during that decade, we had good relations with the European Union and the United States in synchrony.
The 'one-minute' criticism of Israel by Erdogan, the failure of the EU to formulate a clear policy on the outbreak of civil war following the massacres of the Assad regime in Syria and the abandonment of Turkey in the refugee crisis, the overriding statements of some figures such as the President of the European Parliament Schulz, who said, "Erdogan is not our conversation", the opening of a blasphemy contest against Erdogan in Britain and the support of the then Mayor of London, the current Foreign Minister, the winning of a special poem with outrageous statements that you cannot imagine, the fact that the PKK, which has entered the country from Syria, is killing our citizens by the number of live bombs, the fact that the PKK's SPGPG is only responsible for the exhibition of the PKK in Europe and the reduction of the number of troops in the US military and military forces in the fight against the YPG, and the fact that the US is responsible for all the attacks on Turkey, including the visit of the YPG to the United Arab Emirates, and the fact that the Turkish military is not even allowed to participate in the fight against the YPG.
Let's say that we lost 247 people in a bloody coup, but we forgot that the so-called allies, the EU and the US, did not support our democracy until the coup failed, that they expected the establishment of peace and stability in Turkey in Kerry's first speech, and that they did not do anything to democracy and the elected government.
How can we forget that many leaders from around the world, including Turkey, have joined the protest march for the killing of 11 Charlie Hebdo employees in Paris, but that a month after the coup attempt, 247 people who resisted the tanks for democracy were killed, and no president from any Western country that is an 'allied' to Turkey has come?
What about the president who comes in a few times a year to deal with the refugee issue, or the ones who send top representatives, sends down-level representatives?
How can we judge that because the window of the newspaper Hürriyet was broken, all the EU and US ambassadors did not go to the past and make a solidarity visit to the bombed Turkish Grand National Assembly?
If we remember that during the coup in Egypt, the EU sent a high-level representative to shake hands with the coup leader Sisi in the first two weeks, and Kerry praised the coup government during his post-coup visit by saying that "democracy is being rebuilt", is it not very abnormal that Western countries who refuse to support Turkey in its resistance to democracy, express their concern for Turkish democracy at every opportunity?
But the fact that Gulen, whom 95% of the population considers responsible for the coup, is allowed to live freely in the United States is enough to anger the Turkish people.
And if you add to that the background I've listed above, I think it's clear that the rising Western/American antagonism is not something that can be explained by Erdogan alone.
Besides, Erdogan hasn't even said that he still thinks there's US influence in the coup...
So the box was never a transubstantiation.
Can the Gezi intellectuals who insult their own people, who say "the Sandik is a tavern", who insult voters who don't think like them as "ignorant people who scratch their bellies", play the same string after the night of July 15?
After seeing how these people have embraced the state and democracy, have they looked for the answer to the question, "Where did we go wrong?"
But there are so many questions to be answered?
How officers who served in various ranks and were given the right to use state weapons suddenly accepted the status of "Treason" and sought asylum from foreign states.
We need to see what a warped world we live in and how personality traits can lead people to conduct that could be described as deviant.
As for the brainwashed coup attempt...
Did those who took part in this action have a view beyond comparing Turkish cities to Syrian cities?
Why would an officer bomb his own country's parliament?
I don't think we should be under the illusion of expecting reasonable behavior from minds watered with the fetus's filth.
But let's be clear, FETO is not solely responsible for everything.
Those who have turned politics into a profession of strife, hatred and hatred have also contributed to the tragedies that have taken place.
The self-styled "Enlightened" have convinced the masses that all kinds of disorderly behavior and even impolite behavior are natural.
We've even seen how when those who hate their own people are given guns, they open fire on this people.
The way of democracy, the way we know
I'm saying something very simple: on the evening of July 15 in Turkey, the people gave 250 martyrs to the Tufeylis, the Haram, the Sergerides, the FETÖ in the army, and they did more than save democracy.
But there are three periods behind July 15th: 1992-2002; 2002-2012; 2012 and beyond.
There are three changes that have been prepared in these three periods: economic, social, political.
Social change has produced two major phenomena: migration from rural areas to metropolitan areas, and the movement of these migrants to the central areas after being confined to the periphery of cities for a very long time.
On Wednesday, I indicated that this move was by subway.
I also stressed that whether or not the subway is the most important element of social change.
The second big change in the same direction is bridges and roads.
The contribution of roads and bridges to modernisation is more easily understood.
The road is changing, the economic and social structure is changing.
And we've had a lot of political change.
I've been tracing this history back to the Istanbul Bridge over the Channel.
Demirel built the Bridge of the Strait.
This was the peak of the post-1950 peasant movement in the 1960s.
Ozal continued in the same direction with the second bridge, which we now rename the 15 July Martyrs Bridge.
Even their paths show the relationship between the environment and the center.
It's a sign of what kind of social change is going on.
Demirel and Ozal's goal was to melt the large masses in the center.
It was to introduce them to the ideology of the Centre.
The AK Party hasn't built a third bridge in years.
Because the migration was going at full speed.
The people who came were placed in satellite cities.
A somewhat closed system has been established in those areas.
Local governments with the AK Party gave people food, jobs, social status, and they voted for the AK Party.
So the masses were asked not to melt in the center, but to acquire their political consciousness in the surroundings and to come to the center afterwards 'as themselves'.
This formation was related to the ongoing headscarf debates (1992-2002) before the AK Party.
These debates convinced the masses that the conservative, the sectarian and the rural people must stand side by side, not in integration with the center.
The AK Party, acting in the manner I described after 2002, politicized the masses, brought them into politics, made them mature.
After all, now notice, the construction of the Third Bridge coincides with the democratic struggle of July 15.
So, history and sociology overlap.
Let me add another dimension: the AK Party's move, which I'm talking about, is not limited to Istanbul bridges.
And something more interesting is happening: the AK Party is now integrating the suburbs with the central cities.
And this is done through two bridges.
One is the Osmangazi Bridge.
Two, the Çanakkale 1915 bridge.
Add the paths to it.
Turkey will now reach Izmir from Thrace by another route.
You know what that means, Izmir will be a different city from now on.
Let's say that the AK Party won't take Izmir from the inside, but will take it from the outside.
Now Bursa, now Çanakkale, now the cities of Thrace will become other human and social geographies.
That's it!
The 15th of July martyrs are the stars of this great adventure.
Van Persie and cheerful sports in Fenerbahçe
Fenerbahçe continued preparations for the Grasshoppers match with a practice session in the morning.

After 30 minutes of core training in the gym, the players took to the field and ran and warmed up, and did 2 for 5 catching and passing.
The training was completed with a double goal against the home side.
Fenerbahce will continue his preparations with a training session this evening.
The person who complained to Gülen about St. Yildirim...
There are new developments in the operation against Fenerbahçe.
Journalist Hüseyin Gülerek, who participated in a program broadcast on CNN Turk and explained that this operation was carried out by FETO, said: "A name from the sports world has raised Fethullah Gülen's words about Aziz Yıldırım himself".
"One day on the plane, Yıldırım said, 'What are you doing with Fethullah Gülen?'
When this person passed these words to Gülen, Fethullah Gülen also put them to Aziz Yıldırım.
Why is he into St. Thunder?
The president of the club with the most fans in Turkey is in this mindset, thinking he might hurt himself.
He used the phrase "The chic case was to liquidate Aziz Yıldırım".
After these words, a statement came from Faik Işık, one of the important lawyers of the Shike Case.
Işık appeared on the program "Contrary View" in Haberturk and explained who had complained to FETÖ chief Fethullah Gülen about Aziz Yıldırım.
Here are the words of Faik Işık:
Aziz Yildirim is telling Ihsan Kalkavan something about Fethullah Gülen.
He's on a private plane from Azerbaijan.
The saint is a man of humor, and when he criticizes someone he makes a deep sentence.
Those subtle sentences might be a little bit winky.
Some may react to those sentences.
These sentences are being grown.
The Havaliers, the charity, the businessmen, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the
They're very critical of what they do.
That's not the only problem, of course.
They're also trying out for a football team.
Direct contacts of some players and managers from Galatasaray Club and Hakan Shukur...
Muharrem Master: The subject of fashion is different
The President of Trabzonspor, Muharrem Usta, extended his friendship to Fenerbahçe.
He said that the Turkish problem is the problem of all clubs, "We are on the side of this country with 79 million".
We must show a sound mind.
If Fenerbahçe has a problem with FETO, if injustice has been done, I will stand behind Fenerbahçe.
"But the issue of style between Trabzonspor and Fenerbahçe is different", he said.
The price of the sacrifice was announced
Karabulut said: "As a group, we have set the price of a kilogram of live sacrificial bull at 18 lira".
"We have determined the price of the camel, again, 17 lira per kilogram of live, and 15 lira per kilogram of live cow, which we call second class", he said.
Noting that animals that were not going to be sacrificed last year were also put up for sale, Karabulut told what citizens should be careful about when making sacrifices:
In animals, the ear can be particularly sensitive.
It's also important that the animal is healthy.
So that our citizens can check the vaccines on the animal's passport while they're making sacrifices.
And by appearance, the victim must be alive and well, and she must have shed her hair.
And you should have no saliva or sputum on your face.
In recent years, we've seen non-victim animals being offered for sale and sold.
A victim must be two years old.
We can tell by looking at the animal's teeth.
A two-year-old animal has what we call "claw" teeth.
But younger animals don't have those teeth.
The animal may look large, but the tusks may not have come out.
The fangs are already noticeable, because they're bigger than the others.
Rize Airport will be built on the sea
The second airport to be built in Turkey with sea traffic will be Rize Airport.
Rize Airport will be built on 266 hectares of land between Yeşilköy village and the location of Kız Kulesi, Sunday district, 26 to 32 meters from the coast.
Due to the high depth of construction of Rize airport, about 3 times more filling material will be used than that used at the Ardu-Giresun Airport.
The project will include a 45-meter-wide and 3,000-meter-long runway with a ramp capable of landing and taking off 36 aircraft per hour.
The airport will also serve aircraft of composition class D, turbulence class heavy, take-off weight more than 150 thousand kilograms.
The project of Rize Airport, which will be tendered by the General Directorate of Infrastructure Investments of the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications on September 8, will include sea fill, piston, taxiway, surrounding road, safety wire mesh, mendirek, PAT fields and environmental lighting.
These works will cost 600 million lire.
After the infrastructure works, the upper construction works will be done, including the terminal buildings, without spending 150 million lira.
The construction of Rize Airport will be completed in 2 years and 9 months.
Eight cents more for your engine.
The fuel distribution companies have raised the average of 8 cents per liter of the engine, effective midnight tonight.
According to information received from the Petroleum Products Employers' Union (PÜIS), from 13 August 2016 the price of the motor will increase by an average of 8 cents per liter.
Accordingly, the price of the motor in Ankara, which has an average of 3.68 liras per liter, will rise to 3.76 liras.
The price of the motor will rise from 3.63 liras to 3.71 liras in Istanbul, and from 3.66 liras to 3.74 liras in Izmir.
The prices set by the distribution companies can vary slightly by company and city because of competition and freedom.
The fuel companies last Friday raised the price of his engine by four cents a liter.
Here are the Galatasaray players in Gülen's chat
It turned out that Galatasaray and national football players, who once left their mark on Turkish football, were in a conversation with FETÖ chairman Fetullah Gülen in 1996.
The footage, which was allegedly taken in 1996, clearly shows that among the players who listened to Fetullah Gülen's conversation were Hakan Ünsal, Mert Korkmaz, Okan Buruk, Arif Erdem, İsmail Demiriz, Uğur Tütünker and Yusuf Tepekule.
In the conversation, Gülen used the phrase "4 goals we scored and won" referring to Galatasaray.
Said Alpsoy, who is also known as the former football imam of FETO, recently told SABAH newspaper that "Turkey was awarded the prize when it became the third world in 2002".
Emre, Okan, Hakan Shukur, Hakan Unsal and Arif collected money from these bonuses.
The money raised was $250,000 or $500,000.
Arif Erdem took this money to Pennsylvania.
"Gulen then praised Arif", he explained.
The national football players joined Gülen's conversation!

What a powerful statement about FETÖ from Robert Amsterdam!
Robert Amsterdam, an official at the law firm Amsterdam&Partners, which is investigating the international illegal activities of the Fetullahist Terrorist Organization (FETÖ), wrote an article for the US magazine Forbes, sharing information on how FETÖ is organized.
Amsterdam, which said FETO chief Fetullah Gülen runs the organization from his Pennsylvania mansion, said that "a close look at how Gülen runs about 150 charter schools in the United States will make it clear that the organization has a secretly advanced organizational capability underground".
Amsterdam said it was "shocking" to see what it had found so far, citing that Turkey had been tasked seven months ago with investigating companies and schools linked to Gülen.
In his article, Amsterdam expressed the following view:
According to the information we've been given by the informants, the Gülen organization has a strict hierarchy of instructions.
These instructions are usually given in face-to-face meetings at Gülen and the Poconos.
There's a seven-person management group on the hill.
This group is passing instructions to the advisory committee.
From here, instructions go to the regional imams, the country imams, the regional imams within the country, the provincial imams, the regional imams within the provinces, the neighborhood imams, the imams of the student houses (lighthouses) and the students.
Businessmen, bureaucrats and officers work at different levels depending on their positions and support within the organization.
Amsterdam, which claims to have created 55,000 jobs worldwide and has the largest network of charter schools in the United States, said that millions of dollars of American taxpayer dollars are given to these schools each year.
Amsterdam wrote that most of this money was channelled among the members of the organization and transferred to "selected" foreign companies.
Amsterdam explained this by the following examples:
Magnolia Schools, a California-based company, was caught paying $700,000 in annual service contracts to a company affiliated with Gülen that shares the same office.
Amsterdam also pointed to Dove Science Academy in Oklahoma as another example.
Amsterdam also reported that the school paid the owner an additional $3.1 million, and that the audit found that the school and the management of the company that owned the property were the same people connected to Gülen.
Amsterdam, which noted similar cases in the 46-branch Harmony schools, the largest in the Gülen network, said that smaller companies linked to FETO were paid money with pens, such as software licenses, curriculum purchases.
Amsterdam, underlining the enrichment of the FETÖ, said, "These examples I've given show that about $28 million of American taxpayers' money is being misused".
"And that's just the visible part of what we've found so far", he said.
Noting that nothing has been done to prevent such incidents, Amsterdam recalled that the situation has worsened in the recent period, and that the Texas Department of Education has begun investigating the irregularities.
Amsterdam stressed that the schools were operating seemingly normally, with many employees not having any information about what kind of corruption was involved.
Amsterdam, "But in fact these schools work like snow machines for the Laughing".
"Gulen then uses the huge amount of money for political donations to hide his illegal activities", he said.
According to a former American teacher who worked in these schools, some employees of Gülen schools held meetings separately and transferred a portion of their salaries to the organization.
The coup plotters had been consolidating their positions over the years.
"But while the military seemed to be operating normally, a parallel force was gathering strength behind the scenes", he wrote.
Amsterdam concluded his article:
The US policymakers have questions about the events of July 15-16 and beyond, and that's to be expected.
But while the two allies are dealing with the situation at the diplomatic level, the individual government officials need to wake up to the serial violations of US law in Gülen's operations.
22 judges are on the run in Istanbul!
It was learned that 22 of the 648 judges and prosecutors who were investigated by the Ankara Republic Prosecutor's Office on the grounds that they were members of the Fethullahist Terrorist Organization, who were revealed by the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) on August 10, 2016, have fled Istanbul.

Zachariah Oz from the Chief
On the question about the allegations that Zakariya Oz and Adil Ötüz were arrested in Georgia, Çavuşoğlu said: "At the moment this information is not true".
But there are different reports.
All of this is being evaluated.
We're in close contact with the Georgian authorities.
"Every detail, every information, every tip is being carefully evaluated", he said.
Asked if there was any doubt that they might be in Georgia, Çavuşoğlu said, "Zekeriya Öz had fled to Georgia before".
It was picked up on the security cameras at the customs gate.
He knows he's been to Europe.
We're looking at every piece of information that comes in, not just for these two, but for every other fugitive.
Wherever they run, we will follow their trail".
Asked about his meeting with his Iranian counterpart, Javad Zarif, Cavusoglu said, "Two issues were considered".
There are many issues between Turkey and Iran.
Politics, trade, transport, energy, the fight against terrorism is our common struggle.
There are regional issues.
The first is Syria, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, the Gulf.
Turkey and Iran can play an important role in solving the problems we are facing in our geography.
We agree on a lot of things.
We agree on many issues, including Syria's territorial integrity, the integrity of its borders, and the clearance of ISIS and other terrorist organizations in Syria, and the need for an inclusive government.
We had different opinions about Assad.
But we'll keep talking about this as we always have.
We agree on the ceasefire, the continuation of the Geneva negotiations.
Consensus on many things is meaningless unless it's basically inconclusive.
He said, "It's about getting results".
When asked when Turkish planes would participate in operations in Syria, Çavuşoğlu said, "Our delegation went to Moscow".
"The purpose of establishing these mechanisms is to determine what steps are taken in the fight against ISIS here, in particular, and to coordinate any incident so that no accident occurs", he said.
Asked about gas purchases with Iran, Cavusoglu said, "Iran and Turkey are two brotherly countries".
The arbitrators shouldn't decide, we can make a deal between us.
I had a little website.
We should be able to make these deals before we go to trial.
"We have had demands on gas reductions, prices", he said.
When asked about the date of Gulen's return to the United States, Çavuşoğlu said, "A delegation from the United States will come in 22".
Meetings will be held on August 23-24.
Our Justice Department is working on the file.
The file will be ready as soon as possible, coinciding with the next visit from the United States.

Mustafa O. said, "We were going to visit with friends".
We got our stuff.
We were hit by a car near the transformer of the village of Karadut where the Prophet came.
I broke my leg from the impact.
The driver took my friend first and threw him in the trunk.
And then he took me and put me in the trunk of the car with my friend.
My hand was stuck between the trunk doors when I put it in the trunk.
I screamed.
The driver who hears me will re-lock the trunk.
So I fixed my hand.
He closed the trunk door again and took us to the village of Narince.
"From there, they took us to Kahta State Hospital in ambulances", he said.

I went straight to Kahta State Hospital.
They brought my nephew first.
15 minutes later, they brought my grandson.
The Gerger Station Commander is here.
The mayor said you're the complainant.
I mean, accidents happen everywhere.
I said I'm not a complainer.
Then I went to look at the car that hit my nephew and my grandson.
There's a lot of blood in the trunk.
Then we found out that after he hit the kids, he's putting both of them in the trunk of the car and taking them to the hospital.
He's putting my nephew in the trunk, and my grandson in the trunk.
The guys say I didn't put it in the trunk.
But the backseats of the car are clean.
"That's not possible", he said.
Mehmet Kaya, a resident of Narince village, said: "The driver who hit the children brought the injured here".
They took the children, the injured, out of the trunk of the car.
"He did what should not have been done to an animal".
Osman O, the wounded man's uncle, said, "What kind of a citizen is this who shot these children?"
It could be an accident, a person could die in an accident.
But to take the wounded in the trunk of a car and take them to the hospital is a brutal thing.
We're followers of this business to the end.
One of these kids is clawing death.
The other one's in serious condition.
He's bringing the wounded in the trunk of the car from Narince to Kahta.
God damn it, you know.
Don't let anything like this happen again.
Our lungs are burning.
We're gonna sue and we're not gonna back down.

Richard's island is made of plastic air-filled bottles, wooden pallets and sand.
It's a two-story house with two bathrooms, a hot tub, three showers, a kitchen and wireless internet.
The island is surrounded by palm trees, mangroves, fruit trees, and other edible plants and herbs.
The island, which is connected to the coast by a 30-meter-long cable, generates its own electricity, water, and Internet.
Sowa: "I am a vegetarian and I grow many edible vegetables on the island".
I have to go to the nearest little shops to get some other food.
"I also have a 8-person cart made of plastic bottles", he said.

Hakan Shukur and his father's 200 million assets were confiscated
The Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic of Sakarya issued a detention order against Hakan Shukur and his father, Selmet Shukur, who was a contractor in Sakarya, as part of the FETO investigation.
The search was carried out at the homes of Hakan Shukur and his father, Selmet Shukur, in the United States, and Adapazar, in Istanbul.
Salmet Shukur was never found despite the searches.
Police responded to reports that Selmet Shukur was praying at the Salko Mosque on Adapazarı Sakarya Street.
The teams went to the mosque to wait for the Friday prayers.
After the prayer was over, when Selmet Shukur saw the police, he raised his hands.
Selmet Shukur was taken to the Police Directorate in a police vehicle.
Gökhan Shukur followed the team vehicle that took his father to the police headquarters.
The Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic of Sakarya determined that Hakan Shukur and his father, Selmet Shukur, provided financial support to FETO.
After examining the application of the prosecutor, the Nursing Justice of Peace decided to confiscate the real estate of Hakan Shukur and his father, Selmet Shukur, the vehicles of land transportation, the accounts in banks or other financial institutions, all the rights and receivables of real or legal persons, the valuable documents in the registry, the shares in companies, the rental boxes and other property values.
The court's decision was notified to the religious directorates, the security directorate and the tax department within the day.
Hakan Shukur and his father, Selmet Shukur, were found to be wealthy in the first place.
It was found that Hakan Shukur and his father had apartments in Sakarya, Antalya, Bodrum, Istanbul Bakırköy, Beşiktaş, Büyükçekmece, buildings in Adapazarı and Sapanca, and plots in Kandyra.
It was determined that Selmet Shukur built luxury villas on 10 acres of land in Sakarya's Serdivan district.
It was also determined that Hakan Shukyr had a classroom in the center of Adapazarı, which was closed by the FETÖ investigation by tax inspectors attached to the Sakarya Group Presidency of the Tax Control Board of the Ministry of Finance.
Hakan and his father, Selmet Shukur, are said to be worth around 200 million lira.
The fugitive police chief was caught in Zaho.
The 3rd class of the Batman Provincial Police Directorate, Ahmet Duran Bitmez, was released in the framework of the investigation into the coup attempt of FETÖ.
It was determined that Bitmez, who was also arrested, had escaped.
The investigation by the provincial police department revealed that Bitmez had fled to Zaho, Iraq.
He was caught in a joint operation by the security forces of both countries.
Bitmez, who was brought to Turkey, was detained in Batman.
As soon as he's done, he's been transferred to the courthouse after his security clearance.
Security forces suspect Bitmez has fled north of Iraq to join the camps of the terrorist organization PKK.
Watch out for this habit of the children .
Dr. Bilgin Giray, dean of the Faculty of Dentistry, said that children relax with this reflex by making sucking a necessity because they cannot chew at an early age.
"Finger sucking is a phenomenon that occurs from birth to the age of three to four", said Doç, who lists the causes of the habit of sucking fingers in children.
Most babies suck their thumbs.
The baby sucks his thumb to satisfy his need for sucking, and after 1 to 1 1/2 years sucks his thumb to satisfy his longing for his mother's breast and relax.
"Distraction can be a sucking act when bored, when sleepy, when nervous, and when separated from mother".
Dr. Bilgin Giray emphasized that the reason for the finger sucking behavior in older people is the lack of maternal-child relationship and the lack of confidence in the child.
The sucking behavior of the fingers has a negative effect on the formation of the child's teeth.
The pressure of the emptying process pushes the upper teeth forward, while the lower teeth are pushed back.
This causes the lower jaw to rearward, disrupting the balance of the jaw and the tooth structure.
The physiological reflection of this is speech disorders and the aesthetic disadvantage of closure.
Dr. Giray noted that if no early solution is found, a much more complex treatment process can occur at the age of six to seven, when permanent teeth begin to emerge.
"So, today, the mouth needs to be controlled, just like the eyes and ears of children", he concluded.
New breath in near vision: Trifokal Lenses
After cataract treatment, patients naturally don't want to wear glasses.
For many years, highly focused lenses have been used to solve this problem in our patients.
The recent introduction of trifocal lenses has taken the success of treatment in this area a step further.
The difference between trifocals and other lenses is that they can provide clear vision not only at distances far or near but also at distances defined as intermediate distances.
Treatment of distant, near or intermediate vision impairments
The interstitial distance in visual impairment represents a point that we use so often in our daily lives.
For example, the dashboard of a car, the portable computer we hold in our arms, or the distance we define as an arm span of 60-70 cm.
And because trifocal lenses can adjust the spacing, our patients don't need to wear glasses at all, regardless of whether they're near or far.
Another advantage of trifocals is that they reduce nighttime complaints.
Eye Disease Specialist Doct. Dr. Volkan Hürmeriç "There is no difference between the trifocal lens treatment for all-distance vision treatment and the normal cataract treatment".
Our patients who receive trifocal therapy can easily regain their sight in a procedure that takes seven to 10 minutes.
And the next day, our patients can go back to their normal lives.
It's an operation that improves the quality of life, especially for people who drive cars, use computers a lot, like to read, and lead more active lives.
You may also want to consult an eye doctor to find out whether this procedure, which is available to any patient over the age of 18, is appropriate for you.
The blood vessels are not used in heart surgery!
Varicose veins are a disease that's been on the rise in recent years.
Inheritance, where genetic affinity is a priority factor, leads to an increase in inheritance complaints due to long working hours, long standing tasks, and long sitting.
Are veins used in heart surgery?
I have an heir, and people often ask, what if I have a heart attack in the future?
Here are the answers to those questions.
There are two types of collective blood vessels in the leg:
The first is the deep collecting system, which is the main route that takes dirty blood to the lungs and collects the main dirty blood from the leg.
These are called deep femoral veins and superficial femoral veins.
Problems with these vessels are less common, and they can't be closed, and they have to take medication to keep them open.
There's a superficial coronary artery system in the leg that carries dirty blood to the lungs and joins the deep carotid artery system in the pelvis, which we call the lateral artery.
This system is made up of two large and two small saphenous veins.
All four of these veins can develop deficiencies and hereditary disorders.
The coronary arteries that can be used in heart surgery are superficial coronary arteries called the great saphenous veins.
The absence of these vessels is harmless to the body, and therefore can be used in heart surgery.
But for these vessels to be used in heart surgery, they have to be healthy.
Because the heart is a very important organ.
The procedure of surgically removing the veins or laser burning them in place also reduces the workload on the deep veins and makes the leg healthier.
A common misconception is that blood vessels can be used as a replacement, even if they are inherited.
A blood vessel is never, ever used in heart surgery!
There are other veins that can be used in heart surgery.
The backup vascular systems that can be used in heart surgery are located under the chest, around the abdomen, and in the arm.
So it's unreasonable to wait and worry about using the blood vessel for the heart.

Uzbekistan's meaningful message ahead of the Super Cup
Galatasaray Sports Club President Dursun Özbek issued a statement ahead of the Super Cup Final between Galatasaray and Beşiktaş.
Here are the words of Dursun Özbek, who drew attention to the unity and togetherness in Turkish football:
Galatasaray and Beşiktaş, two of the most popular clubs in Turkish sports, will face off for the Super Cup on Saturday evening at the Torku Arena in Konya.
This is neither the first nor the last match in a rivalry that has left our two great clubs a century behind.
But it's a very vital encounter in terms of timing.
As we all know, our country suffered a great tragedy on the night of July 15th.
The coup attempt of the Fetullahist Terrorist Organization/Parallel State Building (FETÖ/PDY) that threatened our democracy was overcome thanks to the unity and solidarity of all sections of society.
We paid a heavy price as a nation that night.
We gave the martyrs.
We have a lot of gas.
This bitter price has reminded us once again of the virtue of democracy, the need and importance of peace, not conflict, in these lands.
That night, the representatives of Turkish sports stood together against the coup, all on the side of democracy.
In these critical times, we need the unifying quality of sport more than ever.
I wish that this match, which coincides with the 2nd anniversary of the death of our dear rival, President Süleyman Seba, and just before the new football season named after the legendary captain of our club, Turgay Sheren, will be the first match of love and peace in Turkish sports.
I hope that whatever the score at the end of the match, which will be played in front of the stands where Galatasaray and Beşiktaş fans will share half-half, the winner will be our country and Turkish sport.

Scot Callum Skinner flies home as Britain snatches gold
The British team's trio are defending their title from London 2012 while Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to victory in the men's race at the Rio Racecourse last night.
The 23-year-old Glasgow racer took on the pioneering mission of Scottish Sir Chris Hoy, who proudly brought home the legend in his acclaimed New Zealand suit.
Four years earlier, when Hoy won five of his six Olympic golds, Britain had taken a shocking victory.
And they repeated that feat by finishing sixth at the World Championship of Racing in London in March, even though Hoy had retired.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of expert starter Jamie Staff.
They did it right when Hindes showed up.
Hoy's retirement also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
They had seen the potential that Scott had already realized, and the British coaches had not given up on Skinner.
Although Hindes, Kenny and Skinner, who had won the title with Hoy four years earlier, had broken the Olympic record in the qualifying round, New Zealand set the record again in the first round.
And the British trio went to the gold duel.
Although Hindes was a bit behind on his own lap, Kenny put the team ahead and Skinner took it.
It was this change in strategy that was a big part of the transformation that allowed Hindes to keep pace with Kenny and especially Skinner, using a larger tool to slow himself down.
Hoy, as the BBC's expert commentator, watched them from the sidelines and was caught by Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they took the podium.
"That is an honorable comparison", said Skinner, 23, of Glasgow.
I'm just here to do my best and make my name known.
We broke the Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
That was really incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
Hindes admitted to deliberately falling on the track after a poor start after winning the London 2012 with Kenny and Hoy.
He later reacted to this comment, and there was no way for Britain to compete with its rivals.
This time, there was no such problem for an incredible victory.
Hindes said: "We felt like we were in London with all the British flags on the stand".
We're a team that was formed only three months ago.
We've lost so many world championships, so to win again at the Olympics is a really amazing feeling.
It's just one event, one medal for a nation that won seven of the 10 events in both Beijing and London.
If that's a measure of the progress we've made over the last five months, we've got five more days of success on the racetrack.
Kenny's attitude shows that Hoy's dream of repeating the record of winning three golds in one Olympics is not too far off.
This would mean that Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and was born on 23 March (also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister, a sacred date in British sports history), would have achieved six gold medals and one silver medal.
That's the same level as Hoy.
Kenny is going to the sprint race, which starts today and lasts three days.
"I'm just enjoying it for now", said the 28-year-old from Bolton.
Team events are always the best.
You can win with your friends.
Honestly, it's lonely when you win alone.
Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted".
Although this is just today's medal ceremony, there is much good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull finished first in the four-man, four-kilometer team race.
They finished the course in 3:51.943.
The world record set by the 2012 London gold medalist is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final will be decided in today's second half, and Wiggins will surely be the focus of all the attention.
Yesterday, before the qualifying round, he had a run-in with officials when he was called in to take his height.
The women's event, which continues and concludes tomorrow, saw Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie set a world record with a time of 4:13.260.
Team Great Britain is relying on a strong cycling team to take the reins and win many medals in the midst of the Olympic Games.
After the big upsets in Beijing and London, expectations in Rio have been greatly reduced.
In the background, there have been many bad developments, including the resignation in April of technical director Shane Sutton over allegations of sexism and bullying, and the retirement of such big names as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But the first night after the track shows that Britain's epic reputation for perfect timing will be proven once again.
With the energy contract cancelled, the future of the Portland refinery is in doubt.
The future of the Portland aluminum smelter in Victoria and the work of hundreds of workers became uncertain after one of the plant's owners announced the termination of a supply contract that would lead to the termination of all supply contracts by the energy company that supplied the plant.
This move followed the decision by the Victorian government earlier this year not to exceed subsidies to keep the facility operating.
The 20-year fixed-rate subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa's Portland facility.
Any shutdown could put as many as 2,000 jobs at risk, directly or indirectly.
And since the reactor consumes about 10 percent of all of Victoria's electricity, there could be additional chain effects.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's coal mine, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland refinery is losing money and at risk of closing.
These developments came after speculation over the past several years about the future of the facility, initially based on the strengthening of the Australian dollar and recently the facility's consumption charge.
AGL, which supplies power from the Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley to the large aluminum smelter, said it expects the other three owners to act to cancel their contracts.
The vast majority of the facility is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, and China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp have smaller stakes.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue operating, which means the physical electricity demand of the shale will continue", he said.
The AGL stated that the contracts were "risk-balancing contracts" that were to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will be completed in 2017.
The energy company said, "Therefore, AGL will continue to expect the contracts to contribute to the 2017 fiscal year".
The effects that AGL may be exposed to on potential earnings for FY 2018 and beyond are limited to the adoption of a strong forward contract position for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said that the value of its contracts in its accounts had already fallen to $187 million due to "expected liquidation".
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to operate the refinery or to provide electricity to the refinery".
The U.S. company signed a 20-year contract in 2010 that was supposed to go into effect in November of this year, but it did not explain why it has not yet withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts are wary of the possibility of closures at both the Portland shale mine in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle due to economic troubles in the sector.
Stephen Mikkels, AGL's operations manager, responding to analysts earlier this week, said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year, and Tomago uses 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants are withdrawn from the market, it will cause a significant drop in demand in the [electricity] market.
And that's not a good development for us as a producer".
Not only is she the star of the Kardashian TV show, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, the fourth daughter of model and executive mom Kris' Kardashian-Jenner group, is on the cover of the highly anticipated September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, an Estee Lauder brand ambassador who has appeared at Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
Kendall wrote, "I cried when I looked at this cover in a room full of people I loved".
Following the cover's unveiling, a bizarre (or just typical Keeping Up with the Kardashians) scripted reality video was released featuring the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (Rob and Caitlyn, who were the bar trouble, and everyone's favorite showbiz uncle, Ryan Seacrest), in which the family who forgot their sisters' cover had then prepared a classic ending: they were actually preparing a surprise party.
While this is a cliché story line from almost every "birthday" episode of children's television (Seacrest says, with the cartoon rabbit's heart at 8 a.m., "You think we forgot you?"), Chris had to somehow include the other girls in this introduction.
With this development in the September issue of Vogue, we're definitely entering a new era of Kardashians.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have outdone her in appearing on the cover of Vogue (she shared the cover with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September cover is a success in its own right.
The September issue of Vogue was the best-selling issue of the year.
The issue attracted the attention of many advertisers because it was thicker than a fashion magazine, more like a coffee table book (Fashionista found that 615 of last year's 832-page volumes contained advertising content).
The cover star's unveiling is also a closely watched process, with the last two years of the magazine's images leaking before the official announcement.
Women who have previously appeared on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has featured more "modeling celebrities" than "famous models".
Oscar-winning Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, and the following year, the honor was bestowed on Lady Gaga.
But even if Ms. Jenner, described by the magazine as a "shining model" of her generation, is in the previous category, her surroundings are quite good.
These celebrities are not relatives of celebrities or reality TV stars or the kids of today who know how to make good Snapchat videos (although Jenner is all of those).
These are all women who have legitimate talent, who are at the forefront of the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who was on last year's cover, had one of the best moments of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Because of her reality show background, Jenner's place in the fashion world will always be disturbing.
In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the whims of time".
When news broke that Jenner was going to be on the cover of Vogue, the idea resurfaced.
But it seems inappropriate to focus on dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She's literally a supermodel.
He's going to Marc Jacobs' shows.
He's giving you the Estee Lauder Fund.
She and her sisters sell their own pictures on paid wall apps about you.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine, which he photographed.
And in her spare time, she's probably just doing reality TV shows to see her brother Kourtney and her kids.
Community legal support centers reject 160,000 people every year
As the sector prepares for the impact of further funding cuts on already struggling operations, more than 160,000 people from the nation's most vulnerable sections are being turned away from community legal support centers.
In Queensland, three out of five people (mostly elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without the resources to fight unfair eviction decisions, etc.) are turned away when seeking free legal advice and representation.
Social legal support services, which have exhausted their resources, are preparing for further cuts.
Starting next June, these legal aid centers are scheduled to be stripped of more than 30 percent of their federal funding.
James Farrel, Queensland Director of Community Legal Support Centres, reported that the latest Census Report of the National Association of Community Legal Support Centres found that thousands of people are turned away every year.
Mr. Farrel has stated that the situation will get much worse if the federal government's decision is not reversed.
"Queensland's community legal support centres are chronically under-supported financially, which means thousands of people are not able to access the vital services they need", he said.
People in violent relationships, people struggling with the forces that are breaking the government, families in the process of separation, and workers unfairly dismissed -- all of these are facing problems with legal dimensions and are not getting the help they need, according to this report.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which means thousands of vulnerable Queenslanders will have to deal with more complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately withdraw these funding cuts so that people can get the support they need when they face a legal problem.
Last year, the government delivered on its promise to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
Now we need to look at the community legal support centers and the communities they serve and the investment that the Palaszczuk government is going to make in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign team sued after staff claimed they pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign team has been sued for allegedly failing to take action after the North Carolina director of operations was told he pulled a gun on a staff member while riding in a jeep in February.
The case was unsealed Wednesday in a lawsuit filed in state court by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor on the state campaign team.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be dealt with from the inside, but then realized "it's not going to happen".
As Bordini's complaint states, the Director, Earl Philip, "took a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and held the barrel to Vincent's kneecap".
According to the complaint, Bordini complained to local and regional campaign leaders and learned that at least four other people had the same experience as Phillip.
Bordini complained that "guns don't need to fire to do damage".
The case was filed two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused outrage in a crowd in North Carolina by telling "Second Amendment people" (apparently gun owners and gun supporters) that he might take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and chose her own judges.
Trump's campaign team said the media took these words out of context and that he did not support violence.
Bordini's complaint seeks compensation from the campaign team for negligence and from Phillip for assault, battery and bodily harm.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Their efforts to reach Phillip were in vain.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
There was no quick response to the call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial campaign.
Bordini, Donald J. Trump For President Inc., case 16-CS-14300, Court of Common Pleas, High Court Division, Mecklenburg Accident (Charlotte), where the defendant was charged with the murder of a child.
The "FETÖ" line is calling.
After President Erdogan's call for FETO members to "not know intelligence, not know security, report" the MIT and the Security FETO set up a hotline.
New practices are being launched to detect "hidden congregants" who have been hiding while thousands of FETÖ members were being kicked out of institutions after the July 15 coup attempt.
In the framework of the studies, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stressed the importance of the information that the citizen will make in the fight against FETO. "Friends from that community can be your friends, I say that you should disclose them".
You need to report it to the prosecution.
It's a patriotic debt.
"Everybody may not know intelligence, security may not know or may not catch up. Look, the guys are running".
Within the scope of the work carried out, the Ministry of Interior, the General Directorate of Security and the National Intelligence Agency (MIT) launched the online notification application.
According to this, the citizen will be able to communicate to the security and MIT those who serve FETO around him, the activities of the organization he knows, the institutions belonging to the organization.
The information of the persons who will report using the form provided to the service via the links www.egm.gov.tr/pages/input, www.mit.gov.tr/addkiniz will be kept secret.
The report application, which is being presented by the police department, will allow those who wish to submit a document.
Again, the same app will be returned to the whistleblower if he so desires.
Citizens can also notify the Prosecutor's Office of the provinces and districts where they are located by telephone to the "155 Police Emergency" line.
Inspired by Bodrum, they made Sivas a 'model village'
Canköy, Kaymakamlık and a charitable businessman from Gölova district of Sivas made it a 'model village'.
In the village where the roads were paved and the sidewalks were paved with cobblestones, all the houses were painted blue and white, modeled after the Bodrum district of Moghul.
Gölova Kaymakamlığı has prepared a model village project to improve the image and quality of life of the villages belonging to the district.
In this context, the village of 66 numbers Canköy, 12 kilometers away from the district center, was chosen as the model village.
The roads of the village, where infrastructure and superstructure services were increased, were paved, and the sidewalks were covered with parquet stone.
The village houses, which have different shades of color, were painted with the support of businessman Selahattin Ayan, owner of Pelit Pastaneleri.
The whole village was covered with the image of buildings painted in white and blue.
BODRUM is taken as a sample
Erkan İsa Erat, the head of the Gölova Kaymakamı, who provided information about the study, said that they prepared the project to sign a study that would become a role model for other villages: "The village should look more modern, the houses should all be the same color.
When we started this project, we were looking for a place to sample.
When we went to Bodrum, we were struck by the sight of houses painted white and windows blue.
We wanted to emulate Bodrum for its cleanliness and its positive impact on people.
We did our research and painted all the houses in Canköy white and blue.
This study was done in collaboration with the government and philanthropy.
The project cost about 200 thousand lire.
By studying, our village in Sivas has become like a small Bodrum.
We want to continue this kind of work with our budget and with the support of our business people.
The village manager, 66-year-old Abdullah Macit, said that with the support of Kaymakamli, the village has gained a completely new image.
Macit thanked all those who worked, saying that they and the villagers were very pleased to be an exemplary village.
Drug operation in Kangal
Seven people were detained in the Kangal district of Sivas in a drug operation organized by gendarmerie teams.
The gendarmerie teams working in the Chetinkaya Municipality of the district with the help of narcotics detection dogs seized 600 grams of marijuana, 49 drugs, 1 hunting rifle and 1 dry pistol.

The asset fund under review is back in commission.
The Turkish Savings Fund, which is expected to be among the largest funds in the world, was silently outlawed over the protests.
It was decided to re-examine the fund due to the lack of a control mechanism, but it was re-examined in the commission without any changes.
The CHP MP and Member of the Planning and Budget Commission Utku Chakirozer, who evaluated the Turkish Savings Fund law proposal brought by the AKP to sozcu.com.tr, said, "We are definitely against the exclusion of this structure, which will consist of mandatory pension cuts from public assets, workers and employees, and the unemployment fund collected for the unemployed, from the constitutional control mechanisms".
The Turkish Savings Fund bill, which the government drafted to provide long-term funding for investments and projects, was struck down on Tuesday by the opposition's view that it should be discussed separately.
But today, the AKP has re-introduced the proposal to the Planning and Budget Commission.
The CHP member of the TBMM Plan and Budget Commission, Utku Chakrozer, told sozcu.com.tr about the concerns of the CHP regarding the proposal of the Varlık Fund law.
"When the bill was presented to the Planning and Budget Commission, former Finance Minister Zakariya Temizel, who was in charge of the CHP delegation, expressed our concern and suggested that this be taken out of the bill and discussed in detail".
The government, which accepted our view, withdrew the bill.
The bill was re-commissioned yesterday in the same state.
"The government seems to be insisting on removing it from the parliament within a week", he said.
He said that the issue of the law on the existence of the Fund should be agreed upon.
"The assets of the public, the compulsory pension cuts of the worker, the income from the unemployment fund collected for the unemployed, the income obtained without privatization, are being transferred unlawfully to a structure that is outside the control of the Meeting and the county register and has no responsibility", he said.
He said that Russia, China and the Gulf states where such funds are established have oil revenues and trade surpluses and that the fund is financed in this way, "But we have a savings gap".
So the fund will be publicly funded, the people's money.
The total of 100 billion in the unemployment fund, 100 billion from the individual pension fund forced on employees, 50 billion without privatization is planned to be transferred.
"This means that the fund, which will be entirely funded by the people, must be under public control and this money should not be spent irresponsibly", he said.
The Minister stressed that it is unacceptable to keep a fund that collects state resources and guarantees state assets in borrowing outside the control of the Meclis, and expressed his concern about the proposal of the law on the Fund of Assets:
The work and transactions of raising, spending, and borrowing such a large public asset cannot be conducted solely by independent audit firms.
There must be public oversight and a transparent structure.
The bill does not provide for the constitutional oversight and transparency of the Asset Fund.
There's no limit on how much resources can be transferred.
No one will be held accountable for how this fund is used.
The purpose of the fund is to finance large projects.
There's no need to set up an uncontrolled fund outside the budget.
Why don't you budget it?
And so, naturally, the question arises, "Why is the White House and Congress avoiding control?"
He said that he was not against the transfer of money to investments, but against the fact that this is done through non-transparent, non-accountable mechanisms.
But if the government insists on this, then we have to ensure that the international standards that apply in other countries where such investment funds are established also apply in Turkey.
It must be structured in such a way that control and accountability are introduced.
It should be built in such a way that there will be no shaibs, and that the citizen will be able to pay the account of his own money until the last penny.
"We are pleased that the AKP is listening to our criticisms in the parliament especially after the July 15 coup attempt".
We hope that the AKP will listen to our constructive criticism in this bill.
We are against the unregulated use, transfer, irresponsibility of those who use it, and the absence of public oversight.
"The Wanted Asset Fund can only be useful if these concerns are addressed", he said.
It was learned that efforts were made to reach a compromise between the AKP and the opposition on the proposed law.
"Our confidence in Turkey is reflected in our investments"
Speaking at a meeting in Istanbul, Ali Koç, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ford Automotive, said, "The 30 billion TL investment we have made in the last 5 years is a sign of our confidence in the future of our country".
The meeting was organized by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ISO) on the topic "Those who trust Turkey, those who produce in Turkey".
Speaking at the meeting, Ali Koc said, "We are not only expressing our faith and trust in our country with our partners, but we are filling it with our investments and actions".
The 30 billion dollars invested in the last five years is a sign of our confidence in the future of our country.
Turkey is a country that is not only attracting more foreign investment, but also a country with a reliable and fair legal system, a democracy in line with international standards, a qualified workforce and an ecosystem that promotes R&D, innovation, entrepreneurship and added value.
In the last few years, our government has offered our industrialists the most extensive incentives in our Republic's history.
"I believe that with these incentives and holistic strategies, we can launch a new 'Investment Campaign' that we need", he said.
Siemens Industry and Trade Turkey Board Chairman and CEO Hüseyin Gelis said, "No more incidents are a problem of one country only, we know this as global players".
We came to Turkey with a long-term view.
If we are united and united, our problems will be solved.
We were able to bring to this land what we couldn't have in Turkey 160 years ago.
We'll continue to be in these areas in Turkey.
"Of course we will build factories, but we must have an open horizon in this area", he said.
The President of Shell Turkey Ahmet Erdem stated that Turkey is one of the 10 priority countries for them.
We believe in Turkey's potential and future.
We have invested in many areas, primarily energy, and we continue to do so.
We thank our President, Prime Minister and Ministers for their work in support of international investors.
There are studies that provide confidence for international investors.
He said that this would increase the competitiveness of our country.
Sandoz/Novartis Turkey and Middle East Region President Dr. Altan Demirdere said, "Our Global CEO was coming to Turkey on August 10".
But the trip was postponed.
We objected to it.
Because the CEO's arrival was very important.
They've made requests for a bulletproof car, protection.
Then he came here and saw that everything was normal.
He left his guards and his car and returned home happy.
Investing in a country is like marriage.
First, if all goes well, you'll get engaged and married on a long-term basis.
We're married to Turkey, and we have no intention of divorce.
He's turned over the edge of the cliff!
Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım called on businessmen to participate in the consultation meeting on "Those who trust Turkey, those who produce in Turkey" held by the Chamber of Industry of Istanbul at the Swiss Hotel.
Prime Minister Yıldırım said that the sector that will provide Turkey with comparative superiority is the industrial sector, "We should not miss the process of transition to 'Industry 4.0' in the industrial sector".
"If we want to be the locomotive of our country and achieve the 2023 targets, we must think about the industrial revolution, the information and technology revolution and achieve it", he said.
On the night of July 15, Prime Minister Yildirim said that Turkey was turning from the brink of a great abyss, adding, "Those who intend to destroy the future of our country, those who try to destroy democracy, those bastards who do not hesitate to bomb our Gazi Meclis, if they succeed, today we were talking about another Turkey".
We were going to talk about a Turkey that was taken over by a coup, that was stripped of its national will, that was dropped from the League of Developing Countries, that was among the third world countries.
"Thanks to Allah, we have deflected this trouble with the wisdom of our people, the leadership of our Prime Minister, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the determination of our government", he said.
Prime Minister Yildirim continued: "We will quickly get out of this situation and look ahead".
It's never, ever right to live with a constant blow.
We have ambitious targets ahead of us.
This coup attempt did not shake the Turkish economy.
Those who expected chaos and crisis were once again wrong.
Today, our democracy and our economy are in perfect health.
Our banking sector, our financial sector, continues to function in a healthy way.
The external trade deficit appears to have fallen by 25 percent in 2015.
The current account deficit has fallen to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2015 from 5.8 percent in 2014.
We're aiming to get it down to four by the end of the year.
We will never change our firm stance on public finance.
Turkey's 2016 budget was more than the national income of 130 countries.
We've reduced the deficit from over 11 percent to 1.3 percent of national income in 2015, and we're trying to maintain that.
We're better off than the EU, we're better off than most countries in the world, in terms of public debt.
Our banking and finance sector continues to operate on solid ground.
"Our Central Bank has not felt the need to issue currency to the market despite July 15 and there is no reduction in our reserves, we have gross reserves of over 121 billion dollars".
Prime Minister Yildirim said that they will provide all kinds of facilities for the development of the economy, increase production and creation of new employment areas.
We have implemented and continue to implement many regulations, from stock amnesty to cash surplus and the re-establishment of a facility for the settlement of unpaid tax debts.
"You continue to produce for the country, continue to trust your country, and your government will continue to remove the obstacles in front of you one by one".
Hakan Shukur's father was taken to hospital for high blood sugar
Sermet Shukur, the father of Hakan Shukur, who was detained in the framework of the operation against the FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization in Sakarya, was taken to hospital due to the rise in his blood sugar during interrogation.
The operation against the FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization was launched by the Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic of Sakarya after the coup attempt on July 15 and the arrest of former national football player Hakan Shukur and his father Sermet Shukur was made yesterday evening.
Today, the father of Hakan Shukur, Sermet Shukur, who was detained in Adapazarı during Friday prayers, was taken to the hospital during the interrogation.
Sermet Shukur, who was hospitalized due to high blood sugar, is being treated at Sakarya Education and Research Hospital.
Turkey is not breaking away from the West, it is not giving up the European Union
Mehmet Şimşek: Turkey does not break away from the West, does not give up the European Union
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek, Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü and Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekci attended the meeting on "Those who rely on Turkey, those who produce in Turkey".
Speaking at the meeting, Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Faruk Ozlu said, "I think that many good results have come out of the developments that took place on the night of July 15 and afterwards".
The most important of these is undoubtedly the spirit of unity and togetherness that Turkey is deeply feeling right now.
The July 15 process showed how strong the dynamics of the Turkish economy is and how the society internalizes democracy.
"It is clear that for a society that has reached this level in economy and democracy and democracy, the next process will go better, easier and faster", he said.
"Turkey must be rid of this shit".
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci, who spoke on behalf of Faruk Özlü, said that they were having difficulty explaining the 15 July coup attempt to the world, and stated that they had mobilized as a government.
Referring to the interest reductions that banks have recently introduced, Zeybekci said, "If 63.4% of the profits of the top five percent of my real sector go to interest, we should concentrate all our efforts on this work".
That's why our president keeps saying it.
Turkey needs to get out of this crisis with the unity and solidarity shown by the real sector, the banking system, the government, the politics, the politics after the 15 July civil Turkish democratic revolution.
We welcome recent developments in this regard.
"In the coming period, we will ensure the sustainability of the competition, which started at the rate of zero points nine or eight per month, which was launched by the President of the Republic, by supporting the economy as a management", he said.
"Green passport, we will obey the order of our importer"
"In the coming period, the world will win, we will be the capsule", said Nihat Zeybekci, "Under the leadership of our President, our Prime Minister, we will not leave the country in the world untouched, we will not leave the door untouched".
We're not letting anyone we haven't contacted out of increased business.
"We will never and never ignore this, we will not be the birds in the hand while we are running after the bird in the branch".
Zeybekci also stated that in the future, exporters will be granted green passports, "One of the latest decisions is that the law came out, and now we have finished its regulation at the Ministry of Economy; we will give our exporters, approximately 17 to 20 thousand exporters, who represent this country, the privileged green passport, at the order of our exporter".
"Those who were found at the DARB entrance must be cleared of the state"
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek, referring to the July 15 coup attempt and the OHAL announced afterwards, described the coup attempt as a "nightmare" and said: "But it is behind us, we must look ahead".
He said that the OHAL was declared for two simple reasons: "Of course, those involved in this deal need to be cleared of the state and this process is working; but more importantly, serious administrative reforms were needed to avoid facing such attempts again".
As a necessary climate for these administrative reforms, the state of emergency was declared and so far, very serious structural reforms have been carried out.
"We have done all this, of course, within the democratic principles and the rule of law, and we will continue to do so".
Expressing that life has returned to normal in many areas, Shimsek stressed that there is no reason for companies and individuals who are not involved in the financing of terrorism to worry.
"I think the foundations of Turkey's democracy have been strengthened because when you look at the root of the problems in the recent past, you will definitely see that this betrayal network is at work.
"So the cleansing of this terrorist organization from the state, the fact that this period is ending in Turkey will strengthen Turkey's democracy", he said.
Expressing that the fundamentals of the economy are generally sound and that they have returned to the normal structural reform agenda without any delay, Şimşek said, "Turkey has returned to the original agenda, there is progress in structural reforms".
We don't have structural reforms, because populism, protectionism, is growing in the world.
"Turkey can only prepare for the future by reform", he said.
Finally, emphasizing that Turkey will not break away from the West, Shimsek said: "Turkey may have differences of opinion with our Western allies and friends, but Turkey does not break away from the West, does not give up the European Union".
He jumped into the sea from 25 meters and...
In Antalya, 17-year-old Shamil Tayyar Bayrakçı was hospitalized after jumping from a 25-meter-high cliff called 'Kartal Hill' into the sea.
Shamil Tayyar Bayrakçı, who was swimming with his friends in the evening on the Konyaaltı beach, then jumped into the sea fishing from the 25 meter high cliffs known as "Kartal Hill" below the variant.
Professional swimmer Shamil Tayyar Flagger injured his neck after hitting the water.
Flagsman, who had difficulty navigating the sea, was brought ashore by his friends, who were also professional swimmers.
Health officials who arrived at the scene of the incident after the intervention took Shamil Tayyar Bayrakçı to the Antalya Education and Research Hospital in an ambulance.
It was noted that there was no danger to the life of the treated flag bearer.
A friend of the flag bearer who testified to the police, "He injured his neck when he jumped from Eagle Hill fishing".
"We didn't see it coming".
25 dead - The Word newspaper
Residential areas in Sarmada Township, part of Syria's Idlib province, about 10 kilometers from the Cilvegözü Border Gate in Reyhanli District, Hatay, were hit by regime planes.
Local sources reported that 25 people were killed and 40 injured in the attack.
Two separate airstrikes were carried out by regime planes at noon and evening on the rebel-held town of Sarmada near the Bab-Al Air Border Gate in Syria, opposite the Cilveguzhi Border Gate.
Local sources said the airstrikes targeted residential areas and killed 25 people.
The blasts were heard in Reyhanlı, where 40 people were reported injured, and there are fears that the death toll could rise.

Two brothers were killed in Kahta
Two brothers were killed in a car attack in Kahta district of ADIYAMAN.
The incident occurred in the evening on Mustafa Kemal Street.
A 39-year-old man, driving a car with the registration number 02 KH 839 and driving towards the district center, was shot by an unknown assailant.
The car, which was being driven by Karahan, lost control after the fire, and crashed into another vehicle.
Meanwhile, the person who came next to the car, Ramazan Karahan, and his brother, 50-year-old Omar Karahan, were shot one after the other.
The Karahan brothers were seriously injured, and the attacker fled the scene on a motorcycle.
Police and medical teams were dispatched to the scene on the alert.
The seriously injured Karahan brothers were taken to Kahta State Hospital by ambulance.
Omar and Ramadan Karahan were treated in the emergency department and could not be saved despite all the efforts of doctors.
While the bodies of the two brothers were being taken to the morgue for autopsy, police, who were examining the mob and security cameras in the area where the incident occurred, began work to identify and capture the fleeing assailant.
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not just to our local communities and London, but to the country as a whole.
I think that this will make Heathrow as attractive as London 2012 is, which is where we've made incredible efforts to make sure that all nations and regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympics have been a huge advantage for Stratford and the East End.
And we're going to do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
We're going to create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs for our local communities alone, and we're not going to leave young people out of work around the airport.
There will be those who think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too much, as it was in London before 2012.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Games and that we would be a disgrace to the world.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they'll be proven wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers all the questions asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many people, not just a few.
The expansion creates 180,000 new jobs and an opportunity for £211 billion of economic growth, and leaves many skills and job opportunities both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow, who have put in place an infrastructure investment of £11 billion on time and within budget, from T5 (which has been voted the best airport terminal in the world for five years in a row) to T2 between the two busiest runways in the world.
We are now ready to offer a third runway, backed by private investment worth £16 billion.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK, and I have no doubt that the expansion of Heathrow will be.
It's time we channeled this Olympic spirit into Heathrow's expansion to secure our commercial future and create many skills and jobs that Britain will be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton, Chairman of the Board of Heathrow and former Treasury Commercial Secretary
Adblock Plus is "like a cat-and-mouse game" when it comes to blocking Facebook ads.
Attempts to block ad-blocking software for companies that make money from online advertising are like "cat-and-mouse games", according to one software company.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying its users could update their filters to block ads on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would change the codes around ads to make it harder for ad blockers to determine which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says he's cracking the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this advanced backlash between the open source ad blocking community and those trying to prevent them has been going on since ad blocking was invented", and that Facebook may soon produce its own solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fray shows how serious the industry is about ad blockers.
Last year, a study by Pagefair and Adobe found that nearly 200 million people worldwide use ad blocking software, four times the number of people who used this type of software in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook on mobile devices, mobile ads now account for 84 percent of Facebook's ad revenue.
A spokesperson said that mobile ad blockers are not effective on Facebook's mobile apps for social networking and Instagram, so the company is now pursuing desktop ad blockers.
And since Facebook thinks that this kind of move is worth the investment, desktop ads should still be able to generate enough revenue.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preferences" tool so people can better control what ads are served to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying, as they would also block some non-advertising content on the site.
A Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement, "This is not providing a good experience for people and we plan to address this issue".
Ad blockers are a blinding tool, so we're focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to give people control.
A woman runs into a Swiss highway, apparently committing suicide
Victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to a multiple vehicle collision on the highway with a woman in what appears to be a suicide early Thursday.
The incident occurred just after midnight on Thursday on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud.
Vaud police said in a statement that the woman lay "hopelessly" on the ground in the dark of night and was hit by several vehicles.
The 49-year-old Swedish woman, who apparently tried to kill herself, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Police said they interviewed several of the drivers involved in the incident but some could not be identified and asked them and anyone involved to report to them.
"A criminal prosecution has been opened as a 'reasonable' step to take in such cases", lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
However, it is not yet known whether the drivers involved in the incident will face any charges.
Could the collision have been avoided?
That's what the prosecutor has to determine", Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accountable.
In both cases (both involving a person who went out on the highway in the dark), the newspaper ruled that it was normal for drivers not to wait for a passerby to cross the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, in August 2014, a police officer who crashed into a man lying on the road near Paynerne on the A1 one night was found not guilty of causing death by negligence.
The 22-year-old victim was found drunk and slipped on the road.
The court said that the police officer responding to an emergency call had used the vehicle reasonably and that the presence of a man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation".
Anyone with information about the incident near Morges on Thursday should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
The new NASA climate model predicts that Venus once had conditions that were habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to explore the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, water-free surface and CO2-filled atmosphere, once hosted conditions similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have explained Venus' low rotational velocity in the past with its thick atmosphere.
But recent estimates suggest that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still be spinning slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of ancient Venus.
Although your planet has more dry areas than Earth, it may once have had enough water and protection from rapid evaporation with geographical variability.
The old Venus was also benefiting from a 30% dimmer sun.
"The slow rotation of Venus in the simulation of the GISS model caused the day side of Venus to face the sun for almost two months at a time", said Anthony Del Genio, a GISS scientist, in a news release.
This heated the surface, causing rain to form thick layers of clouds that act as an umbrella to protect the surface from the heat from the sun.
As a result, the average climate temperatures were only a few degrees colder than the Earth is today.
The model allowed for a story similar to the evolutionary hypothesis that planetary scientists had previously put forward for Venus.
Although once habitable, Venus has been exposed to a lot of heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.
Their oceans evaporated and the water vapor was destroyed by UV radiation.
The hydrogen ran out, leaving only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide, with its deadly greenhouse effect, the Venus we know today.
The researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate model in their Geophysical Research Papers.
Patrick Roy has resigned as Avalanche announcer.
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday as Colorado Avalanche assistant coach and vice president of hockey operations, citing a lack of say in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the development and stated that the club would immediately begin looking for a new coach.
"For the past three years", said Roy, 50, "I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination".
I spent the summer thinking about how I could improve and take this team to the next level, giving it the depth it needed.
To do that, the vision of the coach and the VP of hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with the vision of the organization.
He also needs to have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
At present, these conditions are not met.
Sakic, who brought Roy to the team on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
The nurse said, "Patrick informed me of his decision today".
She thanks him for everything he's done for our organization, and we wish him the best of luck in the future.
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach in his first season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He scored 112 points for the club and helped the team finish first in the league, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and missed the postseason in both years.
The Avalanche surpassed their 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and were five points short of the second-jocker spot in the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goaltender Roy won four Stanley Cups, two for the Montreal Canadiens and two for the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue talks with strike suspension
The strike of the North Sea oil workers was suspended due to pay and the chief negotiators began discussions for a new round of talks.
The strike against oilfield services company Wood Group is being carried out in stages on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
A joint statement said, "We have decided to restart the process to resolve the existing dispute as Wood Group and Unite and RMT unions".
Over the next few weeks, starting next week, we're going to have a series of all-day meetings to take a fresh look at the issues.
The workers' unions said the protest was their first in 25 years against wage cuts that could reach 30 percent.
Wood Group cut payments to contractors in the North Sea by about 9 percent this year due to negative market pressures.
After the company's process of reducing fees, in 2014 a 10 percent price reduction was applied to its coastal suppliers.
The company said the additional cuts would give the company the space it needs to get through a tough time in the market.
Shell has laid off thousands of people as it restructures its operations in the process of merging with British energy company BG Group and announced plans to cease oil and gas operations in as many as 10 countries.
Energy companies are under pressure from low crude oil prices, an economic situation created by Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson will meet with labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes in the North Sea.
As he said, the North Sea is vital to the regional economy.
He said in a statement: "We need an effective economy for the majority, not for the minority, in the North Sea and across the country".
Despite an average investment of around $7 billion over the past five years, in 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea.
Kepler has measured the rotation speed of stars in the constellation of Ur
With its latest mission, the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers create the most complete catalog of stars in the constellation of Uranus in terms of their rotational velocities.
The new data are helping astronomers understand why stars in the constellation rotate at varying speeds and how their rotation periods relate to planet formation.
Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis in Pasadena, said in a news release: "When we compare our results with star clusters, we hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of the solar system".
The planetary constellation is 445 light-years from Earth.
Most of the stars in the constellation formed 125 million years ago and are reaching a new stage of maturity.
They're spinning at the fastest speed they've ever been in their lives.
At peak spin speeds, stars in this maturing stage form large amounts of stellar wind.
These winds create a refractive effect on the stars as they move through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As a star ages, its spin rate starts to decrease.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of visible star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest catalog of spin speeds suggests that larger stars spin faster than smaller stars.
Rebull likened the stars to dancers, stating that the large ones performed their single-legged turns more slowly than the small ones.
Rebull said, "In the ball of the planet, we see that the slow-spinning stars are much heavier, and the fast-spinning ones are very light".
Because the planet is so close to the constellation, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing stellar properties and spin speeds.
Rebull said, "The young and old of the Milky Way constellation provides theoretical models for stellar rotations in both directions".
There's more to learn about how, when and why stars drop their spin speeds, why they put their "dancing shoes" in a corner, so to speak.
Rebull and his colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the spin velocities of the constellation Ulker in three new papers to be published shortly in the Journal of Astronomy.
