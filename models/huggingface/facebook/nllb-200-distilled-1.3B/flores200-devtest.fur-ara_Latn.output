This not only confirms that at least a few dinosaurs had feathers, an already widely held theory, but also offers details that fossils cannot usually provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brownish brown on the surface with a light underbelly or carotenoid pigments.
The study also provided information about the evolution of plumage in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed root called the spine, but had other feather characteristics (links and beards) researchers have deduced that the spine probably developed later in the evolution of these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but to regulate temperature or to display themselves. The researchers suggested that, although the tail is that of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows the plumage of an adult rather than a baby bird.
Researchers suggested that, although the tail is that of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows the plumage of an adult rather than a chick.

They discovered that the sun operates on the same principles as other stars: it was found that the activity of all the stars in the system is governed by their brightness and rotation, and nothing else.
The brightness and rotation are used to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is relative to magnetic inversions.

The report is highly critical of nearly all aspects of the Executive's current policy toward Iraq and insists on an immediate change of direction.
The first of the 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative be taken before the end of the year to secure Iraq's borders from hostile interventions and to re-establish diplomatic relations with neighboring countries.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would have to be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, thus determining tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter has an effect on other dark matter in much the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy lies around the galaxy in the form of halos and is made up of many small particles.

No other transport will be added and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks or exchange parking there are not available.
The fear of a lack of transportation led to speculation that the game would be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published today in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian islands of the Galapagos.
According to researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden, the species evolved in only two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer, due to reproduction between a Darwin's frog (endemic species), Geospiza fortes, and a cactus frog (immigrant species), Geospiza conirostris.

Finally, there are also many small cats (such as house cats) that eat many smaller and much more numerous prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, or a special job that each cat has and thus does not put him in competition with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called herds.
The herd contains one to three adult and up to thirty lionesses and cubs.
The males are usually closely related, as this is a large family of sisters and daughters.

A true athlete, the tiger can jump (though not quite as well), swim, jump very long and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (or genus) as the lions, leopards, and jaguars.These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as full as that of the lion but is more like a roar, like when drinking.

Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find food (or prey) through sulfate, swimming to land where the animals are.
They can see very well in the dark due to their night vision, and also move very flat. Ocelots catch prey by masquerading as their environment and then jumping around the prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originate (for example if they cross a mountain range or a river or if they move to a new island from which it is difficult to return) they will find themselves in a different environment than where they were before.

The original population has not changed at all, and still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it begins to look less and less like that other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be considered the same species.

Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything other than other mosasaurs.
His long jaw was studded with over seventy high teeth, along with another set of teeth in the roof of his mouth, so he was no escape from what or why he was facing.
It is not known for certain, but it may have had a bilingual language. Its diet included cranes, crabs, other mosasaurs, and it may have been a cannibal.
It also killed anything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with it.
Although much of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual things to eat, such as quail, peacock, quail, and a type of rodent called glyr.
Another difference was that while the poor man and woman ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to lie on their sides while eating.
The pastures of the ancient Romans could not include foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no cereals, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa and no ancient Romans ever sought the turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods which was considered to be the house of the god.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.

A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
Civilization derives from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, relative to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and in some ways also defines the size of a society.
City states are the forerunners of nations.A civilizing culture involves the passing of knowledge through several generations, a persistent cultural footprint, and equitable diffusion.
Lesser cultures often disappear without leaving visible historical traces and fail to be recognized as de facto civilizations.

For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size in the late analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly the ratio has been inherited from digital image sensor formats.
35 mm is a bit of a rough format, in fact it is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The ratio of this format (divided by two to obtain the easiest ratio in integers) is therefore called 3:2.

To understand the Templars one must understand the context leading to the creation of the order.
The era in which events unfolded is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (10001300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism encompasses a range of ideas, from technological progress or technological imperative to a narrow sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path independent of cultural and political influences, and that technology in turn has effects on societies that are congenital, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the automobile necessarily leads to road development.

The mass motorization also leads to more road accidents, which leads to the development of new medical techniques to treat damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, as demonstrated by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.

Like Paris, which is now known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of light began in 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
Their status declined by the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as chairs and drugs that were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.

Suspension agriculture is agriculture carried out to produce food in sufficient quantity to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and often biological system that uses seeds sown native to the ecological region combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by social patterns and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, position, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that make a subculture distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to evaluate the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their upbringing.
Borro, or wild, were these children.Some wild children were kept in confinement (usually by their parents); in some cases, the child's abandonment resulted from the parents' rejection of a child with a severe physical or intellectual disability.
The rescued children may have experienced severe childhood abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaped.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived wild on their own.
When fully grown from non-human animals, feral infants show behaviors almost entirely similar (within physical limits) to those of the particular animal that cared for them, such as its fear or indifference to humans.

The Internet brings together elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the internet have led to a further dimension in the account of uses and rewards theory.
learning andsocialization are suggested as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement andcontinuous relationships were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, mouse movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can perceive whether a person is counting kisses by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, pointed out that people who are unable to understand a speech for a lady in the brain, leading to it, can accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that these abilities in interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variations: latent and overt.
Mutation adds new genetic variety and selection removes it from the set of obvious variations.
Segregation and recombination push back and forth the variety between the two sets with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet the demand for amino acids with available plant resources.

All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem in much the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of falling asleep during the normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a small enough switch that brings you into consciousness without waking up completely.

Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, forcing yourself to urinate.
The amount of peace a person has inside is inversely related to the amount of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Each person has the potential to find total peace and contentment.

It would last for the next 40 years and be fought heavily, by proxy armies, on the battlefields of Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
17 September 1939, the Polish defences were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize on the Romanian bridgehead.

Utilising ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the job of the Marines was to ensure that their nation maintained the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with the ability of the enemy to move people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help the United Kingdom.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably have to conquer the UK as it had done with the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in flocks roaming hillsides or other grazing areas, often cared for by shepherds who were often children or young adults, similar to the better-known sheep herders.

Although wagon tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and carry larger camels than those on the slightly steeper roads of the time.

This became common practice, but iron was used more often on wooden chariot wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron railway was introduced.
The earliest known means of transport is walking, humans began walking around two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning straight man).
Their predecessors, australopithecus, did not walk upright in the usual way.
Bipedal specialization is found in australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
One can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, one can join environmental movements and one can even become an activist to partially reduce future suffering.
This is intended as symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if not only a temporary solution is desired, then the root of the problem should be found and deactivated.

Following its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten stamp signed by Speaker of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
The next day, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as the Dunlap Flyers.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall at 8 a.m.
One was sent, on 6 July, to George Washington who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap flyers known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of that document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today.We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.

There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or the best interests of their child, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their children.
In an adoption, the natural parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.

Naturalistics and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific subjects, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from the Greek roots of philosophy and science.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that carry forward a period of free-running cyclicity even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to graft their DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments either by labeling the DNA in bacteria with radioactive phosphorus or the bacterial protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the touch of affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells were germline cells.

In developed nations, similar levels of complaint about water quality or falling bridges are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems generate these complaints, why do they fail every other day?Are transport engineers really incompetent?Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual vehicles and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Luckily, drivers tend to behave within a constant enough spectrum; thus, traffic flows tend to have some constancy and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships aid in the planning, design and management of road infrastructure.

Content theories focus on finding what makes people tick or what appeals to people.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize as they mature into adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they want and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory.

The need to nurture the interest of the audience inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings as well as outline their views on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the cultural capital of Canada and offers an assortment of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these and more things make Ontario what is considered to be Canada par excellence by foreigners.
Larger areas further north are rather sparsely populated and some are wild and almost uninhabited.
To make a population comparison that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
