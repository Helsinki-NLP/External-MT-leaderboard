UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons would only worsen the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet this month with the foreign ministers of the five permanent council members - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that divisions within the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers had made this situation unresolvable.
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity shown when they succeeded in reaching an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thereby addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 figures from the polls showing that Donald Trump has a real chance
Some have tried to label him a "flip-flop" politician.
Others called it a joke.
And others are waiting for the implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to topple Donald Trump from the top of the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump leading by a double-digit percentage and some voices are beginning to seriously wonder what this means for the real estate mogul's chances of getting appointed.
Of course, it's still too early.
None of this says that Trump will win the race for the Republican nomination.
Pundits show that, at the same time in 2011, Rick Perry's lead was giving Herman Cain a place in the polls, but neither of them won any state in the nominating race.
And the reasons why he would fight hard in the general election are numerous.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative Club for Growth acknowledge Trump's power and begin to support him with money.
Here are some recent polling numbers that suggest the real estate mogul is not just a passing fad:
The numbers that indicate support for Trump have turned 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage had climbed to 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Today, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion.
Those figures are holding.
A poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60 percent of Republicans in the region have a favorable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination race.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67% of Republicans said they would be "excited" or "thrilled" if Trump won the nomination race.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "overwhelmed" if Trump won the nomination race.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be "enthusiastic" versus 40% who say the same about Trump).
The closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say they would be "displeased" or "upset" if Jeb Bush wins the nomination race.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for his swearing and bombastic style, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to a poll conducted by ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
We see the same numbers in Iowa, where 52% of Republicans believe Trump has the personality to be a leader, according to a poll last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% believe he lacks the personality to be effective, and nearly six in 10 independents say his temperament has no place in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When I take the intellectual stance, Republican voters think Trump is authentic.
According to a CNN/ORC poll last week, when asked who was most likely to win the race for the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump.
That's a far cry from late July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, GOP voters haven't read the future very well.
In the same time frame of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the nomination race, versus only 28% for Mitt Romney.
But these figures show that a majority of GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even though the Republicans have retreated to another candidate, Trump is still in the lead.
Some voices say the divided situation will likely contribute to Trump's victory, while the support against Trump will be split across more than a dozen candidates.
But a poll conducted in early September by Monmouth University shows that in the hypothetical scenario of a collaboration between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always have the support of the majority.
Trump is 13 points behind Carly Fiorina, 14 points behind Marco Rubio, 15 points behind Walker, 19 points behind Jeb Bush and finally, 33 points behind Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's almost on a par with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who can beat him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one matchup.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll released Tuesday shows that more than half of voters who support Trump say they won't change their vote.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard, and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% say they leave the door open to changing their choice.
However, Trump's most important opponent is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but he is twice as likely as voters who say they decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has been the central theme of his 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic style will lead to a split between prominent Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and harm rebranding efforts.
But according to an ABC/Post poll conducted on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So it seems as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, so too will Donald Trump.
Frustration with authority reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of Republican voters, largely due to their outsider status.
According to an ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider over someone with experience in government.
People are also angry at the authorities in Washington.
A poll conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with the performance of Republicans in Congress, with 54% saying they are "displeased" and 21% saying they are "nervous as hell".
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut on Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at the PMQs has been long awaited
The new Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will later make his debut on Prime Minister's Questions, facing off against David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of his six questions shortly after lunch; his performance will likely be closely scrutinized by the media and Labour MPs.
In his weekly appearances, he called for "less theatrics and more action".
He also stated that he could give up some of his shares and that he would give them to his colleagues.
The showdown will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test as leader, coming after he appointed a 'ghost cabinet' and delivered a speech at the TUC's annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's decision to keep silent at the national anthem service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain drew criticism from some Conservative MPs and made headlines.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention.
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he "kept his silence respectfully" and acknowledged "the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight that he would have recommended the Labour leader sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
A dozen or so shadow ministers refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's frontline team, arguing that they had differences of opinion on the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party backed him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences are "piling up" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment over his stance on the European Union and the benefits cap.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour would make changes that would completely remove the idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the Minister for Work and Pensions, said the party was very clear in its exclusive opposition to the government's plans to reduce the level of the 'cap' from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron in the stands in the last decade since he took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas from "outside sources" for questions to ask Mr Cameron and that he has received over 30,000 suggestions.
MP Islington North said PMQs involve too much confrontation and that he would refrain from retaliation and attacks, committing to focus instead on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, would take his place at PMQs when he was unable to attend - for example when Mr Cameron was travelling abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak occasionally, saying that he approached the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took over, Mr Cameron said he wanted to drop the "Punch and Judy" style of politics often associated with PMQs but admitted a few years later that he had failed in his endeavour.
Since its first transmission in 1990, PMQs have been considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, how he or she leads the House of Deputies and his or her standing among fellow parliamentarians, although critics claim it has become a caricature and needs a thorough reform.
Snapshot in Joburg: Homeless youth benefit from photography classes
It's hard being a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who had lived on the streets as children found a way to learn a trade and earn a living.
I was shot in Joburg is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth to take photos of the areas where they live and make money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
JD Sports' head says higher salaries could hurt expansion
JD Sports chairman Peter Cowgill says a minimum wage increase in the UK could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.
However, it is unlikely that this purchasing power would exceed the higher labour costs within the firm, he argues.
Costs could impact JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by the president of Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a casualty in the "furnace" created around her friend, Nick Kyrgios, and her behavior deserves praise rather than criticism, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger half of the talented duo often referred to as the "Special Ks", was unpleasantly dragged into the limelight by Kyrgios' scandalous skid against Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a shaky qualifying game played shortly after in Cincinnati, the bench referee had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison stated: "Wawrinka should have put down Kyrgios, and I should have put down this kid".
Although he was last seen making a rocket dust after having muscle cramps and missing a possible US Open, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he is fighting Sam Groth for the singles second place, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against England.
"One thing I feel strongly about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was drawn a little bit into the conflict", Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a racket when he lost because he had cramps in the US, but he's not the first player to break a racket out of frustration with himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he wouldn't be proud of that.
But let's be honest, he handled himself extremely well in pretty challenging situations in the U.S. with Harrison and so forth and I think he's worth a lot of trust.
He's got a great team, he's got a great family behind him, and I think he's been treated unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard and he's integrated into the team, he's had no conflict with the other players, he's very respected in the dressing room, he's training hard, he's in great shape, he's a very balanced and mature young man, and I think he deserves to be judged solely on his strengths and his weaknesses.
Healy also supported the decision to not count Kyrgios in the important draw, which starts on Friday, and described the "shared decision" as the most suitable for everyone, but supported the return of the long-term Canberra native to the team.
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the draw and not think about the controversy around [Kyrgios] at all", Healy said.
And I think Nick has really moved up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have said, and he's matured in the public eye and he's made some terrible mistakes that deserve to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think he needs a little bit of time out of the spotlight so that he can reflect, which is good for the team and for him.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders has been cut in half in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a two-digit lead in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton is now backed by 47% of Democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is in second place with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is supported by 15% of Democratic voters.
With at least five months before the primary, most Democratic voters say it's too early to say they've decided on the candidate they'll support.
But Clinton supporters are more adamant in their choice than supporters of other candidates.
Compared to the CBS News poll last month, Clinton was losing ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders was gaining a few percentage points.
Clinton retains the lead among women and moderates, but the lead has diminished.
The men's support has dropped considerably and Sanders is only five points behind.
Clinton's lead among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now tied with Sanders.
Despite this, Clinton still has a lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by a double-digit percentage among liberals, but Sanders now has a slight five-point lead in that group.
About half of the nationwide Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were chosen to run for the party.
A quarter would support her somewhat reservedly and another 15% would support her just because she represents the party.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters would be excited about her election is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same about the first-place Donald Trump (35%) is lower.
When Clinton supporters are asked an open question about why they would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that it is time for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for the office (10%).
Clinton supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these aspects and eligibility shall also be mentioned.
With the vice president considering a possible run for president, 57 percent of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race -- though a third think he shouldn't run.
When asked about the second choice for party rep, Democratic voters overwhelmingly name Biden.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half said Biden would be the second choice, well ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the primary to 30 points if he does not run.
55% of Democratic voters consider Clinton the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, the numbers have fallen from 78% last month.
Biden is a distant second, but his top-percentage vote has increased.
Yet, when asked what is most important about an elected candidate, Democratic voters prefer issues over eligibility.
As was the case last month, no Democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as a party's candidate in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well on a few key characteristics relative to their party's primary voters.
Most voters consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be upright and trustworthy and to have strong leadership qualities.
Biden is seen the best of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of Democratic voters do not believe that Hillary Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15%), but 27% have no opinion about him in this regard.
Democratic voters also generally think that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideology as them.
On all of these issues, about a quarter of Democratic voters don't have an opinion about Sanders.
As questions persist about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and a server while she was Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the issue and say it didn't affect their overall opinion of the candidate.
But it's different with the American public.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only nearly a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March on the issue shortly after the matter came to light.
Most Americans say the email controversy hasn't affected their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36% say they've changed their minds negatively.
Mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10 say they've changed their mind about Clinton in a negative way.
While Democratic voters consider Clinton to be upstanding and trustworthy, this continues to be a problem for voters overall: only 32% consider her to be upstanding and trustworthy, 8% fewer than last month and 15% fewer than in May.
62% of voters don't consider her to be upright and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55% of voters nationally don't think Trump is upright and trustworthy.
Still, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush ranked first in integrity.
The number of people who think Sanders is a good guy is higher than the number of people who don't, but like Carson, many people don't have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the fraternity charged with the murder of a freshman at Baruch College.
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York City brutally attacked Chun Michael Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say the victim was blindfolded, put on a backpack weighing 14 kg filled with sand and was repeatedly rammed as he tried to head towards a target on frozen ground.
Mr. Deng complained of headaches after which he lost consciousness.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call the emergency number after he passed out and claimed they waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
They did find time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national fraternity president, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
At this point, members began to hide personal belongings and put the good of the fraternity before the good of Michael Deng, Wagner said.
He couldn't be revived and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated head, trunk and thigh trauma.
"Too many families have been devastated by the rituals of the fraternities, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life every year because of the rituals", Douglas Fierberg, the lawyer for Deng's family, said in a statement.
The Brotherhood and its members must be held accountable and this action by the authorities is important.
The Monroe County grand jury recommended that the first five members be charged with third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with contempt and complicity in murder.
"We want to hold accountable not only the people involved but if there is an organization that has authorized the fraternity, officially or unofficially, we will also hold it accountable", Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity withdrew its affiliation with the local chapter.
This is what happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
The interest rate will rise and the bull market will falter, bond yields will rise and the economy will go into recession.
That we know.
What we don't know is in how long it's going to happen and how long it's going to last.
In economics, history offers little indication of the timing of the events.
After the first increase in the interest rate, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor of how the economy and financial assets respond.
That's why U.S. central bank officials have been so emphatic that investors should not focus on when the interest rate starts to rise but on the trajectory of the time it takes to normalize.
Indeed, there are multiple variables at play.
But in the end, market players might find that all the excitement about raising interest rates was overblown.
The first interest rate hike by the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the 'cheap money' era, Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
On the other hand, we do not expect that the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal but still small levels will be the seismic shock that everyone seems to fear.
But it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
Here's how some sectors of the economy might respond based on historical trends:
Given the market situation in recent months, the anticipation of an interest rate hike may make things volatile for a while.
But at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
There appears to be a tendency for return on capital to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first increase, perhaps reflecting the reversal in monetary policy, Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after Fed increases.
More specifically, over the last 35 years, the market has risen sharply - by about 14 percent - heading towards the rate hike, fairly steady over the 250-day period after (each average 2.6%) and then returning to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron's by the chief strategist of Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche stated that the impact on equities tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate hiking cycle and benefits begin to decline.
Recessions are a fact of life, but rising interest rates often contribute to them.
In this situation, the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
More precisely, gross domestic product will approach its historic low for a Fed rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice has nominal GDP been below 4.5%.
Even though the second quarter of 2015 saw a 3.6% increase, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter hitting only 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
The interest rate hike in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question 'if this time is different', Deutsche said.
Market players have been bracing all year for a Fed decision to raise rates, with all eyes on this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an interest rate hike at this meeting, forward transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
In our study after 1950, all interest rate cycles to date have been in a super-profit growth cycle, with GDP eclipsing pre-recession peaks very quickly after recovery began, the report stated.
On the contrary, it has been an oddly slow recovery from the worst recession of the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has been waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this one has reached 74 months and counting.
Fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an increase in the interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster for bonds than for equities when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, it appears that the benefits change direction as soon as the first up/down in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the rate hike cycle, bond yields immediately decrease, Deutsche said.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any information on the level of the measures in question.
High-yield bonds do better in such an environment, though "we're still cautious about forcing yields", said Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adjusted to the Fed's policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in estimated inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy", Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is straighter, the average credit rate spread has widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens policy.
In general, companies with a majority of their business in the US will benefit from the interest rate increase and local products will become more attractive.
The big debt-laden multinationals will suffer because the rise of the dollar will make their products more expensive in the global marketplace and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial interest rate hike", Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Schultz said in a client report.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed those with weak balance sheets after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
The companies with high capital gains and low volatility stocks also outperformed the lower quality peers by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
The debt will become a major issue.
The companies with the highest percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also benefit from the increase in the dollar.
Those who save may also benefit, although experts disagree about how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised the radio station for being "simple"
He says that he's becoming more and more like his commercial rival
He also took to the eyes of the BBC Music Awards, claiming that they plagiarized the Brits awards
Fellow Damien Collins has attacked The Voice, claiming that this show is not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is 'turning into' Classic FM, a senior MP has said, putting pressure on the station to prove it does something commercial stations don't do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public broadcaster was "going crazy" and looking more and more like its commercial rival.
"I feel like Radio 3 is 'stupid' - I don't like to use the word - but I feel like it's turning into Classic FM", he said.
He also took to the eye BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, seem to be Brits under a different name.
So if you try to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind that just copy what's already on the market", said Mr Bingham.
The BBC's chief executive denied the allegations, stating that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival in live music and audience education.
I'm not going to find out about classical music on Radio 3 from anywhere.
And his commitment to live music and production is unrivaled.
'In addition, I think it is also important that Radio 3 is committed to discovering new music and allocating new tracks,' he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he had to work harder to attract audiences than he had before because the British public had less knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only BBC item to be criticised at the Culture, Media and Sport committee meeting for following in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins has attacked The Voice - the talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you see why there is often talk about that show because it is not original and has nothing special?
Lord Hall insisted that the show made by BBC1 - with Paloma Faith and Boy George in the judging panel - be made in a BBC-specific way.
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find the golden goose in its own fold" the next time it launches an entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban future seasons of The Voice or spend the money that goes into licensing other forms of entertainment.
Online sales were the slowest in August and Black Friday could be to blame
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
The last month has seen the slowest growth since 2000.
Online sales took off three years ago, thanks to the use of mobile phones to make purchases.
Experts believe that Black Friday in November could lead to reluctance to spend.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned Britain's shopping streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are signs that online sales are slowing, with the latest figures showing a growth of just 7% in the first three months of 2015.
Total money spent in August showed the smallest increase since 2000, with an increase of just 5% in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are declining, with the latest figures indicating an increase of just 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If we look at the level of growth in previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalize over time", Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago when shoppers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
So, the number of people who could shop online and could shop in different circumstances, like from the couch, increased.
But now that it's stagnating a little bit, you might notice a decline.
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that shoppers would refrain from making purchases before the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers huddled in front of their computers to grab deals, leading to the collapse of several retailers' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers fought over bargains, could cause shoppers to be reluctant to shop.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium determined that at least 1 out of every 5 pounds is spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online rather than in high-end fashion stores.
After sanctioning the bin Laden family, Muslims bury victims killed in the crash of the crane in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were paraded through the streets by Muslims, with the first burials taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partially blamed construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
The Health Minister said that a total of 394 people were injured in the crane collapse
In a street-walking ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims killed by a crane crash at the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, mourners joined the road to express their condolences, until the first dead reached the end of the final journey, at the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sadly preserved memory of the holy site, where just a few days ago a construction crane crashed through the roof of the mosque, falling on the faithful.
The bodies were released for burial after the Saudi king sanctioned the Bin Laden family's construction group for the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
In a ceremony held in the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims killed by a crane crashed at the Great Mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was father of four, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the annual hajj pilgrimage began.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm raised when the crane was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, stated that the Binladin Group bears partial blame for the crash.
The English-language news agency did not elaborate but said that the company's leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to collapse in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet commented on the crash of the crane and representatives of the Group could not be contacted for comment.
The royal decree blamed the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and for not coordinating with the meteorological authorities.
Dozens of cranes surround the Great Mosque in Mecca as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with the Saudi royal family and has been undertaking major construction projects.
The last leader of al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegade" son, disinherited by his family in the '90s.
The crash occurred in windy and rainy conditions, just days before millions of people were due to arrive in the kingdom to take part in the pilgrimage, an essential journey for every able-bodied Muslim at least once in their life.
Authorities say 158 people remain in hospital.
Authorities have decided that the relatives of the deceased victims will receive one million Saudi riyals (£174,000) and the same amount will be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other casualties will receive half of this sum.
Advantages and disadvantages of converting loans into Swiss francs
Two offers for the conversion of Swiss franc loans into lei have already appeared on the banking market, the main advantages being the exclusion of foreign exchange risk and the reduction of interest rates.
The disadvantages may come over a few years, when variable interest can lead to higher rates.
Banca Transilvania has just completed the process of converting the loans in francs granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost has announced the conversion offer for its own customers.
According to the data collected by analysts of the financial portal FinZoom, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest in lei, 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, the conversion offer of the Transylvania Bank was accepted by 83% of the customers with loans in francs due to two successive reductions: the balance was reduced by the amount of risk and administration fees paid by the customer, then a further 22,5% reduction was applied to the lei balance.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to the equivalent monthly payment in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42,5% and Bancpost by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of covering loans in lei in CHF is that it eliminates the currency risk, the consumer is protected against future increases in the franc, and the repayment of the loan will be in the currency in which he receives his salary.
A further major advantage of both conversion offers is that no property reassessment is carried out, no additional guarantees and no further proof of income is required.
In practice, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the credit and no additional costs as in the case of refinancing.
Both banks also offer a monthly discount on the rate that customers had to pay before the conversion, equivalent in lei.
Risk to health
The problem is that the first-year rate is mostly interest and the client pays very little of the principal.
The Bancpost offer of very low interest for the first three years seems to be advantageous to customers.
But it is unknown how this interest rate will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers may be higher than 3,25%, therefore, in total, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all loans in variable interest rates is that the ROBOR index will increase significantly in the coming years (more than the Libor-CHF index).
For example, the three-month ROBOR is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached 6%, in 2009 it was over 15%, and in a few days in 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, other costs may arise, not mentioned in the initial offer.
It's time for interest rate decisions for the US Federal Reserve
The world is looking to the meeting scheduled for two days from now, on Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
In a Reuters poll of 80 economists, just over half of those who last week thought the decision would be made now believe that it will be for a while and that interest rates will remain in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rates down to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could abandon the zero rate and initiate a process of normalizing interest rates", said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has performed relatively well, with the recovery bringing trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating low inflation.
But the Federal Reserve must not ignore the less rosy global situation.
He warned markets to prepare for a rally, but there are signs that even they think such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
Stars who have lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has been through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he battled leukemia and in 2009 he lost his life partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
It is also rumored that the actor has faced a drug problem and in 2008 was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this is certainly costly.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw has been on the sidelines for a few months with a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right foot in the Champions League match against Manchester United, which ended in defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and will keep him on the bench for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The crash was caused by a reckless intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after Shaw, aged 20, broke through PSV's defence.
He received nine minutes of medical attention on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal stated: "He has a double fracture in his leg and is in hospital".
He's going to be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow and then he's going to have surgery in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, struggles, then plays fantastically and now something like this happens.
He's got an oxygen mask in his locker.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but with a double fracture, the rest is six months and he won't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Looks like Moreno got lucky and got rid of the red card and the penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say it's faulty and red card.
It was a very ugly intervention with two legs.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for the messages, I have no words to express how weak I feel, I am starting the road to recovery, I will come back stronger".
In similar news, Manchester United hit by injury Luke Shaw in defeat to PSV
The England midfielder has one more reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next June.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: "It's a very bad injury.
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players never aim to crash an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for Mexico against the Van Gaal-led Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very hard for him because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious injury, it's not good", Cocu said.
I didn't see the phase.
I could only see the ball, which was going in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] had touched it but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In his statement to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know what it is, I know how difficult it is to go through something like this.
I feel really bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked England's omission but he's still holding out.
Winning against Pakistan in the UAE is a difficult task, but after seeing England's selection for the tournament, I do not consider a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the Test matches.
I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a road win.
Alastair Cook's team may be less experienced than they were three years ago, but they have good players on the batting line and the collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a positive attitude of youth.
Moeen Ali is evolving as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even though unknown at the test level, is an option for the attack.
Similar topics: Adam Lyth left the England Test squad and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his head coach at Yorkshire, it's difficult for me to analyse the decision not to select Adam Lyth for the team.
He played seven Test matches against two good forwards in difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged by their results.
There were no question marks about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because -- and I said this before -- the players are their own selectors.
Some fifty years and perhaps Lyth would have extended his run but his fate lies in his hands.
I hope that if he does more runs for Yorkshire he will have other opportunities.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude even when his performance was not up to his ability, and I'm not surprised by that; first of all, he's a team player.
It's hard to answer the question in how long a batsman gets noticed in test matches.
Lyth had seven runs - as did Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton had luck at home and on the road.
The only grievance you can have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tournament - when Lyth was in peak form - but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
Joining the team is Alex Hales, a batsman I like very much.
He's a cricketer who has the X factor and who I noticed early in the Yorkshire season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors but that will depend on the composition of the UAE team.
There's been a pitch to Moeen to open the batting alongside Cook, which would take the extra spinner keeping four quicks at the same time, and I have no problem with that.
I don't see why a pitcher couldn't hit there and this left-handed pitcher has already shown he's a damn good one.
Moeen may not have brought success to his home county of Worcestershire, but he was number three for them, so the difference is not that big.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test matches as a first drop before going into the open in 2001.
He immediately erased three centuries and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari is coming into the team as a back-up spinner and, although I've had limited contact with him, it struck me that he's a very impressive young man.
People might judge his young age -- 31 at bat and 35 at ball -- and they might think he's a punt, but there aren't a lot of spinners and the selectors have gone for the young.
You'll learn a lot from this tournament.
England made some changes to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, Sri Lankan batsman, as the consultant for the Test matches could be a master stroke.
He's one of the best players and he'll bring a lot of experience, having played in every situation and against all types of attack.
Paul Collingwood is coming for the white-ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and ruthless ambition.
I always thought he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they're relaying messages that have been relayed before, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham's team-mate Ben Stokes is resting for the one-day matches, Root has been given a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
While not everyone agrees, coaches and scouts don't make the schedule.
And you have to remember, the jobs of the players depend on the results they get.
Decisions like this are never made lightly.
The Brexit camp could win the case if the economy stays in the doldrums until 2017
With each passing day, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets more and more tangled up, even without the brilliant Jeremy Corbyn's 'Yes or no?' Labour leadership or the TUC brings Tuesday's severe criticism of Europe.
The foreigners have their own characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained the other day that - in the midst of crises similar to the EU's - not all of which are caused internally - some member states are being fed the UK's agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which most of them do not want.
In Brighton, at the annual meeting, the TUC decided that they didn't want to do that either if it would erode social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie diary.
The prime minister and the chancellor attend summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, pose in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an outward-looking Britain under the roof of the EU - "Don't leave us alone with France", Berlin declares - suggests that more ministers and more obdurate officials in certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care whether they stay or go.
Angela Merkel, the extremely cautious German chancellor, is an ally but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation falters, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have been in power too long.
In 2017, the President of France, François Hollande, will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is declining.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It's hard to believe that this will help the English posing, whose energy would be better spent on preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - something they don't want either because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
So some ministers might even be planning to make deliberately unhelpful remarks, in the SNP style, in the campaign for the 2017 UK referendum to hasten the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
The renegotiation was fixed and the UK got nothing of value from the renegotiation.
Europeans know firsthand how hogwash Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the oligarchic press barons who are sceptical of the EU are, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn that ratified our 1973 entry into the Union at 2:1.
He may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist who became famous in the early 1990s when he was Brussels' correspondent.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of tax-dodging scumbags, foreigners who cheated on their phone and pseudo-non-homes who own most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them in much the same way, but he realized that when you're locked in a cage with a nervous gorilla, you have to give him bananas to distract him from the thought of eating you for lunch and then again for tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's referendum idea, given that Blair had made a concession on principle to the abandoned EU constitution buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me on the back in a friendly way at Westminster on Monday - I told him not to waste his time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting Neil Kinnock's 1980s Murdoch boycott strategy, a mistake then and now.
It may be tough, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy of media cooperation, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose BBC position was vacated on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I would leniently call evolution.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with the conservative Anglicanism might agree with this.
This was said by Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week, when the scout in him struggled to admit that Corbyn's appointment of John McDonnell as shadow finance minister was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the '70s, when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to fellow Labor members, without going too far and without losing his cabinet position.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the fight to stay "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not correspond with what McDonnell said and what JC told colleagues and MPs in the private meeting Monday night.
Whatever image Corbyn wants to convey -- and remember, he sensitized me, too -- message discipline remains important in the age of television and especially in the social media vortex, a hotbed of paranoia and treason.
It is right not to give Cameron a free pass to Europe, allowing him to take advantage of Labour's support in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell has claimed.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks this.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic sophistry about EU membership - in keeping with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his sophistry about NATO - Tom Watson is adamant that the JC will not campaign for resignation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should they waste Paris or Berlin's political capital - and there are voters who are suspicious - on concessions to Britain when it could all be useless?
The US is already pretty disappointed about the poor performance of the British military in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a Conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize decision of the Department of Public Health in England on e-cigarettes
According to the researchers, the claims of a government agency that e-cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom had ties to the tobacco industry.
The British Medical Journal (BMJ) editorial team joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by the UK Department of Public Health (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the 'reference' report last month and described it as a 'complex analysis of the evidence'.
However, some researchers questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the Lancet medical journal attacked the "extraordinarily fragile basis" on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ have questioned the claims and their foundation on solid ground or quicksand.
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: 'A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness.
They stated that they expected PHE's claims that 'current estimates show that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking' to be substantiated by a detailed analysis of the evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a model for the multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) that synthesised their views on the negative effects associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were presented briefly in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell or claimed that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco in the past to conduct an independent study.
It also validated the accreditation of BAT in public health in a sustainability report, it said.
They added that one of the 12 participants in the meeting had declared receiving funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not reported receiving funding from the cigarette and tobacco manufacturer Philip Morris International.
The arguments on which the panel members were selected were not provided, but they include some well-known 'leaders' in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of whom even declare in their works the financing of the industry.
Other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the Head of the Tobacco Control Unit at PHE.
The research paper produced by the group 'convincingly demonstrates that there is a lack of 'strong evidence of harmful effect of most products under most criteria', McKee and Capewell said.
However, the PHE report does not mention any of these links or limitations.
McKee and Capewell stated that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence to date that e-cigarettes are a factor in encouraging smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, the head of the health department at PHE, says he has responded to the BMJ's claims in the past.
He stated: E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking
One out of every two people who have smoked all their lives dies because of this addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are comparatively minor, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the evidence-based and evidence-based information, especially given the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers of tobacco.
Every year, some 80,000 people die from smoking-related illnesses, and the annual cost to the national health system from smoking is estimated at £2 billion.
By clearly stating the current evidence - that while e-cigarette use is not risk-free, it represents only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.

But a separate campaign has also led to the display of a large number of posters in bus stations and subways that need a second look.
"Important announcement, will you be travelling with DLR between 15 and 18 September?" says one of the announcements, using the fonts and branding of the London Underground, with the DLR line transforming into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will be storming the DLR Customers are being asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who exhibited at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.

One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and seeking to make political work accessible to the public outside of the galleries.
Many artists are turning to collaboration with activists in protest movements, realizing that they need to go out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another anti-gun poster greeting commuters on the subway.
The Amnesty video had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency who worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and voiceover artist also worked for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was shocked by the silence around the arms fair ad - with a blank space in the ExCel calendar - and thought "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid".
They played around with making it more realistic, but enriching it with animation and strong colors was more striking.
"They did a great job of helping us to raise interest in the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair", says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, what the UK authorities would need to do is to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not being illegally traded and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative art form on the arms fair theme comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastically euphemistic products.

Eight golden rules for living in the shelter

In Bach's time, there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, artists and not commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a less common, quite "strange", as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra consisting of international soloists and talented musicians, who perform a symphonic repertoire without a conductor, and will make it at least a curiosity in this classical music landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two shows: a performance on Sunday, with David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, as soloist, and a performance on Monday, with cellist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, with works composed by Enescu unseen.
Both performances, on the stage of the Athenaeum, showed the audience a different way of interpreting classical music.
Les Dissonances emerged on the music scene in 2004 as the only classical music ensemble at that time without a conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It's true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become performers in an orchestra -- I'm talking about instrumentalists, not composers.
They're trained as "specialized workers".
They themselves feel that they need a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, for the audience, all the musical fetishism is focused on the conductor.
And so the business, the music industry, is marketing itself.
So, let's not talk about music.
So if you look at this world, you have on the one hand skilled workers, which is stupid, and an audience that can't listen, but has to watch, which is stupid", David Grimal believes.
The violinist says that this change in the way he makes music came as a result of "musical lessons" from his solo career.
I was like a top-level athlete who had to do the same exercise all over the world with different orchestras to make a lot of money and bring money to the music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was in my early 30s, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found creativity and human brotherhood in this system.
So I don't see any reason to continue on this path.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This was in 2004, and at that time no one did this without a conductor: "The music world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects".
"How can you imagine marketing with a collective of musicians in which there is no ego?" asks the artist.
David Grimal admits that Les Dissonaces is "a luxury", noting that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project for their livelihood.
In the 10 years of the ensemble's existence, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be a hindrance in the musical act: "Curiously, the more complex the repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all the musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not just in the role", Grimal says, adding that at Sunday's performance "there were 74 conductors on stage".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is "very brave", precisely because he invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where the biggest orchestras in the world are present and play 3 times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras you invited this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, like the Enescu Festival, there is the place and the interest for something different, that breaks down barriers.
Speaking about Enescu's work, the violinist admits that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Romanian composer, so he did not need a special approach when introducing works by Enescu into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this is what happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal advocates for a change in the way classical music education is done, considering that "the profession of musician, as it is organized today, has a death knell" and that "the future of music is music itself".
We don't need to go around the world five times a year if it doesn't do any good.
In Bach's time, there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tours, releasing albums, all of them are formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they are in the service of music.
If not, we're in a system where creativity suffers, it has no freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example of Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: "In Romania, before joining the EU, you had good vegetables and meat".
To get into the EU you had to pass sanitary laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture are now at the service of supermarkets, as is happening in France.
With music, it's the same thing, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances make the roses not so pretty, but when you cut them they're real roses.
In an ideal world, this music should be back in the center and the institutions and industries that manage this system should understand that music does not need to be sold, it needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with education policy.
"If we consider - as the Koreans, Chinese, Japanese do - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we would reintroduce its learning in schools, we would reintroduce concerts on television and through this education we would no longer need to sell music by-products", Grimal believes.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that all over, it's something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline whether we compare a musician to a soldier, or whether we train a musician who will play an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
We're talking about a completely different education, if we want to train a soldier it has to be one way, if we want to train a musician it's completely different.
"What do you think is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" asks the French artist with a smile.
Grimal shows that for artists, the reward of a different way of making music comes precisely from overcoming this "soldier" status, overcoming what "they think are their limits": "The musicians discover at a certain moment that they are not soldiers, and that is why they come out of the concert smiling".
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and artist in the "Festival of Ideas", a discussion with the audience organized by the International George Enescu Festival by the Aspen Institute Romania.
The profile of David Grimal
After attending the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris under Regis Pasquier, during which time he received advice and encouragement from renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at the Ecole des Sciences Politiques in Paris before meeting Philippe Hirshhorn, who changed the course of his life.
David Grimal has an international career as a solo violinist, during which he has regularly performed for the past 20 years on the world's leading classical music stages and with prestigious orchestras such as the Orchestre de Paris, the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, the Russian National Orchestra, the Orchestre National de Lyon, the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, the Berliner Symphoniker, the New Japan Philharmonic, the Orchestre de l'Opera de Lyon, the Mozarteum Orchestraz Salburg, the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and the Warsaw Sinfonia, under the direction of conductors such as Christoph Eschenbach, Michel Plasson, Michael Schnᅢwandt, Peter Csaba, Heinrich Schiff, Lawrence Foster, Krivine, Mikhail Pletnev, Rafael Fruhbeck and Peter Eotvos, Andris Nons, Christian Arming.

In addition to his solo career, David Grimal has also been exploring more personal projects.
The freedom that a collaboration with Les Dissonances has given him has allowed him to develop his inner universe by venturing into repertoires that are not accessible to solo artists.
Along with Les Dissonances, he founded "L'Autre Saison", a series of concerts given for the benefit of and with homeless people at the church of Saint-Leu, located in the heart of Paris.
Since 2008, David Grimal has been Artist in Residence at the Opera in Dijon.

David Grimal plays a 1710 Stradivarius, ex Roederer, and also the Don Quijote, a violin designed for him by the French lutenist Jacques Fustier.
David Grimal was present on Sunday at this year's George Enescu International Festival with the Orchestra Les Dissonances, featuring Debussy, Enescu and Beethoven.
Les Dissonances took the stage again on Monday, this time with cellist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, and the program was composed of Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
City Cinema is looking for "Big Little Voices"
Cinema City is launching the greatest challenge ever for kids: the dubbing of two characters from the blockbuster "Snow White 3D".
You have a super-talented, spontaneous kid who likes movies?
Give him a chance to be a star.
In September, in its latest campaign for enthusiastic and ambitious kids between the ages of 8 and 16 who want to be future stars, Cinema City is looking for "Big Little Voices", giving them the extraordinary opportunity to voice two characters from a famous animated film.
If in the classic cartoons the emphasis was on the closeness of the voice of the actor to the specific character of the cartoon, in the last period, the creation of the story also takes into account those who are going to interpret the voices, and they are usually very well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that's why we are launching a new campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to enter their children in our contest.
They're going to have a special experience, because the characters are cute and the lines are funny.
"The children will have fun and will have a real chance to be part of a team of actors", said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, from September 11 to September 30, Cinema City organizes a pre-selection, after which 10 children (five girls and five boys) will be selected to have the opportunity to give a try in a recording studio alongside professionals.
All parents have to do is log in to micilevocimari.cinema-city.ro, where they can enter their child in the competition and prepare them for the voice test.
After that, they have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read, and then the child will record playing their own version of the dubbing.
Four films about friendship, fairy-tale heroes, magic and hope are up for competition: "Yellow Pencil 3D", "Moon: Guardian of the Moon 3D", "Blinky Bill: Koala cel poznaș 3D" and "White Maia 3D".
Finally, the two most talented children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream come true and will each voice a character from the superproduction "The Snow Queen - Snow Queen 3D", which will premiere in Romania in November this year.
FedEx profits are mixed, tax forecasts for 2016 are down.
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, with the delivery giant reducing its full-year profit estimates due to low demand for transportation services and increased costs for its ground transportation division.
The company also stated that it intends to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
At the same time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The company's stock was down about 2.5% in pre-market trading 45 minutes before the opening bell on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May of next year, 20 cents less than an earlier estimate.
Analysts had forecast a $10.84 figure, according to a FactSet poll.
The decreasing estimate comes despite the price increase of 4.9% on average, with the entry into force of January 4 and the higher surcharges for the inland transport of large or heavy parcels, which will apply from November.
The company stated that it still expected to increase its earnings compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and the development of online trade.
President and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company was facing a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, particularly in terms of global production and trade.
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said it planned to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number of hires it made last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6% from the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by the 12 analysts who responded to the Zacks Investment Research survey.
Profit increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in Zacks's survey estimated the total at $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority shipments, which has led to stagnation in revenues for its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has skyrocketed the bottom line for the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, ground revenue grew 29% but operating revenue stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenue due to higher base fares, while the freight division's revenue decreased due to rising costs.
At pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx shares had fallen by $3.85 or 2.5%, to $150.15.
Tuesday's closing was down 11% year-over-year and 17% from the record high on June 11.
In the most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide whether it's time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at one end of the central bank's boardroom, you'll see a mural of the United States.
The map is meant to remind us that Janet L. Yellen, the Fed Chair, and her colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above all else.
The Fed was given a dual task by Congress: to maximize the U.S. employment rate and to maintain price stability.
But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third burden could be the X factor in a decision that is too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the U.S. economy is prepared to be unleashed by the unprecedented stimulus offered by the near-zero short-term interest rate in effect since the end of 2008.
Even though most data points to a strongly growing economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare already cautious Fed officials from adding to the volatility by raising the federal funds rate - even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and foremost issues they will be looking at", said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
But I think that if they were looking for an excuse not to raise interest rates, the growing uncertainty in the global market is enough to give them reasons to wait longer, she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself causes instability in the financial markets.
About half of the economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg had anticipated an increase in the interest rate this week.
But financial markets are expecting the Fed to postpone, with a key indicator showing the probability of an increase at just 30%.
This would indicate a drop in the stock market if the Fed raises the interest rate, unless the policy makers would soften the blow by promising that it would be a long time before the next rate increase.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The advance was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will keep the interest rate steady this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising for the Fed to raise interest rates at this point", Lonski said.
If Fed policymakers did this, they would have to act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in financial markets.
Other experts have stated that an interest rate hike would calm financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed poised to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, the first step toward a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expected an interest rate increase this year despite objections from liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job growth slowed in August, labour market growth has been solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed considers total employment.
Wage gains showed signs of growth.
And while inflation continued to fall short of the central bank's annual target, Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of plummeting oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the strain on the labour market", said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to spin late this month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16% below its all-time high in May as investors feared that the slowdown in the Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market has receded somewhat this month, with the Dow now about 10% below its May high.
For Fed decision makers, market turmoil adds to the complex calculation of the timing of an interest rate hike.
"Without what's happened in the financial markets and the news of the weakening Chinese economy in recent weeks, it would have been more firmly in place", said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now, he's projecting they'll wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact on the US economy and there is almost no data to back up the events in China", Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the Fed's major interests, so it practically shouldn't be considered in decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been huge.
The mere hint by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might "swallow" its monetary expansion triggered a worldwide market earthquake.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, Fed officials are expected to not only monitor developments in other areas, but also consult with other central banks and experts to better understand the global economy.
Its decision-making is 'more art than science', said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at the wealth management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that "The Fed has a history of overreacting to changes in financial markets that seem to have no bearing on economic fundamentals".
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making body that supported the interest rate hike, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
A financial crisis that affected Asia prompted the Fed to cut the benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "despite limited identifiable implications for US development", Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed those declines.
The Fed should put financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee.
The recent turbulent period is nowhere near that level, he said.
'We certainly don't want to be in a situation where we fear a rise in interest rates because the markets are upset,' said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in that regard, I don't think it should take premature action.
Looking for a fabulous market with Thai specifics?
Try LAX-C from Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse opened in 1997 is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often called Thai Costco, LAX-C is a Thai wholesale market that sells to the public.
Yeah, it's in Chinatown and not Thai Town.
The market/warehouse is a one-stop shop offering a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dehydrated products, Thai and Asian folk snacks and kitchenware, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
There's also an auto rack where you have to buy some motor oil.
The store is huge and it takes at least an hour to walk through all the aisles.
If you get hungry from all that buying, eat at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The interior food section of the store (good, affordable) is close to home and offers several options for take-out meals.
What's in store: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
Probably found at LAX-C.
The products are reasonably priced and some items are sold in bulk.
Fresh produce includes herbs, fruits and other Asian and Thai products.
The meat section is large, and so is the fish section - the staff will clean and filet the fish and even fry it for you if you wish.
A large part of the store is devoted to the huge freezer section, where you will find curry leaves, frozen melon and ginger, whole ducks, fish, blood and beef balls, pig carcasses, fish meat, traditional sausages, semi-prepared and many more.
Who buys there: Restaurant owners and chefs, as well as families and individuals.
The wide walkways are suitable for both shopping carts and forklift trucks.
Fresh durian fruit just outside the houses.
Location: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own shared parking area with other shops and restaurants.
Although the store is likely to be crowded, parking is usually not difficult to find.
Seven's Sunrise is dominating the polls, despite attempts by Nine to broadcast the Today Show's leadership change.
The urgent move of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to broadcast on the consequences of the Liberal Party leadership changes did not bring a significant increase in viewership for Today.
Channel Nine's morning show was broadcast from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat to Malcolm Turnbull.
The rival show Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was picked up in London as part of a series of broadcasts over the course of several weeks, which also included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This "crossover" didn't seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers, with Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, versus Today with 339,000.
Today saw a slight increase compared to Monday's 317,000 and last Tuesday's 283,000, but the numbers were lower than last Thursday's 343,000.
Today has narrowed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000.
Right now, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
This morning, it's not just Parliament that is affected by the current of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

The main news was the stunning debut of the 800 Words series starring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average viewership of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics have questioned whether Thomson is capable of running a show on his own without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The audience scores for last night were a resounding "yes".
The X Factor show on Seven held on to its position with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded highs and lows on the second night that it aired The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new general culture show moderated by Andrew O'Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) climbed to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 and the second half recorded a huge 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The drop in the Chase Australia record audience on the second night will give the Nine tacit confidence that the Hot Seat will finally triumph at 5:30.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested at gunpoint at an airport in Siberia.
Because of his open defiance of President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was condemned, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated, and his pro-democracy efforts were undermined.
Four people have lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred late Tuesday in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district police chief, over 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, some of them throwing stones and Molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal stated that the police forces used tear gas and then fired in the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are typically used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests have also been held in western Nepal, where the ethnic group Tharus wants their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in the violent clashes on 10 August,
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces -- a major step toward a new constitution but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, a country that has been centrally governed for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution was started in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week in Kathmandu, lawmakers voted on the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We will not use wire fences, dogs, policemen and guns
The Prime Minister continues to exchange replies with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the Government meeting on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania's firm position on the refugee crisis.
We are making every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all the institutions have a coordinated view.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, barbed wire fences or armed police.
"It is a disgrace for 21st century Europe to apply methods from the 1930s", declared Victor Ponta
"The Prime Minister also said that all the dates and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and settled in the CSAT meeting on Thursday". the Prime Minister concluded.
NHC announces 60% chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A broad low-pressure front about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60% chance of becoming a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low pressure front about halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles also presents a 60% chance of tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, the Miami-based meteorologist added.
Weight-loss surgery may be helpful for mildly obese diabetics
The benefits of weight-loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes could be sustained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still too early to say whether diabetics with mild obesity live longer after weight-loss surgery than those who undergo nonsurgical treatments.
'It takes a long time to centralise mortality data', said Dr Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, who wrote a paper on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss surgeries, also called bariatric surgery, use various methods to shrink the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been in people who are morbidly obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is considered normal in the range 18.5-24.9.
A BMI of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by going to: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The mean BMI in people who had surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of people who received nonsurgical treatment for diabetes remained about the same, namely 29.
Of those who had surgery, 36 percent had their diabetes completely and 28 percent had it partially cured.
In the medically treated group, by comparison, only 1% of the subjects had their diabetes completely and only 2% had a partial cure.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and LDL " bad " cholesterol were generally better in the surgery group, the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored the blood level of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
The researchers write that the optimum hemoglobin A1c level is below 7%.
After surgery, the mean hemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
But in the medically treated group, it remained at about 8 percent.
But this improved glycemic control - reflected by improved hemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce the five-year mortality rate, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average outcomes associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared with the arm gastrectomy group, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), had more substantial decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and had a higher likelihood of complete diabetes remission (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
Although our study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona, School of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were about 29% less likely to die after 15 years, compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients who had surgery, Blackstone said it was an optimistic prospect for people with a BMI under 35 interested in the procedure.
This is where this paper is critical, as it states that this surgery is safe in the low BMI group, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start to take weight seriously when a patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
"I think we are waiting too long to encourage people to take this seriously", she said.
I think once they've accumulated these genetic changes that have short-circuited their bodies and predisposed them to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely difficult to get back to normal.
It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not take all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lay in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has issued a call to end the violence in the refugee mother countries.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current refugee crisis in his opening speech at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethical studies, at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that in the present situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of every nation and even every continent.
He also stressed that, while admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
'It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe', he said in his speech.
While the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to care for a few thousand refugees, but we must also think about long-term solutions to bring peace and sincere development, especially through education, in Muslim countries", he stressed.
After all, we have to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
Force has never solved these problems, he added.
On the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, stating that the violent response from the US has generated an uncontrollable chain of events.
After the events of September 11, I sent a letter of condolence to President Bush and told him to solve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong, but he used force and it produced unintended consequences", the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in children ingesting hand sanitizer in the last four years
According to the Georgia Poison Control Center, U.S. poison control centers have reported an increase of about 400% since 2010 in the number of children under 12 years of age who have ingested high-alcohol hand sanitizer.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Control Center, cases of ingestion of hand sanitizer in children under 12 years old reported to the poison control centers went from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children have more frequent access to these products, and unfortunately, a percentage of them end up in the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some kids drink detergent intentionally and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to social media challenges.
You can watch videos on YouTube of teenagers drinking detergent to create cheap drinks.
Apparently, teenagers mixed the detergent with the mouthwash with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive smell of detergent.
"A child doesn't think that it hurts him", says Lopez.
Many of the most attractive types are the scented ones.
Hand sanitizers with strawberry, grape, orange flavors are the most appealing to children.
Hand detergent contains approximately 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, just a few sips can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's very concentrated alcohol", Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-poisoning center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 of Kansas City.
So we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand sanitizers in accessible places, and if the little ones get to them, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested the equivalent of four sprays of strawberry-flavored hand sanitizer at school, was rushed to the emergency room for treatment.
She had a blood alcohol level of 179, twice the legal threshold for an adult to be under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, the emergency room physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah was limping and unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain damage, as the girl had fallen and hit her head due to alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was terrifying", Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez recommended parents and teachers use non-alcoholic wet wipes or products and keep hand sanitizer out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after ingesting hand sanitizer that contained an undeclared, toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in upstate New York plotted to poison their teacher "by placing antibacterial products in the classroom", according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand sanitizer and has banned it from her classroom.
The police considered the plan to be "insignificant" and referred the disciplinary issue to the school inspectorate.

Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football supporters have lost interest in Celtic - because they are not fighting for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, now Ajax's ambassador, said: "In the Netherlands, they no longer broadcast the Celtic game summaries; why?"
Because the Rangers aren't there.
This isn't just about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Firm.
There's talk of both teams together and there's interest.
The tension is high in the Old Firm matches and it's not just the Scots who want to see these matches.
I will change the situation, promise Deila.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic are fighting hard but the Norwegian boss has promised to turn the tide.
Defeat to Malmo and subsequent elimination from the Champions League was followed by defeat to the 10-man Aberdeen, now top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila stated: "The Celtic have had periods before and they will come back".
We want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are extremely angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel the same way - but we need to go further.
We really need the Celtic support because it makes the players better.
It's extremely important that we stay united now.
Warburton's caution with regard to January transfers
Despite comments just weeks ago suggesting that he had identified a few targets for the January transfer window, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not want to affect Ibrox's team unity.
The former Brentford boss said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer transfer window".
With summer transfers, there is a pre-season period when they can be integrated, which you could have seen this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more damage if you bring in players you don't need.
Celtic targeting Michu after the withdrawal
Swansea striker Michu, who was linked with Celtic during the transfer window, has suggested he could retire at the end of his contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old struggled for two years with ankle problems and was unable to leave Wales for the summer.
Hearts facing the SFA over Neilson's comments
Hearts were leading 2-1 when Paterson was sent off and lost 3-2, but the defender's red card was then cancelled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance".
The Griffiths vow to avoid Tynecastle
The undefeated Hibee was taken in after admitting to singing an offensive song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014, in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before a derby against Edinburgh at Tynecastle.
'It was the derby and it was the excitement of the moment', said the striker, adding: 'Needless to say, I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic.'
Tannadice Council has confidence in Dundee United management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's board still trusts the management team to turn things around - but agrees that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We'll get the boys back in shape, Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for the dirty victory against Hamilton
Derek McInnes acknowledges that the Aberdeen team must desperately hang on to Hamilton Accies for their seventh successive league win, which brought them five points ahead of Celtic thanks to a penalty shot in the first inning by Adam Rooney.
McInnes stated: There is no team that has won anything, in the cup or league, that has not won games like that.
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while in the UK it is rising
THE unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged at 164,000 in May-July, while the number of unemployed in the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9% was higher than that of the UK, at 5.5%, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland fell by 12,000 in the three-month period, with the number of people currently employed at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in the quarter to 74.0% - a figure above the UK average of 73.5.
Commenting on the latest figures, Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell said: 'The authorities' long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy'.
It's been almost exactly one year since Scotland made its historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In the last 12 months, we've seen improvements in the Scottish labour market, with the employment rate rising and the unemployment rate falling.
Why am I witnessing an execution in Oklahoma?
During the course of today, barring any belated legal intervention, I will watch as a man is sentenced to death.
If it does, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in a viewing room in the execution room of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary and I'll be watching Richard Glossip be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation first came in January, through his best friend, and, though I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day of the trial draws near, I'm terrified of the idea.
So why would I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It's true, journalists can witness executions in America, and because there are usually more requests than there are seats, a macabre lottery is held to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
The chosen will watch the execution impartially.
I can't do that. I'm not going to do that.
I would sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, plus I developed my own connection with him over months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to carry a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist in Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants it, get access.
I complained to her.
He admitted that he could have said it better, but he still thinks I'm wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it even if you asked me to.
I told him he could take me off the witness list anytime.
But he wants to have an international report written about it.
He thinks that if he dies, the publicity will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be joining me.
If you want to learn more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files that I've made.
I will not go into all the details here.
I can't say for certain that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very possible he's not guilty of murder.
I believe with certainty that there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from this perspective.
I can't pretend to be totally objective.
For that, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From me you will learn what it is to watch a man you like die needlessly.
Peter Moody claims the stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to pull out of the race
Peter Moody has claimed that the stewards of Racing Victoria or tried to infiltrate a spy at his stables last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from racing.
He launched an attack on the stewards and integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they were running a personal campaign against him, the straw that broke the camel's back being the removal of Lady Tatai from the race due to a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what's best for the racing field and that he's put in a tough spot when it comes to Lidari's positive cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words of statements about spies and did not want to resemble the fox that does not reach the grapes.
"I wasn't going to say anything about that and I kept quiet for a long time but sometimes you get to a level of frustration that is so high that everything just goes off", Moody said.
It's known to have continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
Tonight I will go home and sleep peacefully.
I want to go above and beyond and I want the owners I work with to see that I'm trying to give them the best of me.
The moment they start to think that's not happening, I have to quit coaching.
At that point I'll have to figure out what to do with my certification.
Earlier, Moody threw the bomb in an interview with racing.com where he stated that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stables.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were in a room with a man - whose name I'll give if I'm asked - and they offered to hire him at my stables to provide information on the activity there", Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously, she thinks I'm a cheat.
If so, then you should all resign because you were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL and Bernard Saundry, executive director and current CEO of RVL, knew it then and know it today.
Am I supposed to think this is personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having a backbone and can it hold people outside of the trainers accountable for what's happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on the industry that bad?
Maybe that's how the others see it.
Maybe I should have my license taken away and put me away, and I have no doubt that the statements I'm making now might cause him to consider that option.
But I've reached the point where I don't care anymore, and that makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on and I'll make them make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The trainer's frustration grew with the lengthy cobalt testing investigation that involved Lidari and the elimination led him to claim that he could "put his license on the table".
Moody, whose name is most often associated with training the undefeated champion Black Caviar, labelled the race day treatment rule as "ridiculous" after applying a mud or clay cataplasm to the horses' feet, which was a violation of the rules.
He's breaking the rules of the race.
I must take full responsibility for this", he says.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on his foot.
Could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which it did.
It happened on race day.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for race day treatment consisting of the cataplasm, for which the stewards have opened an investigation.
It's a joke. It's not funny.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand the need for rules, but it has gone too far", Moody said.
The driver who hit and ran from the scene of the accident in Cobram has been arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend, followed by a hit-and-run.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, having been seriously injured after being struck by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police officials say the driver of the motor vehicle did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a man in his 50s turned himself in to Shepparton police.
It seems he's gonna be charged with leaving the scene of an accident, failure to provide first aid and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is responding to his opponents in the wrestling charges.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called criticism of his team's placing tactics "denatured subjects" brought into the conversation by the NRL's top two favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees had allowed Storm players to take the team to the net in the match won by the Storm nervously in the qualifying final played Friday night in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a slight reference to the Storm after his team's victory in the qualifying match against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the match a "rugby league demonstration" and said that the two Queensland teams were not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped to the defense of the tackling tactics his team had, and stated that the players were simply focusing on "contact" when they were tackling.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two top coaches criticized his team, which means they were worried Storm would beat them.
And things don't stop there - we didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us 24-2", Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, except that in the last six weeks we've really put the emphasis on contact in the plateaus and that's how we've changed the situation.
Trent has been in this position for three years and obviously has a great team so probably he's not used to losing and it was a shock for him.
Funny how it always happens this time of year.
Bellamy countered Bennett's idea of "animating football" by reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "complicator football".
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He argued his case by comparing his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and talked about how exciting the game was, Bellamy said.
I remember back in 2010, St George got a lot of criticism for being a boring team and Wayne said he wasn't interested in black under his fingernails.
But now he has a team that can play what we would consider to be exciting football, especially because of the young, fast midfielders.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have players like that.
He made that argument in 2010, and now he wants everyone to adopt his style of play -- not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they're saying these things because they're somewhat concerned about the match with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they thought about the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the Storm-Roosters game was a more scoreless contest compared to the Broncos-Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, what was the score?
Our game ended 20-18, our game had two more tries, that's exciting play?
Or is thrilling about pausing and not marking?
For me, they're plans.
If they're talking about us, it means that we might meet them at some point.
The Storm have the weekend off as they have earned the right to play at home against either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the pre-season final next Saturday at AAMI Park, with tickets going on sale starting next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girls' phones to entice pedophiles to send him pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to request pictures of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was asleep and then logged into an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images featuring children.
The girl later woke up and noticed the phone was missing, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was asleep.
She looked in her phone and found the disturbing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
After arriving, police viewed the five photos then analyzed computers found at the address and found "worrying" Internet searches using terms to find indecent images of children.
Hogg claimed he did it to attract pedophiles to the Internet before pretending to be a cop to scare them off.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee court: "He said he was an addict - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches but said that he did it because he wanted to pose as a policeman to scare off the pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with the unknown person who sent him the images and about asking the unknown person to send him more pictures.
He said he did it to warn you.
He said he couldn't think straight when he drank and he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Mr Robertson added: "When the little girl found the messages on her phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the accused was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did.
On 14 June last, Hogg, aged 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges of making or taking indecent photographs of children, and breaching the conditions of his probation on 25 January this year and failing to appear in court on 24 March this year.
The defense attorney, Gregor Sim, has asked that Hogg not be entered on the sex offender registry because it can be said that this crime "did not involve a significant sexual aspect".
Judge Alistair Carmichael has postponed sentencing until October, due to social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in that case but remained in custody pending hearings for other cases.
He was put on the sex offender registry before he was sentenced.
Robert Mugabe, the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
Earlier this year, Mr. Mugabe, Africa's longest-serving leader, fell down a flight of stairs.
He was not hurt, but the video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who claimed they had received anonymous death threats, threatening them not to boo Mr. Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they booed him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the parliamentary group Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent from a hidden number but it is titled 'moarte'", he told reporters after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the MPs concerned that immunity only applies in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity has no value.
The parliamentary group leader said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about the threats being sent to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard is going to make 30,000 layoffs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 layoffs as part of the company's efforts to restructure and reduce costs in the services sector.
This year, HP will split on the stock exchange into two companies, separating its computer and printer business from its fast-growing corporate hardware and services business.
The expected disposals will cost about $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said.
These restructurings will give the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and cost-effective structure, said Meg Whitman, HP's president and CEO, who will lead the unit after the split.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than HP is at present and will have a broad portfolio of businesses that will help companies transition to the new business style, said Whitman.
By operating as a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing demands of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and will focus on providing unrivalled integrated solutions to businesses.
The company was founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, whose business was the production of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called the "Silicon Valley league".
HP has gone through a massive reorganization to adapt to the shift from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world's second largest computer maker and one of the largest technology companies in the US, is the latest in a long line of measures based on the idea that firms that focus their attention better in one direction perform better.
FriendsFest: the comedy series that taught us important lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men reaching a 15-year high.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death for men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the issue, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, wanting to question the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to succeed in this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students who had symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends with a healthy mood, his or her chances of recovery double.
Similarly, for people who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends reduces the likelihood of developing a mental disorder by half.
Of course, for friendship to work, it must first be accessible.
In this age of communication dominated by social networks, where the emphasis is on style rather than substance, the immediacy of the response often takes precedence over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled down on the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even though in reality isolation is the dominant one.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values -- our inner desire for personal growth and friendship -- that affect our mental health even more profoundly.
The billionaire video game inventor recently explained that money really can't buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that it brought that idea to the forefront.
The characters were not defined by their workplace but by their own personalities, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments of watching football in their comfy armchairs, and Ross' passion for Rachel came from the fact that men are known to associate with this situation, even though they often shy away from fully exploring their feelings.
As a social worker explained to me, "My role of listening to suicidal and depressed people has shown me how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference".
Often, the people who come to us don't feel able to talk to their friends.
The old saying about doing it yourself is powerful, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of those shows that comes to my mind when I'm trying to offer more mechanisms of long-term psychological adaptation.
The show highlighted small moments of male friendship.
As much as objective, outside intervention over the phone helps people in moments of desperation, the long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So if you're attending this weekend's FriendsFest hosted by Comedy Central, with the set-up complete to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends over for coffee at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in a Starbucks, smile and wave.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends is on Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - on the occasion of #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG to put Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates alongside Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on Tuesday in his Champions League debut and helped PSG to win against Swedish side Malmo.
Here's the game's story and reaction to it.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their homework, as Paris Saint-Germain started the Champions League group stage with a 2-0 win over Malmo in the match played on Tuesday at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut for PSG, bringing the French champions to the advantage despite missing a number of chances before securing the lead with Cavani's 61st-minute goal.
Having reached Group A alongside Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as the French team's objective is not only qualifying in the last eight but also improving their run to the quarter-finals in each of the last three tournaments.
But despite taking the points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic squandering the goal opportunity after which he was replaced by his hometown team and the club where he began his illustrious career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win is a problem for our opponents and a comfortable margin against the bottom, even if there are still aspects we need to improve throughout the season", Blanc said.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I'm sorry we couldn't score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury in one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 draw at home to Bordeaux in Ligue 1 over the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentinian attacking midfielder was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe and he proved this when he snapped at Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmo's defence before shooting incredibly over Johan Wiland, into the long right-hand corner of the gate.
But if anyone expected PSG to win the game with a snap of their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with nine starters at the national teams, with a five-man defence and two defensive midfielders, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except for the shot of Nikola Djurdjic who passed Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players slowed down a few times, giving some useless passes and not finishing the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five attempts in the first half alone and was then replaced by Cavani right after the game resumed.
Ibrahimovic proved to be more adept at supporting his teammates, with his pass being the one that Di Maria sent in a shot deviated by Wiland over the goal in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was scored in a final after an hour of play, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's centre.
This goal eliminated Malmo's hopes of rebalancing the score and only a superb stop by Wiland from the distance for the repulsion David Luiz kept the final score before newcomer Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal in extra time was annulled.
The Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later stated that PSG were a class above and that "The last match I played in the Champions League was in December last year".
Since then, I've only played in the league in Sweden, which doesn't rise to the same level.
The qualifications are not enough.
Hats off to PSG.
They played a great game.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion from stock sales
Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by the fall in stock prices on the commodities market, raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a massive debt reduction plan.
Glencore, a London-listed company, said it had sold £1.6 billion of new shares to pay off debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company is taking a hit from plummeting commodity prices as China's slowing economic activity squeezes demand and wreaks havoc on markets.
The preferential subscription increased the price of Glencore's shares on the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday morning trading.
Shares rose by 2,77% to 131,60 shillings on the FTSE 100, which opened at a value of 0,69% higher.
Glencore disclosed the sale of $2.5 billion of shares as part of broader plans to cover nearly a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at 125 shillings per share, 2.4% below Tuesday's closing price.
He divested 1.3 billion shares, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concern over the prolonged slowdown in the Chinese economy led to a substantial increase in iron ore prices by around half, and coal, copper and other commodity prices fell by 20-40%.
Xi urges wider expansion of global economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reform group that the economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth.
China must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve opening-up policies, Xi said at the 16th Meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting openness and encouraging reform will bring new impetus and vitality and make room for economic growth, Xi said.
The group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list regulating market access, relaxing customs control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital, and reorganizing the system of registration of residents.
According to the declaration, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and areas of activity in which investment is not permitted.
The system will be tested gradually and improved through test programmes.
According to the statement, the measure is important as it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a law-based business environment and providing a wider opening of the market.
The state authorities will also loosen the controls on the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to run their businesses.
China will also allow border regions to explore new patterns of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth, according to the statement.
In an attempt to open up the state-controlled sectors, more sectors will be opened up to private investment.
The state authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of companies established from foreign investments and provide them with better services, according to the statement.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign nationals to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called 'green cards', streamlining requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the right of lawyers to practice and the education of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions, unhappy with the Government's proposal to increase salaries by 10%
Negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the unions in Education have not come to any result, the Government proposing a 10% salary increase from 1 December, with pay on 1 January 2016, and the unions wanted a 15% increase from November, or a 20% increase from December.
The talks took place at Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the Prime Minister being accompanied by the Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, the Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and the Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
The government's proposal today did not please us, otherwise we would not have been in a position to convene the heads of our federations.
The 10 percent we were promised today is less than we expected.
"In fact, this 10 percent is the money we have stipulated in our agreement with the Government, last year, for 2016", said Anton Hadar, president of Alma Mater, at the end of the discussions.
Point: In the future, health and education are the areas where we'll invest all the money we have.
According to him, on Thursday, a meeting of the FSLI will take place in which government representatives will also participate to present the proposal for a wage increase to the representatives of the country's confederations, after which the trade unionists will decide whether to accept the Executive's offer.
The Prime Minister also told the trade unionists that the Government is trying to send the Wage Law to Parliament as soon as possible so that it can come into force on December 1st.
The legislative act provides for an increase in salaries in the education system by 25% of the total increase of 70%, which is to be phased in over the next four years.
Victor Ponta also promised the trade unionists the acquittal of all judges sentences in 2016.
The migrant crisis: a tragedy in the Aegean
At least 22 migrants drowned Tuesday in Turkish territorial waters after their boat capsized.
Among the victims are 11 women and five children, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and was heading for the Greek island of Kos.
The Turkish coast guard said they managed to rescue 249 people from the shipwreck, but their nationality is still unknown.
Earlier this month, two other people died while attempting to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also over the weekend, 34 migrants, including four babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisi, 15 kilometres from the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat was carrying more people than its capacity, so it sank.
The route has become a popular one in recent years for migrants seeking to escape war and hard living in countries like Syria and Iraq.
Over 100 stewardesses fired for being too fat
Air India is laying off about 130 flight attendants for being overweight, the company announced late last week.
The state-owned company said the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the move is "ridiculous" and "shockingly sexist", writes The Washington Post.
The mass layoff is the latest in a ten-year battle between the company and the more plump stewardesses.
Weight limit for these dates back to the 1980s, when Air India started using ideal weight and height charts.
In 2006, Air India fired nine stewardesses deemed "exceptionally overweight" as this "may have had an effect on reflexes and may impede the agility required to perform emergency measures".
The stewardesses sued the company, won, and were rehired, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to weaken them have failed", a company spokesman explained.
A footballer from the Star gives lessons to Gigi Becali: What decision he made
A football player from Steaua is giving lessons to Gigi Becali in terms of promoting young players.
If the champion's financier decided to close the football academy in which he had invested a considerable sum, the defender Paul Papp opened a football school.
The Paul Papp Academy will be held in Dej, and the local children are expected to take part in the first selection.
I'm extremely happy that I've reached this stage, to give the start to the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it's extremely important to find talented kids who can play football without worrying about training materials.
They have to be concerned with one thing: playing football as well as possible.
The technical details shouldn't be their concern.
They have to value their talent.
This is what Paul Papp's Football Academy wants to do.
"I'm waiting for Mayor Costan Morar to be the first choice of the children, to show them that he is with them", Papp told the dejanul.ro.
The Star Academy is open to children up to the age of 11.
The whole party wants to govern.
The interim president of the PSD Liviu Dragnea said on Tuesday that the whole party wants to remain in government, and if the prime minister wants, this decision will be formalized at the PSD Congress.
I understand that Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to govern, the whole party.
If it wants to be formalized by an act of Congress, we will do that.
There's not gonna be any emotion about it.
"There have been no elements, no voices in the party, no opinions in the party that give anyone the impression that the PSD does not want to remain in government, in the current government, with the current prime minister", Dragnea said at the end of the PSD Permanent National Bureau meeting.
PSD has announced when it will hold its congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Tuesday that it is important that at the PSD Congress, beyond the election of the leadership, a clear message is given whether the party wants to continue in government or if the party decides to go into opposition.
I'll announce on Monday if I'll run for a congressional seat
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday whether he will run for a leadership position in the next Congress.
I'll sing on Monday, after the Executive Committee, if the date of the congress is set.
"I will announce if I will run for a position in the party leadership", Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday's meeting of the PSD's Permanent National Bureau.
Asked if the hesitation about announcing his candidacy is related to his file, Dragnea said he doesn't have that problem.
I don't have the issue you're referring to, but it seems fair and honest to all my party colleagues to announce whether or not I'm a candidate when the date of the Congress is formally set.
"That's the only motivation", Dragnea said.
The vast majority of the Social Democratic branches have proposed an extraordinary PSD Congress on October 11, and the exact date of the Congress will be decided by the Executive Committee of the party on Monday.

An Italian was caught at Bors customs with immigrants hidden in the TIR
Two Sri Lankans were spotted on Monday at Bors Customs while trying to cross the border illegally, hidden in the back of a car driven by an Italian national.
Investigations revealed that the two paid the driver 4,000 euros to be transported to France, the Border Police informs.
During the specific check, the border police officers noticed a large travel bag in the cabin of the truck, containing personal belongings for several people, which is why they carried out a thorough check of the means of transport.
On this occasion, border police discovered, hidden in the semiremerka of the automaker, among the plastic cans, two male persons.
The verification revealed that the persons in question, two men, aged 28, are citizens of Sri Lanka and asylum seekers in Romania.
"The young people told investigators that they intended to go to France, so they contacted a national, through whom they met with the Italian driver, who offered to take them to their destination, where they would receive 2,000 euros per person", the Border Police statement said.
The two migrants were charged with "criminal offences under the heading of attempted fraudulent crossing of the state border".
Also, Pompeo B., the 45-year-old Italian citizen who was driving a Renault Magnum car registered in Romania, transporting plastic boxes for an Italian company, was detained for 24 hours, to be presented to the Bihor Tribunal with a proposal for preventive arrest.
How satisfied are Romani couples: Men versus women
Most Romans are content with their relationships.
This is the conclusion of a study carried out on the occasion of the visit to Romania by John Gray, the famous author of the bestseller "Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus".
A total of 62% of respondents said they were 'very satisfied' and 'satisfied' with the overall quality of their relationship.
"However, 18% report being 'slightly dissatisfied' and 'very dissatisfied' in their relationship, and another 18% say 'properly'", the study concluded, according to a statement provided Tuesday to Ziare.com.
The situation is slightly different when the responses of men and women are analyzed separately.
So 28% of men are very satisfied, 39% are satisfied, 17% are satisfied, 6% are very dissatisfied and 8% are slightly dissatisfied.
As for women, 33% said they were satisfied, 24% very satisfied, 8% very dissatisfied, 14% slightly dissatisfied and 19% chose the right category.
When we look at the degree of satisfaction, we see that men are more satisfied.
As far as the neutral state is concerned, we see a difference of two percent.
"The same is true for the very dissatisfied situation, with the biggest difference being the slightly dissatisfied response, where we see a difference of 6 percent", the statement said.
The study also showed that a quarter of Romans (26%) spend an hour or less together, 18% spend between five and eight hours together, and 45% between two and four hours.
The authors of the study also report that "Romans feel that they need a little more adventure in their life (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), security (20%), novelty (19%), sex (19%), respect 18%, trust 17%, pleasure 17%, connection 17%, knowledge 16%, protection 14%, importance 14%, learning 12%, freedom 11%, self-knowledge 10% and control 7%".
The study was conducted by Extreme Training between June 1 and September 1 on 1,369 people, with a calculated margin of error of 2.6%.
Europe has been shamed once again.
German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said Tuesday that Europe has "made a mockery of itself" after the failure of Monday's Brussels ministerial meeting on the distribution of refugees within the European Union.
"Tonight (Monday) Europe was once again shamed", said Sigmar Gabriel, who is also Chancellor Angela Merkel's economy minister, at a press conference.
Earlier, the German Interior Minister, Thomas de Maiziere, suggested reducing the European Union's structural funds for countries that reject refugee quotas.
European interior ministers, meeting in Brussels on an emergency Monday, failed to agree on the mandatory relocation of 120,000 refugees, requested last week by the European Commission to deal with one of the worst migration crises in Europe since 1945.

Thousands of people passed by the coffin with the lifeless body of Cornelius Vadim Tudor, so many people were not at St. George's Church but at the re-sanctification of the shrine at the Great Shrine of St. Nicholas, said, on Wednesday, the parish priest Emil Caramizaru.
Hundreds of people of all ages line up, stretching from the church entrance to the side streets, to pass the catafalque that holds the coffin of the lifeless body of Cornelius Vadim Tudor.

The parish priest insisted that Vadim Tudor often came to this church, especially in the evening, after 8 pm, and then asked him to open the racle with the monastery of St. Nicholas and it remained to pray for a minute in a row.
He came here very often, usually in the evening, after 8:00 he would ask me to open his rack with the relics of Saint Nicholas and pray.
He said it was a great blessing this church of Brancoveanu.

What 's going on with Coach Darren Cahill ?
Simona Halep is facing a crucial decision in her career, as she must decide whether or not to continue working with coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked together this year on the Adidas Player Development program, with the Australian technician only joining the Romance at the big tournaments.
Simona had nothing but praise for Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who's managed to hold his own against the capricious sportswoman.
But Adidas's program is set to expire at the end of this year, and Halep has to decide whether to offer Cahill a consistent contract or whether to drop the partnership.
We don't know exactly what's going to happen yet.
We talk and see.
"After Singapore I will be able to give an answer", Simona confessed at a press conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in tennis today, he's asking for a contract of about a million dollars a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a job he would not want to give up at this time.
The last event Simona and Cahill will be working on together is the Tournament of Champions, in Singapore.
I was not normal, I was not respected
Victor Piturca revealed how he parted ways with the Romanian national team last fall.
The former coach confessed that he did not get along with the FRF president, Razvan Burleanu, after he took his place to Mircea Sandu, and thus made the decision to leave the national team.
Finally, he proposed to the head of the Federation to increase his salary substantially to stay, but was refused.
At this point, I'm not sorry I left the Nationals.
I was sorry then, leaving a job behind.
I thought it was good for me then, and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selector, it was not normal, I was not respected, I was not respected work.
We worked well with the previous ones at the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he found out different opinions from the press about me.
It didn't change me because it was very hard at the time, with the results we had, plus the financial situation in the middle.
We kept working, everything went very well and he probably changed his mind too.
But I wanted to go.
If they wanted me to stay, I offered them a contract extension.
We have about 400 and a few thousand euros a year, I'm going to have about 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, I talked to his right hand man.
"He agreed, but only if we finish first in the group", Victor Piturca told Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from the Romanian national team last autumn, despite the team's strong performance in the Euro 2016 qualifiers.
The technician accepted the offer to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately taking over the Al Ittihad group.
Armor and water cannons at the border
Hungarian police detained Humvee military vehicles equipped with machine guns on the border with Serbia, after violent clashes on Wednesday, when water cannons and tear gas were used against migrants who wanted to enter from Serbia, despite the fact that Hungary had erected a barbed wire fence.
At least 20 police officers and two children were injured in the clashes, Russia Today reports.
So far 20 policemen have been injured and the ambulance service has picked up two children who were injured after being thrown over the security fence.
"We will rebuild the fence and we will strengthen it and we will protect the security of Hungary by any means", said the Hungarian Prime Minister's security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi.
Police tried to control the crowd with water cannons and tear gas, throwing plastic bottles, rocks and pieces of pavement.
Authorities reported that several dozen migrants broke through the fence at the crossing between the towns of Roszke and Horgos and managed to enter the country.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has called on Serbia to take action against "very aggressive" migrants at the common border.
There are reports that the Serbs have also supplemented their border security forces.
Following Wednesday's incidents, Budapest has suspended the Roszke-Horgos border crossing for 30 days.
Hungary is in concerted action to close its borders to stem the flow of migrants.
If Tuesday announced that the wire fence at the border with Serbia will raise one at the border with Romania, to the vehement protests of Bucharest, on Wednesday, the Hungarian Prime Minister announced the erection of a fence at the border with Croatia.
The rare disease that a man suffers from
Nick Hess was an American banished by his family as an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was in a daze, he could barely stand and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old man said he had not consumed alcohol, he was clearly in a state of intoxication.
When she first accused me of being drunk, without having been drunk, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family thought 'maybe he drinks alone, he's a secret alcoholic'", he says, according to the Mirror.
When he saw the footage of his wife with him, the man from Columbus, Ohio, simply didn't recognize himself: "I was looking into my own eyes and I wasn't there".
'It was horrible, I couldn't remember anything.'
In addition, his wife, who, though she had doubted him for a while, eventually went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick's breath smelled like alcohol.
The most sobering moment for Nick was when, after a minor car accident, he was found to have a blood alcohol level three times the legal limit, even though the night before he had only had one beer.
After years and countless investigations, it was discovered that Nick suffered from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome".
Basically, his body is fermenting all the carbohydrates he consumes, turning them into alcohol.
The one who suspected that this might be Nick's disease was his own wife.
The disease has no cure yet, but since he gave up carbohydrates, Nick has had no such episodes.
He wrecked a Mercedes with a golf club
A South Korean man destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest of the services he had received from his dealer.
The man attacked his car with a golf club, causing enough damage to cause the car to be scrapped, reports BT.
The entire scene was filmed, and the video went viral on the Internet, much to the amusement of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car had defects that endangered his life and that of his family.
His anger was aroused when the dealer he had purchased the car from didn't solve the problem as he had agreed.
The government approved on Wednesday the "National Strategy on Immigration for the period 2015-2018" and the "Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "yet another stage that Romania is going through in the efforts to modernize the immigration management process on the national territory", according to a press release.
The source cited indicates that the strategy aims at the effective management of the migration phenomenon, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and directions for action reflecting the policies established at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by the States in Romania's immediate neighbourhood, measures are envisaged for the joint and coherent management of situations caused by the possible appearance of an influx of illegal immigrants on the territory of Romania, generated by crisis situations of a political, social, economic or military nature.
'The Romanian authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time, will pay special attention to citizens from states with potential migrationist or who may undermine national security,' adds the source.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including the continuation of the conflict in Syria, the revival of the conflict in Iraq, the maintenance of an unstable situation in the border areas with Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), and the perpetuation and intensification of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets some general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promotion of legal migration, stricter controls of the legality of the stay of third-country nationals on the territory of Romania and the proper application of removal and restrictive measures, improvement of the national asylum system.
The national strategy shall also include specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the overall strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access to the Romanian territory for third-country nationals who meet labour needs, facilitating access for third-country nationals to higher education institutions in Romania for fields and professions identified as lacking.
The Government considers the 2015 Action Plan to be "a means of setting out concrete activities leading to the creation of a flexible system to stop the growing migration phenomenon".
Romania, in a European top for the labour market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the highest increase in total labour costs among EU Member States in the second quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2014, according to data published on Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The index refers to the employer's personnel expenditure.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any evidence that the measures taken by the United States are in line with the principles of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
Romania, third in EU for labour cost growth
The highest increases were reported in Latvia (7,9%), Romania (7,7%), Bulgaria (6,8%), Estonia (5,5%) and Lithuania (4,3%).
The only EU countries where hourly labour costs fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (down 2.9%), Cyprus (down 1.2%) and Italy (down 0.4%).
The increase in labour costs in Romania in April-June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in the hourly labour cost in industry and services, by 7,9% and 7,6% respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania recorded an advance of 5,8% of the hourly cost of labour.
The report of the TVR management, rejected in the committee: Stelian Tanase is at risk of dismissal
The culture committees of the Parliament rejected on Wednesday the activity report of the Board of the Romanian Television Society for the year 2014.
17 MPs voted to reject the report, one against (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report shall be forwarded to the Permanent Bureaux assembled.
They'll decide, probably next week.
It will be debated at the next plenary.
"I think that given this situation it will be done relatively quickly", said the chairman of the Senate Committee on Culture, Georgica Severin.
He added that it was "common sense" that the TVR management should be present at this meeting, since no representative of the TVR management was present at the meeting of the Culture Committees.
It was only sensible to have the TVR leadership present because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was sent to the members of the CA last night, at about an hour, which we didn't know, but today, after the meeting of the Joint Bureaux, I personally sent a fax to the TVR management inviting her.
I think that the moment you are summoned, you being a salaried budget, paid from public taxes and you are summoned to a meeting of the commissions reunited even if you do not like living.
"Because it is your duty, you are in an institution subordinate to Parliament", Severin said after the meeting of the Parliament's Culture Committees.
He added that during the meeting the financial aspects of the institution were discussed on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
The debts we saw and we continued, came up with the idea that this year would have been up to date, but they were not paid from the historical ones.
"I remind you that it is not my fault or anyone else's fault that the banking and tax affairs have been lost, there are clear management problems", Severin said.
He added that after the activity report is rejected by the assembled plenary, there will be elections for a new Board of Trustees, and this will elect the Director General of the institution.
I don't know who will be nominated for this position.
Miracles will not happen.
It is important to make political decisions for this institution to function.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that there's gonna be a genius that's gonna be standing in line here and beating you.
I hope that the decision makers, the plenary of the Parliament, by their vote, will choose with much reason the people who will lead TVR.
They must be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you ask me what qualities he must have - good sense in his attitude towards employees because it is a mess of petitions that come from employees, employees, layoffs.
"When you get such referrals 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we are talking about the financial situation which is a disaster", concluded the chairman of the Senate Committee on Culture.
Although he did not appear in Parliament, TVR's President and CEO, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, in which he asked that Parliament consider a series of measures that could lead to the salvation and guaranteeing of the economic and political independence of public television, among them the indexation of the TV tax.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase asks, in addition to the indexation of the TV tax, for the amendment and completion of HG 978/2003 on the tax for the public television service, in order to update the provisions on technological changes to the present day, as well as to regulate the procedure for the control of the payment of the TV tax and the establishment of contraventions and the application of sanctions and penalties.
It also wants a provision to be made extending the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTv's agents for the collection of the TV fee, by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In its view, it is necessary to set a ceiling of 5% for the collection fee.
Stelian Tanase asks for the reduction of the VAT rate for the activities specific to the public television station and the contribution for the CNC from 15% to 3%, but also for the amendment of Law 41/1994, in the sense of the possibility of receiving budgetary/financial allocations for the purchase of licenses for major cultural and sports events - the World Football Championship, the Golden Spike, Eurovision.
He argues that SRTv will go into default in the coming months given that labor law obliges the employer to enforce court decisions, even if they are not final, and wage rights are honored with priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce the costs of staff and TV production.
"So travel and other cost-generating activities were reduced, a number of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and at the end of July the TVR News station was closed", says the letter from the TVR president.
Tanase feels that the dire financial situation cannot be remedied by his own efforts.
"Without the support of the state institutions - the Government, the Parliament, the Presidency - the Romanian television will sooner or later be unable to fulfil its public mission", the letter states.
The leadership of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Committee of Culture.
Vasile Blaga's son-in-law, sent to the court
Vasile Blaga's son-in-law, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to trial on Wednesday by the prosecutors of the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
He is accused of tax evasion in a case with damages of approximately 600,000 euros, under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on May 22nd.
He founded the security firm Axis Corporate Security SRL, together with his mother, in April 2009, a year after he married Vasile Blaga's daughter Agathe.
The investigation revealed that, in order to avoid paying taxes to the state budget, the representatives of a company specialised in security services had created an illegal circuit, made up of several commercial companies, through which fictitious transactions were revealed.
"In fact, the company's accounts would have recorded fictitious purchases of services that, in reality, were not provided, thus damaging the state budget by approximately EUR 600,000", the Romanian Police explained in a press release.
The Six have decided Sanmartean's fate.
The Al-Ittihad club's six have decided the fate of midfielder Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press is reporting that the split of Sanmartean from Ittihad is imminent, the entrepreneur Ladislau Boloni's agent, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says that this will not happen again.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays starter match by match and does it well.
The Seichi also realized that he was the best and that it would be wrong to give him up.
There was a way to bring in another player, a much better one, but it didn't work out.
"There were several talks, like the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing came out", Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu has been elected Vice President of the Court of Auditors
Parliament voted on Wednesday to appoint PSD Senator Ilie Plen Sarbu, the son-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes were recorded for and 108 against.
The vote was secret, by ballot.
The PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, Digi24 reports.
Moreover, the Liberals criticized the appointment of Sarbu to this position and announced that they would challenge it to the CCR, as he has a file at the DNA, but does not have the necessary training and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because his new position at the Court of Auditors does not allow him to make politics.
The PSD Senator will take the position of Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, left vacant after Ioan Anton was recalled, following a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found that he was called unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors:
As Bradley Cooper is set to play a chef in the upcoming film "Burnt", the actor has made a revelation his fans didn't expect.
In a recent interview, he stated that he grew up mostly in the kitchen: "I worked most of my life as a cook".
He revealed that he had worked in the kitchen since he was 15 years old, when he worked for a Greek restaurant, so that later, in college, he would continue on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother is of Italian origin, so his entire childhood was cooked with his Italian grandmother, reports ContactMusic.
Asked what his future plans were at the time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the type to make five-year plans, "not even two".
"It's not motivating for me to have a map", he said.
"I have dreams, things you'd laugh at if I told you", he said, adding that what he had wanted since childhood had come true.
But at the age of 40, the actor admitted that he sees himself directing in the near future, taking Clint Eastwood's model, who also took up directing at this age.
Ponta, accused of unchecked slander and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto strongly condemned on Wednesday morning the statements of Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta that the political leaders in Hungary are "nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, with his irrational statements, offends the whole of Hungary", the Hungarian Foreign Minister said in a statement.
Civilized European politicians do not speak such uncontrolled calumnies.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he has lost his support in Romania's internal politics", the Hungarian foreign minister added, according to MTI.
In a Facebook post on Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to draw attention to and sanction the behavior of senior Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union".
I don't want to respond to provocations from Hungarian government officials.
"They are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and to anti-Semitic attitudes, and to the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!" Ponta wrote on Facebook.
The Romanian Prime Minister added that he is a supporter of rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, saying that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Charm, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are political decision makers no better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which the respective refugees flee!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and above all in the superiority of European values - what we see in the last days in Hungary is in total contradiction with precisely these goals and values!" the head of the Romanian executive stressed.
Earlier on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta's remarks on Hungary's handling of the refugee crisis "mere lies", saying such statements were inappropriate for a 21st-century leader, according to MTI.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned on Tuesday that "extremist and lying remarks" of the Romanian Prime Minister were linked to the internal political crisis in Romania and said that Budapest expects an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto was referring to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I have said and always say is that I am against xenophobic talk, the idea of closing the borders, that all those who come are terrorists, are Middle Ages nonsense and I am totally opposed to this approach.
If we can take in more, we will, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people as people, not as our Hungarian neighbors treat them, with the bat and the insert.
"I don't agree with that", the head of the Romanian executive said at a press conference in Targu Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Budapest government has decided to start preparations on the ground for the extension of the fence it is building on the border with Serbia, to deal with a possible change of route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that Hungary's decision to build a border fence solves nothing in the refugee problem and "scouts Hungary out of Europe".
What is the connection between Osama bin Laden and the crane crash in Mecca
Saudi authorities have announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, owned by Osama bin Laden's family, is "partly responsible" for the crane crash on Friday in the Sea of Mosques in Mecca, which killed 107 people.
According to an investigative committee, the company did not "comply with safety standards", the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported, reports the BBC.
The company's executives have been banned from leaving the country pending the completion of the investigation into this case.
The firm will also be barred from new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of the former leader of the terrorist network Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is currently run by the former terrorist leader's brother, Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for four years to expand the Grand Mosque, to accommodate more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday night during a thunderstorm, when a crane, likely thrown off balance by strong gusts of wind, collapsed on the eastern side of the roof of the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
The accident left 107 people dead and nearly 400 injured.
How Hagi Shut Down the Protestors
Considered by many the greatest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled, after retiring from active, as a weak coach, who cannot be able to perform in the new position.
After unfortunate experiences at the national team, Steaua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at the Future Constanta, the team he patronizes.
Exactly one year after taking over the team, the King has shown that he is capable of turning a team that was struggling to save from relegation into a top team.
Thus, after one year, the future recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 wins, 11 draws and 11 losses.
The scoreboard is one of a top team, fighting at the European cups.
Things took an even better turn for Viitorul this season, as the team came second in Ligue 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in Liga 1, with 20 goals (on par with Astra), more than double that of Steaua.
On the other hand, even though he brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young players, and in the last period in the starting team there were names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club's policy has made Viitor a team to watch for teams from abroad, so Hagi sold this summer for 1.5 million euros - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Along with the Stars, Futura is the only profitable team in League One, according to the data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played like a small country so far.
It's a legitimate strategy, but after that you can't ask to be treated like the seventh EU country.
The big countries are coming up with solutions for the whole EU, says Cristian Ghinea, a member of the board of directors of the Romanian Centre for European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be turned into a fortress, and purely police means will not work in this crisis: "Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with".
But there are masses that have been set off and we can't turn back history.
Migration is a reality that we have to adapt to as best we can and adapt them to us.
In the opinion of Cristian Ghinea, we are in a very emotional moment, where politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After it passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was not adapted to the current situation".
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council that actually didn't solve anything?
It is clear that the President of the European Commission, in agreement with Donald Tusk, did not want to force a vote on the Council.
All the prognostications were that he would have the votes he needed.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the JHA applied the principle of unanimity and any state could block any decision.
Therefore, things have been very little integrated in the area of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure applies, where the EC takes the initiative, and the Council approves it with the votes of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes were real.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it's a sensitive issue, there were rejection reactions in Germany itself against Chancellor Merkel's opening-up policy and they didn't want to have a reaction in many countries like "the EU is sending migrants to our heads".
So they have postponed it, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave is creating a huge problem for the Schengen governance and we will probably see big changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory quotas weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just left to cool off?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of the external borders, which means a shift from the individual responsibility of the members who are at the external border of Schengen to the responsibility of the Community agencies.
The border of Greece with Turkey is also the border of Germany with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants gave the limits of the old Schengen system.
Maybe it'll give up the Dublin principle, which says that migrants are the responsibility of the first country they enter, because it's not sustainable.
If Greece is going to cave, you can't always say it's Greece's business.
It's a common problem.
Just because the problem is common, is a solution possible without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, mechanism of sharing the effort of receiving?
Nobody knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work, if they are reached.
Because there is one problem: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don't think European countries will take on migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
It's likely to end up in some sort of one-stop-shop in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications are processed.
They're working on solutions like this.
But the problem has no simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, there are countries with no experience at all, like Romania, where the migrant problem will fuel the xenophobic current.
What is certain is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just begun to leave for Europe.
One estimate says only 10% have made it, winter is hard to cross the Mediterranean, but we expect next year to have a wave maybe even bigger.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we'll get used to this problem, we'll stop looking at it as catastrophic from a media point of view.
Talk about countries with more or less experience.
Do you think there's any place that has really succeeded in integrating large groups from a non-European culture?
I look at the Maghreb in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I wouldn't go as far as to make a radical statement.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than other waves of migration, but that doesn't mean they don't integrate at all.
There's an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, in Germany, in Britain.
But pure police means won't work.
To create a fortified Europe is illusory.
We must work on the mechanisms of integration into European societies.
There's been some mistakes.
We have to be more demanding.
We ask these people to learn the language, to try to take over the values, to no longer stay with one foot in Europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of their family including through marriages of convenience.
But we have to separate the imminent problem of these people from the long-term problem of their integration.
Just because others have failed to integrate long-term doesn't mean we have to watch them drown in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we're doubting the quality of the values these people come with.
And if there's an intervention in Syria, which I don't think there will be, it doesn't mean that they'll rebuild the country overnight and you can take them back.
Until solutions appear, we see fortresses within Europe.
The borders are closed, walls are erected, border controls are reintroduced in the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as such no, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built pretty minimally and by setting the rules so that the pressure was too much on the countries where these migrants first set foot.
I mean, we're all free to roam, but we all have our own problems.
In the face of such a wave, it is impossible, because some countries do not cope.
When there are these waves of emotion, politicians want to look like they're doing something, but in the long run, it doesn't change much.
After the attacks in France, we don't have a much more draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we did last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that's setting in both directions.
And it's so unstable from week to week that you can't make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of bellicose statements from politicians at home under pressure to be manly.
And then, you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and public opinion is getting emotional.
After the public emotion passes, we'll go back to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that's not just for people, but for goods.
This is the real European single market.
And I don't think that Europeans will give up on this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules is another.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and that was not adapted to the current situation.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
Like a little country that thinks if you pull the hat over your eyes and plug your ears, the subject disappears.
Faced with the reality of the waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your small country problem.
We did, it's a legitimate strategy, but after that you can't ask to be treated like the seventh EU country.
You're not, you're not playing at the big country level.
The big countries come with solutions for the EU as a whole, good or bad, we're not discussing their quality.
As did Poland.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of Romanians for Schengen will drop very much.
President Iohannis says it's probably a good thing we're not in yet.
So we move from the desperation of the entrance to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is of course a risk if Romania and Bulgaria join Schengen that migrants will see us as the alternative route.
Which is not to say that there is no reason to stay in Schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that the external borders will become a common responsibility, there will be single rules for accepting migrants, single rules for deporting those who do not receive asylum, single rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved its attention to Syria in Ukraine no one died.
Is there a connection between the two outbreaks, a Russian game?
Russia is behaving like a frustrated power.
She thinks being a great power means she's gonna mess with the Americans and the Europeans.
In that sense, yes, there is a connection.
Without the Putin regime's military and financial efforts, the Assad regime would have probably collapsed long ago.
And it was good to collapse before its main opponent was the Islamic State.
For about two years, there was a struggle between the Assad regime and the secular and moderate Muslim militias, supported by the Gulf states and the West.
Then the Islamic State rose, and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia may have complicated things, but it cannot be part of the solution.
It creates outbreaks of instability and chaos that it cannot shut down.
But you're only powerful if you have solutions.
The off-side game is just a strategy to buy time.
Putin's probably waiting for offers to be made, for him to press the buttons to solve the situation.
The offers don't come because people aren't convinced that he can somehow solve the issues that he created.
But I don't agree with theories that these people are being eaten by an invisible hand.
Let's not make Little more powerful than he is.
What a button will soon appear
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the "Like" button, and now the social network is preparing for its opposite, "Dislike".
Mark Zuckerberg, the company's co-founder and CEO, announced on his Twitter account Tuesday that the button will be available soon, the New York Times blog post reports.
Zuckerberg said that the "Dislike" button will show a nuance of what a user feels rather than a simple option.
However, his announcement raised the issue that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wants to avoid the moments when someone posts a major life event on his account and someone else dislikes it.
Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long demanded to be able to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said that it's not very comfortable for people to "like" current events, such as the refugee crisis, or the death of a family member.
"You may not feel comfortable liking that post", the Facebook rep pointed out.
The new Facebook button was not well received by everyone.
"There is already enough hate on Facebook and social media", said Atiq Haneef of Afghanistan on the New York Times' Facebook page, where the article was posted.
"I'm going to hit the 'Dislike' button", he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist in Atlanta, has argued that there's nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, social media analyst at eMarketer, mentioned that it's hard to imagine that a single button can convey a complex array of negative emotions.
May, she says, is the American election season coming up, and the "dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees have entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary has accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a small fraction of the thousands who arrived en masse at its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi announced.
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing point and announcing that it would build a fence on its border with Romania, DPA recalls.
The measure drew a sharp reaction from Serbia.
Just yesterday they said they would seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to seek asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different", said Serbian Minister for Refugees Aleksandar Vulin.
Before the new immigration law was imposed, a record 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police said Monday.
Also, over 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially Germany.
The new county council headquarters is about to collapse.
Two manufacturers, insolvent
The massive investments made here in recent years to move the institution are about to collapse because they've been stopped several times.
Two major builders who worked here went bankrupt during the works.
The county council building on Vasile Alecsandri Street will fall down by itself.
The building's consolidation and re-functioning was supposed to have been completed a year and a half later, but the work was not even half finished.
The final stage in the building's epic was consumed last week, when the National Dispute Settlement Council (CNSC) rejected a complaint by the firm that wanted to take over the contract to carry out the technical design for the work that is still to be executed.
The original draft was drawn up by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the insolvency of the builder and the interruption of the works, negotiation procedures were started without the publication of a participation notice with Impex Romcatel, the firm was to update the technical project and then a new tender for the works was to be organised.
'The negotiations were not concluded by a contract, however, as the CJ considered that the proposed form would have disadvantaged the institution', summed up Răzvan Timofciuc, public relations representative at the CJ.
The CJ's decision to discontinue the direct negotiations was challenged in court by Impex Romcatel.
The Tribunal referred the complaint to the CNSC, which dismissed it as being overdue.
But that doesn't mean that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to challenge the CNSC decision before the Court of Appeal, only after a final judgment by the Court of Appeal, and it is possible to consider finding another designer.
Thus, the building's consolidation work could be resumed as early as next year.
Our intention is to resume work as soon as possible.
In principle, the re-doing of the engineering design shouldn't take long, but we have to get to a contract.
"We are waiting to see if the CNSC decision will be attacked or not", Timofciuc said.
The works to consolidate the former headquarters of the Police Chest started in 2011.
A first works contract was terminated in April 2012, after works of RON 4,5 million had been carried out.
The tender was resumed and the contract was awarded to Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the firm went bankrupt and the contract was terminated after payments of RON 1,5 million had been made.
The work has been done so far at a rate of about 50%.
Initially, the works of consolidation, re-functionalization and roofing of the building had been valued at 7,7 million lei.
"I'm ready to tell you everything!" - statement that could incriminate the former head of the Land Registry
One of the employees involved in the scandalous case file at the Land Registry Office signed a plea agreement, against deferred jail.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other accused, led by the former boss, Narciza Nedelcu
A consultant from the Office of Land and Property Cadastration (OCPI) who was himself accused by the DNA in a corruption case has confessed to his deeds.
The agreement on the recognition of facts signed by Dumitru Dascălu was registered yesterday at the Iasi Tribunal, the judges decided to give a solution in this case on September 29.
Dumitru Daniel Dascălu was charged with a continuing intellectual misrepresentation and agreed to serve two years of deferred imprisonment as well as community service.
As regards the facts alleged against Mr Dascălu, the prosecutors stated that, as adviser to the Cadastre Office, he and other colleagues 'fabricated several acceptance reports relating to service contracts previously concluded by the OCPI with the managers of SC Gauss SRL, SC Grup Cinci SRL, SC Topo Euro SRL, SC Agencia de Cadastre and Topografie SRL and PFA Lipșa Ște, which falsely attested that the contracted services had been fully performed, provided that they had not been performed and had not been submitted to the OCPI and the OCPI'.
Yesterday, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, as well as other former or current employees of the OCPI were sent to court in this case, the charges being the settlement of services to the companies mentioned, although the works were not carried out.
The damage is in excess of 300 000 lei.
Adventures in the stone age
In the opinion of FRH President Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the women's national handball team for qualifying for the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The president of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, during a press conference, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the groups of the Champions League.
As for the Romanian women's national handball team, "the main objective is to qualify for the Olympic Games in Rio, but for that they have to go through two stages of caudine furci, first the World Championship and second the pre-qualifying tournament", Dedu said.
We are very keen to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic demands from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants a secondary coach, a medic, two masters, a goalkeeper coach, a physical trainer, a delegation leader.
They asked us for the qualification of some things, specifically the materials for physical training, which we never heard of.
All this to get to the Olympics, and I'll do whatever I have to do to get there.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's a lot of money.
But that's the way to make a performance.
Because right now we're in the Stone Age of preparation.
"The teams we are fighting have these materials and have had them for some time", said Dedu, who noted that they are trying to obtain the necessary amounts to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The President of the FRG also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility of our country hosting a major handball competition.
We don't have a gym in Bucharest.
It's an infrastructure issue and it's a shame to call a European Gymnastics Championship into question.
Let's not forget that in other parts of the world, Olympic districts were built entirely within a two-year span.
Before 1992, the current Olympic site in Barcelona was a garbage dump, and now it has become a beauty landmark.
The same happened in London, where the 2012 Olympic Games were a success in terms of investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition", Dedu said.
He added that the international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organisation of a major competition.
It's a priority for me to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gaţu went civilized with a project, people gave their agreement in principle, but it became clear very quickly that the hall will never be built.
And I had discussions with the EHF, I told them that we want, that we are able to organize and they said that they agreed and invite them to the first match in the new hall in Bucharest and then we discuss concrete.
"So we have all the openness, both at EHF and IHF, but we don't have the infrastructure", the FRH official explained.
The former handball great avoided assessing the chances of the women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I have asked all the coaches to be reserved in the forecasts, that if they do not fulfill they turn against them".
Good road to the World Cup
Romanian rugby players debut on September 23 against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said on Tuesday at a press conference that all the members of the Romanian team are ready for the matches of the World Cup in England, where they hope to get two victories: "We are ready".
Both myself and my colleagues are at full engine speed.
We've been training to give our best performance in all four matches.
Everyone will have high expectations, because our goal is to win two games, against Canada and Italy.
All groups are heavy and ours is too.
Let's take it easy, first with France and then we'll see.
But surely, if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I can't describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it's the culmination of so many years of work.
I just hope that I don't disappoint anyone in the rugby family and that we come home with a great result.
"We want you to be proud that we players, a small family as rugby is in Romania, proudly represent the tricolor", Macovei said.
Romania's national team coach, Lynn Howells, who is on her first experience as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of the national rugby team: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup".
I'm sure the players are ready to participate in the tournament.
For me, it's an amazing experience.
It's very important for me that every match I make the Romanians proud of the national team.
The president of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitraș, is confident that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made at the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am confident that we will be at the top of the event.
"These guys started playing in Romanian teams at 18-19 years old, so there is cohesion, it's a band of friends, who have set out to realize a dream", Dumitraș said.
At the Rugby World Cup in England, Romania will play in Group D, with the following matches scheduled: with France, on 23 September in London; with Ireland, on 27 September in London; with Canada, on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy, on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition begins on Friday at Twickenham Stadium in London with England playing Fiji in Group A.
New Japanese culture courses organized at the "Al.I. Cuza" University
About the arrangement of flowers in a vase, ink painting, but also a casual study of the fine arts specific to the Land of the Rising Sun you can learn at the courses organized by the outstanding students.
The Japanese Culture Students Circle in Iasi is organizing new Japanese culture courses (ikebana, sumie and fine arts) in the period October 2015 - June 2016, courses for both beginners and experienced people.
They will take place at the Centre for European Studies of the "Al. I. Cuza" University in Iasi and are organized to promote Japanese arts and culture, traditional and modern.
For these there is a single participation fee of RON 50 per person per month.
In addition to art lessons, participants will be able to take part in exhibitions and other cultural activities promoting beauty.
The Japanese culture courses I have proposed to you were conceived as an invitation, addressed to the general public, to take the first steps on the road to self-knowledge through art.
"Interested people will be able to find out how to make harmonious floral sculptures (ikebana), how to capture the soul of the surrounding elements in plastic compositions using the Japanese art of ink painting (Sumie) or how to express their own individuality and creativity through the plurivalent universe of fine arts (graphics, drawing, painting) ", said Sorin Mazilu, the teacher of these courses.
The courses are open to anyone with a passion for art, regardless of age or experience.
Registration is open until 30 September, and those who wish to request more information can do so by calling 0742.027.153 or by e-mailing: studenticultura@gmail.com.
14 million lei to be given to the "St. Spiridon" Hospital in Iasi for the budget rectification
What will this large sum of money buy?
The St. Spiridon Hospital received from the Ministry of Health, following the budget correction, about 14 million lei.
The money received by the medical unit to be used by the end of the year will be invested in the modernisation and fitting out of some clinics, but also in medical equipment and technology for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
The health unit will be equipped with a new computer tomograph, a new radiology machine, six surgical kits, six ATI beds, an ophthalmic microscope and other equipment necessary for the medical procedure.
On the other hand, 5 million lei from the money received by the hospital will be directed to the construction and landscaping of the "Great Ars".
From the budget adjustment money, UPU will receive 500,000 lei to complete the modernization work in the main tronson.
"In addition, in the coming days we will be receiving the work of the footbridge that connects the UPU with the cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the transportation in decent conditions of the patient from the UPU to the neighboring clinics", the manager of the medical unit explained.
The hospital will soon have in the courtyard also the Dermatology Clinic in Tătăraşi, which will be organized in the outpatient setting, in the same form as it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area where the outpatient allergology, haematology and endocrinology are located and will have approximately 30 beds.
The coward, made fun of the RATP controllers and a flyer.
The Plight of a Tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After my experience, neither I nor my wife want to set foot in your city again.
They were unwittingly hit with the erroneous information in the flyers, the disapproval of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, a fine "as the law says".
The couple arrived in Iasi a few days ago, checked into a hotel in the city centre and asked for tourist brochures.
They also received a leaflet containing the RATP routes.
Armed with these maps, the husband and wife visited the grove.
But two days ago, they were in Copou, they wanted to get to the Palas Mall.
Since there was no ticket machine at the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the flyer: that they could get a ticket by SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Confident in the flyer, they boarded a bus and tried to text message the instructions on the flyer.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers has emerged.
They said the two-year service was no longer in existence and that it was announced in the press that it had been cancelled.
I wonder what the local press has written about me coming here the night before I visit the city?
I talked to the controllers, explained the situation, they said they don't care, it's none of their business.
The attitude was very defiant.
They said all they could do was give us one fine instead of two (me and my wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my day by visiting the police station and giving statements there!" says Ovid.
In conclusion, the family was amended because of the erroneous information in the leaflet and the controllers who "applied the law to blood".
It's not fair, and I made a complaint to the RATP Iasi to recover my money.
It's not about the money, I'm not exaggerating a lot, but the point is I felt cheated.
Woe to the rapists of Vaslui.
They had an accident and were remanded in custody
The trial of the seven rapists from Vaslui has moved, since yesterday, to the Court of Appeal of Iasi.
The first hearing of the trial was held in a closed session, where the seven youths accused of mocking an 18-year-old girl demanded to be released.
Before the actual opening of the hearing, one of the other judges assigned to the case, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for an abstention, which was granted by his colleagues at the Court.
The magistrate worked until the summer of this year at the Vaslui Tribunal, where he was president of the Criminal Section, and it was he who, on 9 April, admitted a challenge by four of the defendants, ordering their placement under house arrest.
The case is currently being judged by a panel of judges, including the Magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Previously, Judge Dan An­ton also abstained on the grounds that his daughter was in a cohabiting relationship with one of the rapists' lawyers.
The two judges have decided that the rapists from Vaslui will remain in custody.
The young people will remain in prison for at least 30 days, while the judges re-examine their release.
The next hearing will take place at the Court of Appeal of Iași on 6 October.
Before reaching the Court of Appeal of Iași, the van with which the rapists from Vaslui were transported was involved in an accident in the neighborhood of Păcurari, the car entering Iași on the belt.
The Iveco van carrying the seven rapists hit a Volkswagen car that had left Canta and the driver tried to turn left.
The van was traveling from the end of the pack.
The car went into Iasi through here because the prison administration employees preferred the route from Vaslui to Iasi through Grajduri, then on the beltway.
They shortened the journey by a few miles.
Immediately after impact, the prisoner escort called another transport to pick up the prisoners.
Soon, a car from the maximum security prison in Iași was sent to the scene of the accident, which took the seven inmates and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the arrested were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the rear of the cars, and the prisoners came out in pairs.
"The incident was not reported to the police because the drivers of the two vehicles had an amicable understanding about the damages to be paid", said Chief Commissioner Madalin Taranu of the IPJ.
The Great Migration
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what is to come.
What about Europe?
I'll say it from the beginning, clearly and emphatically: the 7,000 refugees that Romania should and must naturalize represent, in itself, an insignificant number, but huge in comparison with the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, of about 1500 people, far exceeds the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants do accept to settle in our localities, the chances of their rapid integration into Romanian society are extremely small.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose their temper.
Parasitized by interlopes and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves powerless in all fields.
The inability to integrate the Gypsies is just a common example.
In addition, governments of all stripes have been unable to absorb European funds, to build modern roads, kindergartens or schools, to provide decent health care, to clean up the slums, to create decent paid jobs or to keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country from which they flee?
But what is most astonishing is the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is dealt with.
First, we are struck by the warlike hypocrisy of the powerful EU states, which are extremely generous in sharing their troubles with the smaller countries.
Then there is the cowardly hypocrisy of the Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, still do not accept the other - of another language, another religion, another blood.
Probably afraid of being robbed of his national identity.
Finally, there is the hypocrisy of many migrants who, while citing the horrors of war as their only reason for leaving, do not accept any other destination for their exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Now, not all refugees are Syrians, and there's no war in Pakistan.
The simplistic way in which the crisis is analysed can also be mocked.
The causes must be eliminated, some say, and, relying strictly on political correctness, they demand peace and investment for the migrants' countries of origin.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital enters the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as a fractured, fragmented and outdated construction.
We lamented that Romania was not able to invent a country project, but the EU does not have a future plan either.
And improvising and threatening doesn't help.
So what good is the EU if the only advantage Romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be called into question by the waves of refugees crossing the borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
Not the migrant crisis.
Over the next few decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, and so on, will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially Africa to a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what is coming.
7,000 euros a year to rent the Pogor Club.
The practically imposed destination
The concession tender covers a period of 10 years.
After 7 years of being closed, the club in the courtyard of the Museum of Romanian Literature is offered by the County Council for a concession for 10 years.
The building has a useful area of 134 square meters, on two levels of hrube.
CJ accepts as the building's data destinations only those of a literary café, a bookshop or other cultural activities.
The building was valued at EUR 68,300, with the starting bid of EUR 6,830 per year, with a bidding step of EUR 25.
The concessionaire will have to operate the building continuously and permanently and fully cover the costs of rehabilitating the building, in accordance with the technical design to be drawn up.
'The Club Pogor building is in a state of advanced degradation due to the fact that during the period when the public power supply unit was operating in these spaces and also after its evacuation, no current repair and maintenance works were carried out as is normally required during the operation of a building', states the tender documentation.
The club's concession bids are expected by September 18th.
Two brothers from Tomesti swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital
Two 9-year-old and 11-year-old children from Tomes, brothers, swallowed several Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was on treatment, and the drugs weren't hidden away.
The children were rushed to the "Sventa Maria" hospital in Iasi.
They're in stable condition, as the doctors say.
An encounter that breaks your heart.
At 20 years old, she received a courageous gift: biological parents
Lost in hospital in the 1990s, when she was only two months old, small, sickly and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same year that adoption was loosely regulated, a young girl, now a blonde and beautiful girl, was reunited with her biological parents in a village in the county, after almost two decades in which no one knew anything about each other.
Crina will be 20 years old this year, and her adoptive parents from Palermo have decided to give their beloved daughter a wonderful and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, to Iași, to know her dark past.
"The Yassine Journal", who has witnessed the efforts of the family's search for the source of some extremely vague clues, has witnessed these encounters that practically break your heart.
The reporting of the reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are quite moving and overwhelming.
Crina's story begins 20 years ago in the village of Ruginoasa in the East, when she was only two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the city.
At home, there were disagreements between my parents, and my mother had to leave home.
He decided to keep the girl and send me away.
The girl stopped, and I haven't heard anything since.
"When I found out that she was in the hospital, it was too late", recalls the girl's bereaved biological mother, Alina.
Crina was admitted with her grandmother to the municipal hospital in Pascani, and at the same time the girl's father, Costică Balcan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives were about to be separated forever.
They never found Crina at the hospital.
After the internment, Crina's father went to work in another locality, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and the father, when he returned, did not find her.
I think it was almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"She thought she was abandoned", recalls a niece of the family.
Due to financial problems, the grandmother could not come with Crina to Iași, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one was interested in the fate of the child during this time, she was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection of Iași, who then gave her to the care of the Placement Center in Bucium.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were more loosely regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center she was found by Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but couldn't.
They fell in love with the blonde Crina, and after some time she was going to move with them permanently to Italy.
The baby was almost two years old, as the adoption formalities were taking place.
When I saw Crina, I felt she was our girl.
"It's as if my wife gave birth to her", smiles Salvadore, the adoptive father, as he grasps the girl's limp hand in his palm.
In the country, Crina's parents, Alina and Costica, continued their search separately, each in their own way.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but received no answer where his child could be.
The police then told them that she might be dead, but in Iasi the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I searched for her here, they told me at the Tribunal that she was gone to Italy, to Palermo.
And the conditions to look for her I never had.
We prayed to God that he was okay.
I've thought about her all these years, but there's been no way to get around, find her.
"It's hard", says Crina's biological mother, tearfully.
But even as the years passed, the parents of Ruginoasa were not forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past links her to Romania.
I was a little girl when I found out.
I was, like, five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents in Romania", she happily admits.
And her dream was about to become a reality.
In March of this year, Chief Commissioner Romică Ichim, the director of the Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Counseling Anti-Drug in Iasi, was contacted by an acquaintance in Italy, who explained to her Salvadore's desire to find Crina's biological family.
And the searches started with just one name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
We just pressed a name, the Coastal Balkans, then the locality, Ruginoasa.
Soon I had an activity with the mayor there, and I could ask if there is by locality the name received.
Then they gave me some clues, only the person they found wasn't the one they were looking for.
"It took us about a month to find the biological father of the girl", explains Chief Commissioner Romică Ichim.
In all, it took the authorities more than three months to find Costica and Alina, especially since each had a different address in the town.
We started the process sometime in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of the biological parents and the discussions.
"We then agreed to hold a first meeting in September", added Romika Ichim.
Last weekend, Alina and Costica saw their missing daughter for the first time in the halls of the hospital in Iasi, 20 years ago.
The excited father could barely hold back his tears, and his hands were constantly trembling.
He barely exchanges words with the people around him.
A week before the meeting, he couldn't even sleep.
He was all excited, trembling.
"To see your child after all these years is something", says a granddaughter, who also came with Coustic from Ruginoasa.
Crina's Meeting With Her Mother and Biological Brother
In his talks with his daughter, who is going to study at a well-regarded university in Italy, Costică Balcan told him, among other things, that if she ever wanted to return to him in the village, to come quietly: he could give her some sheep, goats, so that she could find a boy from the village and start a household.
Mother is also excited, crying, and hardly believes that such a thing can happen to her.
I'm really excited.
I never thought this could happen.
I've seen cases like this on TV, I've thought about it over the years, I've hoped, but I never thought I'd be like this.
There's a lot of excitement.
If she could forgive me.
I hope we'll visit each other in the future.
"I hope we can keep a bond", says Crina's mother, Alina, with tears running down her cheeks, as she holds a napkin in her hand.
She hides her tears of happiness in it, because she will soon see her daughter again after all this time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will be 20 this month, is trying to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she's sketched a vague idea of her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting he's trying to gather his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to reproach.
My parents are two moms and two dads.
But my parents are the ones who raised me.
It's going to be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope I have a good memory with them, because now there are so many things to say", Crina confesses.
First family reunion in Iasi
In Union Square, under the sky of early autumn, the family of Ruginoasa unites their destiny with their daughter of Palermo.
Crina is now 20 years old, she has finished high school, following the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
They are no longer separated by borders or countries, but by a barrier: the language barrier.
Which, with the help of a translator, an Italian restaurant owner in the center of Iasi, passed easily.
Those who made this meeting possible say that it is the first event of its kind ever held, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises, they will do it again.
It's the first event of its kind, with such an emotional charge, and I'm glad it's a success.
We at the Center have various activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with people who use, people who are addicted to drugs.
But we're trying to give something back to society.
"If I am asked to do such an event again, I will do it with great pleasure", says Romică Ichim, director of the Iasi Regional Center for Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Counseling, smiling.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, are going off telling stories.
They're understandable: they have a lot to say to each other.
Armistice with guns at your feet, yesterday, at the PSD.
Everybody's breathing his last
The camps of the Yeshenian branch of the PSD have signed a truce with the gun at their feet.
After successive rounds of talks, lasting from Friday to Sunday, the first and most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressed by the party's executive chairman, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the Social Democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates for party posts.
Far from being over, the party's internal war seems to have only taken a pause to allow the fighters to breathe.
Dragnea did not give an ultimatum.
He sent a very simple message, very timely in the current conditions: try to find a solution so as not to endanger the party.
On October 3rd, we have a party election.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we will remain in the existing structure", said interim mayor Mihai Chirica.
The two days of discussion over the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing certain had been established.
In the October elections, the position of chairman of the county branch of the PSD is expected to face fierce competition.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main office in the party's Ișeana branch are the state secretary Maricel Popa, the senator Florin Constantinescu, the senator Sorin Lazăr, the county councillor Vasile Câtea and the interim president of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
The mayor of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache, could be added to these.
One option is the candidacy of the leader of the county councillors of the PSD, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will no longer register in the race, sources within the party stating that he is not interested in the position.
The only name that was not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations of the last days is that of the former leader of the branch, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on election day, candidates can be filed, and it wouldn't surprise anyone if it did happen.
"The important thing is that we remain united, and we will remain united after 3 October, when we will have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent County Office and all the new leadership structures", said Câtea.
Until the internal elections, the leadership of the county branch of the PSD will be ensured by Victorel Lupu, a close friend of Nichita and Stanciu.
Lupu is on leave until September 29th, and the preparation of the elections will be practically ensured by the executive secretary of the branch, the county councilor Mihail Popescu, who is in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contact by phone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions of the last days as leading to "a partial consensus".
There is a wide willingness to maintain balance and unity in the party.
Partial consensus has been reached to support a joint team to deal with the county.
"On the other hand, there are several variants on the intentions of the PSD candidate for the presidency of Iași, the list remains open", Stanciu commented.
A judge in Iasi has rejected the Vaslui rapists' case on the grounds of cohabitation
The seven young men from Vaslui County convicted of rape arrive today at the Iasi Court of Appeal.
Vaslui men sentenced to five years and eight months and eight years and four months will present their arguments today regarding their release, after the court of first instance, the Vaslui Court, determined their imprisonment immediately after the sentence.
The case was registered at the Court of Appeal late last week, with Magistrate Dan Anton filing a motion to dismiss, which was upheld by his colleagues.
Anton invoked the fact that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is the concubine of his daughter, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silvius Ovidius Burda, the one who received the most punishment in this case.
How the Judges Reasoned
Last weekend, the magistrate at the Vaslui Court who sentenced the seven young men gave his reasons for the sentence.
In his motivation, the judge speaks of the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among public opinion.
"The court notes that after the placement under the preventive measure of judicial control, a measure restricting freedom but not depriving of freedom, under the impact of the attitude of the defendants, their families and local supporters, there was a strong feeling of indignation at the local and national level with regard to the fact that people accused of serious crimes are tried under a less restrictive measure", the reasons of Judge Vaslui are shown.
The magistrates also dismantled the main defence of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked the fact that the girl they raped would not be "a church girl".
'The Court emphasises that the moral quality of the person harmed is irrelevant, which the defendants wanted to highlight in their defence, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be infringed under any pretext', it is also stated in the grounds.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed in the past few decades cannot continue in the same way in the coming years.
Until Saturday probably few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn is.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many are wondering how much the election of a politician who is not in a position to make decisions can affect us.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical left-wing Labour leader since the war.
An avowed Marxist, anti-monarchist (he once asked Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingham Palace), a fierce anti-American and a sympathizer of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on political events by the TV channel "Russia Today"), and of the terrorist movements Hezbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and to leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at the time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden a true tragedy, ISIS is close to the United States' preference.
Following the model of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, anti-austerity miracle solutions.
The kind of things that Tsipras said and promised in Greece until he defied the real world and economic legitimacy.
The new Labour leader's economic program includes massive renationalization and money printing as a solution to financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the solution of printing money is not unanimously adopted globally, we would then have a general world prosperity! but who would stop such details.
Of course, we can make bankers pay a heavy price, they become a kind of enemy of the left, but as we have seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or in Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterand and Hollande.
The extra money is quickly swallowed up by the generous, unfilled promises made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher famously put it, "The problem with socialism is that at some point you run out of other people's money".
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance of ever becoming Prime Minister.
In the early 1980s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in his beliefs as the new party leader, failed miserably in the elections.
And then there was still a working class in Britain, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were much more influential than they are now.
In the new industrial landscape, where services dominate the workforce and extensive automation has made industry in need of massive high-skilled labour, Corbyn's rhetoric has limited appeal.
But even in opposition, he can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its latest issue, the Financial Times believes that the election of Corbyn increases the chances of Brexit, that is, the UK's exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that has imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine this kind of thinking with the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric, and you look at the refugee crisis that is shaking the EU to its foundations, you get an explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
But if the British people decide to leave the Union after the referendum, which is due to take place by 2017, the loss of symbolic capital for the whole European project and the deep rifts created within it by the Euro crisis and now by the refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leaves room for the most worrying scenarios.
The more so as for a whole series of member states, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which Berlin was becoming more and more the dominant player).
It's true, the British business community, the City, are strong advocates for the country to stay in the EU.
But today's Europe is not the Europe of the past.
There are many resentments, which are growing in intensity right in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, as we have just seen in the speech of Jean-Claude Juncker, is increasingly inclined to take major decisions against the vast majority of Member States by consulting only a few European powers, mainly Germany.
And this is happening as voter support for anti-establishment, anti-immigration factions that are also Eurosceptic is growing dramatically across the continent.
In other words, the negative emotional climate has reached higher levels than ever before.
Hence the conclusion drawn by the Financial Times in assessing the chances of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation based on the national interest.
If the voters make the brain decision, then the UK will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in today's politics.
Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we see more integration of the Eurozone, which will push most of the states in the region and the periphery of interest and decision-making into Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States are feeding their populist rhetoric on the frustrations of Western societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed in the last few decades, the generous social benefits, cannot continue in the same way in the years to come.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, Eurozone - immigration, both caused by hasty decisions that took into account only the integrationist political ambitions, not the capacity and willingness of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and may affect the situation of Romania more.
And it's hard to rule something out in terms of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to deal with such complicated situations.
Constantine Brancusi, the god of the countryside.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Brunch: "Take and sweep the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a big dream: to be somebody, to become famous, to be heard all over the world.
But behind his fame is something that's almost forgotten today, when we're being given millions of success stories, recipes for success in life.
That thing has a name.
It's called "hard".
What are you going to write about Constantin Brâncuși?
What's there to say, really?
His face appeared on the bills.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play him in a commercial.
Brâncuși produces and delivers money almost 60 years after he's gone.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear his name.
In fact, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he goes out with the cub, he hears the following instructions: "We're going to the park, to the Brâncuși".
The country is littered with his statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many people, from children to the elderly.
Brancusi's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
The Communists also failed to erase it from the memory and culture of Romania.
His quotes now dominate the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then again, what else would be said, written about this man?
Judged from the pile of books and articles that attempt to reconstruct his fate, Brancusi's life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, there are those people who tell you that unless you're lucky enough to be born in a big city and into a family that's as wealthy as you are, your chances of success in life are almost nil.
Brancusi's life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe there's a key in here.
Perhaps this is where the following text should begin.
With a sentence, however detestable these are.
Forget the silly success stories that are delivered to you daily in the newspapers and on TV.
Look closely at the figure of this man.
You want to know how he made it through life, how, today, of him heard a whole mapamond?
It's very simple.
He worked his whole life to be somebody.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brâncuși was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobița, a small village in the municipality of Peștișani, Gorj County, at the foot of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brâncuși.
Although he came from a well-to-do peasant family, Brâncuși led a modest life, but one that would yield the landmarks that would guide his late artistic vision.
Recalling his childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist would testify, in a meeting with Petre Tutsia, from Paris, in 1933: "At that time life was beautiful and harmonious".
For millennia, people lived happily a patriarchal life.
Everything went smoothly from season to season.
And you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has come down to us.
Brancusi's childhood was far from idyllic, however.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is extremely suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor's years spent in his native locality.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brâncuși. O biografia", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brancusi was 3 years old.
In the autumn of that year, when the pipe was made "to the cazan", following those who tasted the liquid to see if the process was going well, Brâncuși caught a moment of general inattention.
He fills his palm-trunk with pitch and drinks on the breathless.
He falls asleep almost instantly.
The first people don't notice until a few minutes later.
The mother panics, then goes into hysteria, thinking her son is dead.
In the evening, when his father, Radu, returns from the vineyard accompanied by the weavers, he sees from a distance the desperate signs of those who are waiting for him with their mouths open.
The party turns into mourning.
The father is already thinking about the burial.
However, someone finds it good to call Baba Brândusa, the Brâncuși's doctor and servant.
The brush checks the child's breathing, then puts under his nose horse dung collected from nearby.
The baby sneezes very loudly.
The people are applauding.
While the boy is left to sleep on the drunken, joyful partying with the loiters continues with even more vigor.
The next day, father and son meet through the orchard.
Radu Brancusi has Constantine gather some noodles and bring them to him.
The father sits his child upside down and, with the boy's handkerchiefs, beats him to remind him.
And as he feels the sting of the blows, little Brancusi has the revelation that the world can be seen from another perspective and that things around him can appear upside down.
The sun's position, unlike the familiar one, makes him wonder, as he would admit in old age, if the star itself is not involved in his disturbance.
Was the sun as disturbed as his father by what had happened to him?
At the present time, the city is not functioning
A member of parliament calls on politicians to remember who voted for them.
Independent MP Viorel Blăjuț called on PSD and PNL to stop the internal struggles and reorient their agenda towards the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a great divide and that's it.
I haven't seen any of the USL projects from 2012 that continue.
No highway, no Regional Emergency Hospital, just see how politicians are competing for possible locations based on real estate interests.
Let's put aside a little politics, and get together and talk.
At this time, the city is not functioning.
"If you're busy with the civil war, you don't have time for the people who elected you", declared the Fool.
He said that the current political class had disillusioned the Yessenian electorate, with the consequence of a very low turnout in the upcoming local elections, around 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
The MP also believes that voters will turn to traditional parties, expressing reservations about new political initiatives, such as the "Pentru Iași" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very little chance and will only break from the right-wing electorate, not from the PSD.
These parties are based on civically active people, who are usually right-wing.
"The right is crumbling further, which is not good for anyone, not even for the PSD", Blăjuț said.
He stated that he is not interested in a run in the upcoming local elections, debunking rumors about his intention to run for Mayor.
I also said I don't want to run for any local office.
I'm thinking about continuing as a deputy in the next term.
I tried to appeal for unity for Iasi and in the halls with the other MPs, and I was accused of wanting to make an impression.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this.
"If people have voted for us, it doesn't mean they are stupid to vote for us if they don't see anything", said Blăjuț, who said the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elected.
A colleague from Tatras said that he didn't have enough money and had to take the bus.
Let's not be hypocritical.
It's not a small amount of money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to pick up the money from the cash register.
At the end of my term, I will report on everything I've spent, except for the salaries of the staff and the maintenance of the cabinet.
I happened to collect in one month and 30,000 lei, with all the transportation, accommodation and other expenses.
"To say that a member of parliament does not have enough money is pure hypocrisy", concluded Bläjuț.
