I don't want to watch TV anymore.
Does that mean that I can't be an actor?
I watched a thousand birds on Netflix yesterday, and I saw a lot of people behind me giggling and laughing when I was talking about something that wasn't particularly funny.
It's obviously not funny, but it's not weird to laugh at everything that you say, like, "I'm a sold-out entertainer, so I'm gonna laugh at everything".
But if the staff doesn't laugh, the entertainer's mood will be bad and he'll be uncomfortable at work.
Like the old black companies, the industry is like a gym, and some of the entertainers have egos that are so big that they're just normally so nasty, they can't eat.
On the other hand, the entertainer himself seems to be full of difficulties in his work, and there is a lot of "don't blame the entertainer" argument.
I know that you're going to make a pretty small income before you can sell it, but you're always told that being an entertainer is a lousy job, and you're at the top of the list.
They are only a justification for the glamorization of their own careers and the fact that comedians are too high up in the media and society.
And I'll be honest, I'm in a pretty awkward industry, but I feel like I'm getting less and less into the entertainment business.
I'm sorry I complained so much.
I felt like I wasn't good for my body if I didn't go out like you did.

Get your hairbrushes!
I'm giving the buyer a sample.
I ordered a lot of stuff from the Tuxedo shop.
Summary: I ordered a cheaper wireless mouse, and the wired version of the mouse came in, and they said, "If you want a refund, send it back".
I'm not talking about the PC, but I'm talking about the sales pitch, and I'm not sure how to explain it, but I'm a celebrity, so I'll just write about it here.
The first thing I noticed was that at the Tuxmoney Shop's Tuxmoney Day Sale last Friday, I found an MSI wireless gaming mouse selling for 3,280 yen.
The store had the same price for the wired version, so I checked the page for the wired version, considering the possibility of a price error, so I ordered it, thinking it might not be a mistake.
We got the order e-mail, and the next day, we got the shipping e-mail.
And in these two emails, and in my purchase history on my page, it said, "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS".
I thought that this was the moment when the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive, because there was no error message or cancellation notification before the order was shipped.
And that's where the problem comes in. A few hours after we shipped, we got an email saying, "There was a mistake in the product registration".
According to the e-mail,
♪ I was selling the radio version at a special sale price, but it was actually a wired version ♪
♪ We've already shipped the wired mouse ♪
One, refuse to receive, cancel all calls.
Two, return the mouse and pay back the money.
Three, use the wired mouse as it is.
Choose your answer.
And they said that they had a separate product page for the wired and the wireless versions, and they had a separate product page for the wired version, and they had a separate product page for the wired version, and they had a separate product page for the wired version, and they had a separate product page for the wired version, and they had a separate product page for the wired version, and they had a separate product page for the wired version, and they had a separate product page for the wired version, and they had a separate product page for the wired version, and they had a separate product page for the wired version, and they had a separate product page for the wired version, and they had a separate product page for the wired version, and they had a separate product page for the wired version, and they had a separate product page for the wired version, and they had a separate product page for the wired version, and they had a separate product page for the wired version, and they had a separate product page for the wired version, and they had a separate product page for the wired version, and they had a separate product page for the wired version, and they had a separate product page for the wired version.
Wouldn't it be nice if you could send something that's not what you bought, and you don't know what it is, and if you want a refund, you can just send it back?

Twice isolated... typhoon and heavy rain spill the only bridge connecting the district, residents tripled their food reserves
Mr. Matsumoto Hoshiro from Takayama, Yamasaki, Fukushima Prefecture.
The 2019 East Japan Typhoon had a major impact on the lives of three families of eight.
Mr. Matsumoto: "At first it was like 'Majiko' right?
It was like it was going to break up so quickly, or it was going to be washed away". The only road leading to the Takeda district, the Takeda Bridge, was washed away by a typhoon in eastern Japan, leaving 11 families and 30 residents of the district isolated.
The residents, who were forced to cut off water, continued to carry supplies using the JR iron bridge, which is not normally allowed to pass.
Matsumoto Tsukuro: "You can usually get a car to the yard, but you can get it out of the yard and take it in your hand or carry it and walk across the railway bridge to get here, so you can feel the sense of transportation and the car's gratitude". The emergency bridge, which was completed a month later, was isolated for several days again due to heavy rains in less than three months until a temporary bridge was built.
Although the restoration has progressed more than two years after the disaster, Matsumoto continues to take steps to learn from it.
Mr. Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases.
"I'm hoping to have some sort of backup for two or three days", he said, adding that "there are about three times as many canned and canned food items that can be used for emergency meals as there were before the disaster".
Matsumoto Midas: "I felt that it was better to have a little reserve, because I don't know when disaster will come to me, and not other people".
To forget the lessons, the town started its own initiative in 2021.
The head of the Education Department of the Yayoichi-ku, Takashi Tōno, has announced that he wants to consider preparing for the disaster on October 12 next year.
I think we're more aware than ever that the unexpected can happen".

Be careful when buying a second-hand house!
The trap of the building condition survey system is the diamond online.
● Newly established "building situation survey" system aimed at reviving the second-hand housing market.
Prices are rising for houses and apartments, and the market for renovations is expanding.
While the coronavirus pandemic has increased homeownership, the increasing popularity of buildings represented by words such as "pre-station, near-station, station direct connection", "large", and "tower" has also affected the decline in relatively cheap new construction.
However, compared to overseas, the existing (old) housing distribution share in Japan remains at a still low level.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications (MoT) in 2018 started an investigation called "inspection" to amend the law on the trading of residential buildings, aimed at the trading of safe and secure old houses.
This is a system whereby a homeowner who is familiar with the home checks the condition of the building, including the deterioration of the property, and presents it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that the introduction of inspections has advantages for both buyers and sellers.
The seller can avoid claims after handover by conducting property inspections before buying and selling, which gives the buyer a sense of security.
It also leads to discrimination against competing products.
On the other hand, the buyer also believes that it is a system that can understand the condition of the old houses to be purchased, convincingly buy them, and at first glance, it is a system with great benefits.
However, the system of the current system, the building condition survey has the primary authority is mainly the seller.
In addition, I would like to point out that only the notification of the inspection system is mandatory.
So the real estate agent who's doing the mediation is obligated to explain, "You can refer an architect to the building to investigate the condition of the building", or "You can't", but the implementation itself is not.
● Risk of concern from vendor-led inspections, while, if you look overseas, similar systems are already in place in the United States and the United Kingdom, where the secondhand market is booming.
In the early stages of a home sale, the buyer asks a specialist called an "inspector" or "building surveyor" to survey the building.
In the US, for example, inspections are carried out on 70 to 90 percent of second-hand housing transactions, depending on the state.
In that the "buyer" is the one who conducts the inspection, the Japanese inspection of the "seller" is very different.
The seller tries to sell as quickly and as high as possible, showing the condition of the building.
The buyer, on the other hand, wants to be reassured that he can examine the survey and make the appropriate repairs.
Even if the same inspection is carried out, there is a difference in the aims and intentions of both.
Therefore, the following points are pointed out as concerns about the Japanese system:
● The scope of the investigations of vendor-led inspections as determined by the State shall be kept to a minimum.
Because it is not a detailed investigation, there is a risk of missing out on really important defects. For inspection companies, the intermediary company (seller) that introduces the responsible case can also be a customer.
So, it's possible to do a "sharp" inspection, not reporting any adverse findings to the seller.

Ginza was an island?
Five trivia things you can talk about in a silver bra.
"This is the place. It used to be a peninsula.
And the evidence of that is that you can show off a little rubbish in Ginza.
I'm going to tell you about the Ginza bean, which is interesting and I'm sure I'll want to tell someone about it.
I'm going to Ginza!
First to the zodiac.
As you walk through Ginza, you will see strange names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous companies.
I was walking with her in Ginza, and I was surprised by the silence, and I said, "This is it.
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
The name of the city that created the term "Okyō Ginza" in Japan, and the name of the city in central Tokyo.
Originally, the word "Ginza" referred to a silver coinage factory, which moved to Edo in 1612 (Kyeong-Jong 17), the current city of Shizuoka.
At that time it was called "New Exchange Town", but when it was moved to the town of Oshkosh, it became known as "Ginza".
By the way, once upon a time, Ginza was a peninsula jutting out into the sea.
Before the Edo period, the entrance to the lake from the lower reaches of the river was in the middle of the circle, and the peninsula called "Edo Prefecture" stretched from Japan Bridge to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula is now Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu opened his headquarters in Edo, he filled in the inlet and built the city of Kyoto.
In addition, the family made the cutting of the city to improve the city and to develop boat transport.
And they cut down the earth that had been cut down, and the mountains of Shoshona, and filled the inlet.
There is a stone monument in front of the Tiffany Ginza headquarters (Ginza Central District 2-7) showing the site of the Ginza office, so why not look for interesting directions?
The pilgrimage to Ginza, as you know it.
The "Ginshasa Ashram Circuit" is a well-known "holy pilgrimage" held annually in Ginza.
Of the more than ten shrines, the most eye-catching is the Kabuki Lightning Shrine in front of the Kabuki Shōjo.
Many people visit the office at the right end of Kabuki Noda.
Meanwhile, the "Lungkyo Immobile Jōgi" is on the roof of the Ginza Matsushō, and the "Ginza Outcome Jōgi" is on the Ginza Terrace on the 9th floor of the Ginza Three-Stage.
The "Boyoko Rinho Shrine" and "Asuyama Rinho Shrine" are located at the end of the street and are hard to spot. The "Toyoka Rinho Shrine" is known for being revered by Kabuki-kun star Shirimura Hanako left Shivmun and the "Success Rinho Shrine" located in the Yiji Shimbun Ginza Building 1F entrance is not open to the public except when around the eight-minute shrine.
The temple also includes a place where the immovable king and the earthly Buddha are worshiped, but most of the shrines offer lightning to the gods.
The rice factory, which is greeted by foxes in front of the shrine, was built on a slope, as farmers often harvest rice, to the benefit of the "rich corn fields".
This led to the belief that in large cities like Kyoto and Edo, there were benefits of commercial prosperity, and that religion spread in every bustling city and city in Japan.

Korea Posco International has acquired Senex Energy in Hubei, and is expanding its offshore gas field operations.
Posco International announced on 12 December that it had entered into a share purchase agreement with Senex Energy, and an investment agreement with Hancock Energy to acquire Senex Energy.
The acquisition is expected to be completed in March, with the approval of the local legal entity and the approval of the shareholders at the Senex Energy General Meeting.
The acquisition is the largest global acquisition and merger (M&A) since Posco International was integrated into the Posco Group in 2010.
The total purchase price was 770.9 billion won, of which Posco International decided to invest 50.1% and Hancock Energy 49.9%, respectively.
Posco International explained that it decided to make the acquisition as demand for natural gas has been steadily increasing even during the energy transition, and that the natural gas-based blue hydrogen will divide the market along with green hydrogen in the hydrogen market.
Posco International will acquire 802 billion cubic feet of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of 2019 natural gas consumption in South Korea, and will also secure onshore gas field operations personnel in Ho Chi Minh City.

The pain in his knee, maybe "deformed knee arthritis"?
Medical DOC, which is a medical condition that can be treated in different ways.
Editor: I've been having a lot of knee pain lately.
What are the possible diseases?
Dr. Murumasan: The causes of knee pain are injuries, rheumatism, and seizures.
Among them, the most common among Japanese is "modifying arthritis".
Editors: Does that mean that the joints are deformed?
Mr. Murumasan: Yes, I know.
The surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which is used to soften shocks and smooth joint movement.
However, due to age, obesity, and extreme sports, cartilage can become shorter or more distorted.
This causes deformation and inflammation of the joints.
Editors: Does osteoarthritis affect other people besides the knee?
Mr. Murumasan: Yes, I know.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the joints of the fingers, the root of the hand, the neck, the waist, the thumb, the thigh, etc.
However, the most common cases occur in the knee and are called "deformed knee arthritis".
Editor: So, what is the structure of the joint?
MR. MURUYAMA: The joint is a concave joint made of two bones.
And the parts that are facing each other are covered with the "articular cartilage", and the surrounding area of the joint is covered with the "articular sheath".
Editor: It's a complicated structure.
MR: Yes, it is.
The inner layer of the joint membrane contains tissue called mucus, which makes the joint fluid.
This joint fluid, which acts as a lubricant, is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfuric acid.
That's why they say, "Hyaluronic acid or chondroitin sulfate is good for smooth knee movements".
Editor: What are the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis?
MR: The articular cartilage is sticky and elastic, and it's the part that keeps the bones from colliding directly.
So, you know, it's kind of a cushion role.
But when this gets too low or distorted, it can cause the joints to deform, to become inflamed, to cause pain.

Three games and games from the Kaizie series that you can actually experience.
The Kagei series of gambling comics, which has exploded in popularity with a male focus.
One of the most intriguing aspects of this book is the extreme game that cost you your life.
I'm gonna see a picture of a chicken with my feet on it and I'm gonna challenge you to a cross-country skiing race!
So this time I want to test the game of kaiji that you can actually play or practice in a project video.
■ The swamp is a trap-filled patchino "swamp" that appears in "Kazino".
In the original, the high rate of 4,000 yen per ball surprised Kaiji.
This swamp was a massive trap, with "nail forest", "moving tools", and "three-legged crowns", that made it almost impossible to attack.
But Kaji used every hand he could, and finally he went out in the wild business of putting vinyl tanks on the building and sinking the ground and tilting it, and he did it brilliantly.
The "mud" in Kaiji is actually a game of pachinko, and many people play it.
Of course, it's not like "a single 4000 yen", and the difficulty is lowered, but you can taste the feeling of kaiji.
■ Iron crossings were performed by the rich at a "Starside Party" for the benefit of debtors, including Kaiji, in the "Human Race Horse" Iron Crossings.
The debtor is to race his speed, working to avoid falling on a thin iron skeleton placed 10 meters above the ground.
Twelve people participate, and the top two can win the prize money, but there are only four iron bones, and safety measures are inadequate, and the risk of death is quite high.
This is a high-risk, but VR game, and can be experienced very close at the Eagle Bridge at the Akatsuki Life Park Palace, home of the professional baseball and Tōhoku Akatsuki Golden Eagles.
This Eagle Bridge is a 20-meter-high iron bridge, preceded by the SkyBlanco and Victory Bridges, and is accessible on foot.
Of course, we have security measures in place.
The comedian Koala Sōstorō posted a video of himself walking the Eagle Bridge on his YouTube channel, saying that "Iron Crossings can be experienced in Japan".
E-Cards, a two-player card game.
The game is played with one emperor card, eight citizens cards, and ten slaves cards, and is played on the emperor side and the slave side.
The game is very well made, and has the characteristic that the emperor is strong against the citizen, the citizen is strong against the slave, and the slave is strong against the emperor.
Kaiji fights Liegan River in the play with a strict rule: "If you lose, you can cut off your ears".
When Kaji finally realized that he was being psychologically read by a device that could sense and transmit pulses and body temperature changes, he confused and won by cutting his own ears to the extreme and making his body abnormal.
E-cards are available in the market and can be purchased at Amazon.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikal has posted a video of Keiji Fujimori and Toriyama Fujimori competing in an E-card match.
■ Do you ever feel like you're a kaji?
It's true that no one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji's, but it's true that when you read a comic book, you just want to feel good.
And I think it's really important that you try to experience that worldview through the game.
A step into the new year, gently pushing the prefecture's patron saint to throw a big picture horse in the mountaintop newspaper
The new year preparations are underway in the prefectural shrine of the protectorate (山形市) and the big picture horse "" appeared next year.
The students of the Tōhoku Art and Engineering College, who designed the temple, visited the shrine on the 11th and celebrated the ceremony before the god.
The company has been commissioning original paintings of painted horses from artisans since last year.
This time, the work of three-year-old Tōryō Yūe (Yuyu) was used, drawn by nine people from the Japanese Painting Course of the Department of Fine Arts, led by Professor Mōtagō Minminmin.
The large painted horse is 3.3 metres wide and about 1.8 metres high at the centre.
The artist said that he painted the image of "the cherry tree gently pushing the back of the person who is stepping into the new year".
He stopped and looked at the cherry blossoms, wishing that he could "have the opportunity to admire the beauty of nature in a rapidly changing world".
The design of the Tōrō is also depicted on a painted horse that is distributed to the public.
Chiba Hsuen-hsi, of the Kyu-ch'i-chan (Kyu-chan-chan) Party, said, "I think all people can help us overcome difficulties".

What town is Yuno in 2030?
A group of high school students from Yuno City 4 are working on a joint workshop on "Yuno I want to live in".
As part of the research and policy recommendation project of the Yuno SDGs Development Center, the youth voice of the city is collected and recommended to the mayors.
"When is it fun?"
To the facilitator's questions, students respond verbally, such as "When you're having fun with a crowd" or "When you're playing the drums".
The first edition was held on November 13 at the Sunrise Hall.
The World Cafe, where 18 high school students and community members travel around a theme island and talk, created an idea of an interesting city, a city that was easy to live in, a city that felt alive.
Each idea is written on a sticker, pasted on a piece of paper and arranged.
"It's interesting to see a city with a lot of young people, and it's easy to live in, because there's a lot of transportation, like trains and buses".
I'll see if I have anything in common.
"Yuno was boring, but it's fascinating to be able to cycle along the beach", says Yuno, a third-year student in the Yuno Commercial High School.
The third-year student (age 18) said, "There are few shops, traffic is inconvenient, but the nature is rich". The adults interacted and talked about the challenges of the area, but also noticed its charm.
The second meeting in December was for high school students only to gather and put together a list of suggestions.
I will invite the mayor and the education ministers to announce it in February next year.
The director of the center, Tōrei Tōrei, says that "while nurturing the love of country among high school students, it will also be an incentive for young people to participate in the process".
The quake's magnitude was 4.0 in Kanto, and its source is south of Tsitsiko.
On the 12th, at about 0:31 pm, there was a magnitude 4 earthquake in the provinces of Tsitsikyo, Hokkaido, Garakama and Hokkaido.

How to find the new way to wrap a stall
A winter stool is indispensable, but is there ever a time when a cloth is tied around the neck?
And then you roll it up and you can look at it in the mirror and you can balance it, but you hear a voice say, "I don't know how".
I thought if I had a stool that didn't have a cloth on it and that rolled up smoothly, I'd find something new.
The brand's stalls, known as "Cottori", are about a meter long and more compact than the usual ones.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Can you make it this short and wrap it up?"
If you look closely, it is arranged in one piece so that it weaves a thin, long, cut fabric, and the whole is in the shape of a net.
The net is so that the end of the stall can pass through.
So you can wrap it up and hold it without connecting the ends.
It's made of frosted material, very light and warm.
This year, the top and sleeveless vest are popular, but many people wear them in combination with stools so that the shoulders do not get cold.
I think it's very useful to have a stall like this.

It's still one of three stories, but the biggest reason for the break-up so far was the impression that it was the environment rather than the Beatles themselves.
And when the four of them started making songs, they were always complaining about something, and it was fun, but when they started talking about what to do with the live venue, it was easy to see that the producers and the publicists were like, "Oh, the Beatles are out of the world!" and they were like, "Oh, they're out of the world!"
Well, the documentary also has a director's cut, so maybe Peter Jackson felt that way.
And I thought maybe that's why Paul was watching, because he was the villain.

The United States has seen more tornadoes and more damage due to the unseasonal heat and cold.
The tornadoes hit the southern United States on Friday night and Saturday night.
During this period, the atmosphere became very unstable due to the effects of strong cold weather in the south, which was record warmth, and the clouds appeared to develop rapidly.
Warm air from the southwest was pouring into the southern United States, setting a record high.
In Houston, Texas, the highest temperatures reached nearly 30°C on Thursday and Friday, local time.
The record warmth was reached at 5,500 m above sea level, and the cold temperatures below 30 °C were soaring that a large temperature difference formed an active front and precipitation clouds developed rapidly along the front.
It appears that tornadoes have been forming in the vicinity.
The southern United States is a natural area for tornadoes, but there are few major damage during the high season, from early summer to mid-summer.
The number of tornado warnings issued in a single day during the winter reached nearly 150, a record number.
The US Office of Ocean Weather Forecasts has reported more than 400 tornadoes and hurricanes in just 10 days, local time.
This shows that there are two concentrated areas that are largely separated by the southern line from Kentucky to Texas and the northern line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, the EF scale (the improved Fujita scale) for tornado strength is the EF3 scale, the third strongest of the six phases.
It is possible that the resulting study will determine EF45.
In Japan, the improved Fujita scale is based on the JEF (Japanese version of the improved Fujita scale) that is adapted to the situation of Japanese architecture.
The equivalent of this US tornado, JEF3, is likely to occur in Japan, where wooden houses will collapse.

A live call for help from the largest tornado in history.
In a statement, Biden described the tornadoes in the Midwest and South as "one of the largest tornadoes in U.S. history".
The report was carried by CNN and others.
Biden stressed that "we will do everything we can as a federal government".
"We don't know the full extent of the damage yet, including how many lives were lost", he explained.
The death toll has risen to more than 100.
In the state of Kentucky, where the tornado hit, residents carrying household items from their destroyed homes were hit by more than 30 tornadoes between midnight and sunrise on Sunday.
The tornado's range is 219 miles (about 350 km) and it was recorded to have damaged Missouri in 1925, but CNN forecasts that it was about 250 miles (about 400 km) at its greatest extent.
In Mayfield, Kentucky, a candle factory that was operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas shopping season also suffered extensive damage.
The building was destroyed and no trace of it remains.
In the darkness, a woman who was unable to move under a slide about 1.5 meters thick felt the weight of the rescue workers searching the slide and called for help via a live Facebook broadcast on her mobile phone.
The live broadcast, which was released to the public, included a woman's scream for help, screams, and the singing of "Happy Birthday to You", which another woman was said to have sung while crying to distract the fear.
Amber Brown, a convenience store owner in Mayfield, was safe in the basement of her home with her five-year-old son after a tornado warning was issued.
"It was a terrible sound, like a tremor, like something is coming out", he said.
A Mayfield police officer said: "We will continue until the search is no longer necessary".

There is a long-standing argument that there is a difference in the way we think about the star system's rating system.
While foreign countries use five stars as a reference and subtract from it, Japan claims to add/subtract three stars as neutral.
At the point of reference, there is already a difference of two stars, and the four stars have a completely different meaning in "has a reduction element" and "not a name piece but a masterpiece".
If you compare the five stars to "a work without flaws" and "the highest quality work in everything", then you have a systemic flaw that doesn't give you a star, but you're saying that you shouldn't give it three stars because that's how it works now.
So it's not going to be a good idea to try to argue with people who claim this kind of statement with a two-way review of Steam.

The long journey of a family that has established environmental activism in China's outback
(Find Asia, Hong Kong) China, a vast country, is also important in terms of biodiversity, with the world's largest number of mammals and third largest number of plants.
Some municipalities recognize the value of biodiversity and promote environmental activists' activities, not only for environmental protection.
The westernmost province of Yunnan, located in southwestern China, is one of these regions.
She is currently an actress. Sisappanna is a region bordering Laos and Myanmar, and home to many ethnic minorities, including the Thai people who share roots with the Thai people of the Kingdom of Thailand.
The Mekong River is the source of the Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asia.
The area of the Sichuan province is only 0.2% of China's total area, but it is home to about 25% of the wildlife and 20% of the plant species.
This time, I asked Mr. Li, who is working in environmental protection in Sissapana, to tell me about the activities he has seen and heard about in the area.
■ I started environmental activism with my German husband -- I've been doing it for 20 years.
What was the trigger?
Mr. Li, our environmental campaign, "Swanfly", started in 2000.
My husband, Joseph Margrave, was the one who started it.
My husband is from Germany and came to Sissapana for a joint scientific project between the United Nations and China.
This is the only tropical rainforest area in China and boasts a significant biodiversity.
But at the same time, economic development was stalling.
So, there was a massive logging of the former rainforest to establish industry in the area and to produce rubber that was scarce in China.
My husband was sent here from Germany to study natural resource recovery and biological resources.
And then he met me, who was a reporter here, and they got married.
- Didn't you have an interest in conservation before?
Mr. Lee, I'm from Sissapana, but I wasn't interested in the importance of rainforests or the significance of biodiversity.
So I had to push the project with my husband without knowing.
I've seen people with aura sometimes, but they're not particularly well-groomed, they're not particularly tall.
A famous actor once said,
Aura is not the kind of person who goes out with the intention of going out.
It's something that comes naturally to you when you feel confident.
I'm sure he's got a lot of confidence in himself.

I can see it.
I don't think it's that detailed.
I've never heard of a compliment or a detail, so I don't know what it means.
Did you give him a compliment?
What if I confess to you?
And I'm going to tell you, my heart is full of spring, and I'm going to ask you to come here.
And to get together, we want to learn more about golf and share what we love.

The first is that the TDD was caused by the environment, and it took about a month and a half to identify.
The stable data until March showed that multiple factors caused CTDs, which did not take much time to play from GW, and only took a little time to investigate on holidays.
Why didn't you analyze the log in .Net Script Framework (you'll see in a few minutes) ?
0 timing of the main CTD
* All papyrus, .Net Script Framework, and logging type .dll plug-ins are logged without leaving a trace.
* Some NPC kill/attack accumulation time: console kill also launched→Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree SE update re-launch version) OFF improved ※ Is there a possibility of wetsuit for this?
* Basic improvement in the OFF setting of the Kilmoov against some NPCs during camera work time→OFF the PC's Kilmoov setting via .ini: Setup competition in the DAR+Nemesis relationship?
* (Basic outdoor) Field movement + some magic (example: ice-clogged lunes) start, NPC hit time: SPID use of Dirt & Blood v 2.0 NPC application setting (top right of MCM) all OFF and all improvements in 5 consecutive attempts.
Is it due to an additional protective gear or shader setting error for some actor/NPC wear? Furthermore, the SPID usage default.ini 2.0 has a written error, but the result is the intended result and the premise Perk should be applied to the NPC.
Initially, I focused on checking the location attacks and the OnHit related motion/battle MODs (which are .dll).
I don't think there were any similar bug reports at least at the English, German or French level.
I was asked to post this in case anyone in the Japanese-speaking world had a similar CTD problem, so I thought it might be a reference.
And they're doing it with a little bit of a mental bias.
No one else will notice, not even my colleagues or family.
And you look around and you're optimistic that he's a very difficult person, and he's doing a good job.
But he's probably a little bit of a mentalist himself.
I'm not a retired mentalist, but I think I was a limitation just before I retired.
I'm going to be thinking about the importance of visiting a psychiatrist.
I have been visiting nurses for a long time because I have bipolar disorder, and I think I have a long and very good relationship with the nurse at the visiting nursing station that I use now.
Every week, I talk to them.
And of course, they do the things that are necessary for medication management, but I thought today's visiting nurse would show us how important pleasant communication is for people with mental illness.
Today we are talking about the gender gap and we are laughing.
I'm going to talk about sexuality, or why she got divorced, or can I do that as a visiting nurse?
Sometimes, I dress up as a woman.
But I've heard from people I know that visiting nurses in psychiatric hospitals are not able to work in the ward, and the aunt nurse comes in and just handles the paperwork, or the visiting nurse is an occupational therapist, and she says, "I'm doing medical work here", and she gives directions from above.
I'm using a small visiting nursing station run by a social service agency, which I think is a really good nurse who can be my equal and Frank's equal with mental illness.
She's beautiful, by the way.
And some of you are probably seeing a psychiatrist or thinking about it.
Visiting nurses are very helpful for people with mental illness.
If the doctor says yes, I'll take it.
And choose a good visiting nurse station.
I've had a few times before where I've been uncomfortable with the contract and have had to cancel.
I'm sorry about that.
I know it's a false alarm, but I was scared when it came out in English.

- Your browser settings are English-first.
So the number of times that Lot 6 is drawn, the order in which the least number of times it is drawn, all of the rankings are odd.

South Korea's hydrogen patents, one-fifth of China's... "Hydrogen economy roadmap is behind schedule".
The South Korean government has announced the 2019 Hydrogen Economy Roadmap.
The plan was to have 65,000 fuel cell vehicles in circulation by 2022 and operate 310 hydrogen stations across the country.
The target price of hydrogen was 6,000 won per kilogram (about 577 yen).
However, this year, fuel cell vehicles are only 27% of the target (about 17,000 units) as of November.
The hydrogen station deployment schedule for the core infrastructure is also 38% of the target (about 117 locations), and the hydrogen price per kilometer is not much different from the time the roadmap was announced.
It was found that the government's implementation of the Hydrogen Economic Roadmap is well below the target value.
The National Federation of Economists (NEF) published its report "Hydrogen Economic Ecosystem Current and Policy Directions" on the 12th.
According to the report, the fact is that the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are mostly dependent on the United States and Japan.
The core materials of fuel cell vehicles are carbon fiber (Tore) and platinum catalyst (Kingsera), and membrane membranes (Dupont, Gore, and 3M) are supplied by the United States.
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six countries that lead the world hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, Korea and Germany) has increased by an average of 14% per year (since 2014).
Korea is the fifth largest producer of hydrogen and the fifth largest producer of fuel cells in the world.
But the report said that "the fact that six countries account for the majority of the global hydrogen market means that they are actually the lowest competitors".
The country-by-country patent ranking is China, the United States, the European Union, and Japan.
Since 2017, China has been widening its gap since it overtook the United States to become the first.
The number of registered patents in 2020 is 22%, while Korea is fourth, ahead of Japan with 1033 patents, and 974.
The National Transitional Council proposed that "hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'national strategic technology' with a large tax deduction for investment in equipment and research and development costs".
It's been a month and a half since I had my finger muscles removed.

US aid weapons and ammunition arrive in Ukraine, training troops
(CNN) U.S. State Department officials report that by the 12th, equipment including small arms and ammunition had arrived in Ukraine under a security assistance program approved by President Biden.
The military assistance is worth a total of 60 million euros, and the last equipment, including four radars that identify launch sites such as mortars, will be transported to Ukraine at the beginning of the year.
According to a US Department of Defense spokesman, Kirby, these aid items included lethal weapons such as anti-tank missiles, "javelins".
The military assistance is intended to strengthen Ukraine's national defense capabilities, including the military buildup of Russian troops advancing along the border with Ukraine.
The United States has been increasing its vigilance over Russian military movements, consulting with NATO member states, and devising countermeasures if Russia invades Ukraine.
President Biden approved the arms aid on September 1 of this year when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the White House.
US military aid to Ukraine this year has reached about $450 million.
Since Russia's forced annexation of Ukraine and the Crimean Peninsula, the total amount of aid has exceeded $2.5 billion.
The U.S. military is also involved in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, the US sent troops from Florida to follow a multi-national joint training program supported by Ukraine.
According to a US Department of Defense statement, US Special Operations forces in Europe also play a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of US special forces operating in Ukraine is not disclosed as a matter of operational confidentiality.
President Biden had an online meeting with Russian President Putin on 7th of this month, but there was also a tense exchange on the situation in Ukraine.
The United States has also shown a willingness to impose severe economic sanctions if an invasion occurs.

The way the inheritance and gift tax reforms are going to make gifting "forbidden" in the first place, and the way the former chairman of the SDP, Ganjaliming, is going to be shot!
The first feature in the December 18 issue of "Diamond" was, "We'll talk to our family at the end of the year!
It's called "pre-life gift-and-inheritance".
As the debate on unifying inheritance tax and gift tax progresses, the concerned 2022 tax reform agenda has been passed, but in the near future, the royal road of inheritance tax control, the life gift, is likely to become "forbidden".
How do the rules of inheritance change?
With direct contact to the former chairman of the Social Democratic Party, Ghan Li Min, a member of the House of Representatives, he teaches the basic keys to gifting and inheritance for timely, profitable rush gifts throughout the year, including tax saving techniques.
I'm a writer.
• "to prohibit the use of life gifts from property owners to urban corporate employees, and to take a serious look at the possibility of creating a tax system that is neutral in the choice of time for transfer of assets, with a view to taxing inheritance and gift taxes more coherently".
The statement of the party's fiscal reform agenda for fiscal 2021 last year caused a great uproar not only among the wealthy but also among the middle class.
Because what he means by that is that he will change the inheritance rules and make the king of inheritance taxation, the "living gift", "prohibited hand", by making a huge increase in inheritance tax.
The rule of thumb for tax-saving progressive inheritance taxes is to "reduce the taxable property".
The most powerful of these gifts is the lifetime gift, which has been widely used by wealthy individuals, including business owners who have a small inheritance tax due to their homes in the three major cities.
This led to the debate about the unification of inheritance and gift taxes.
Although the 22nd fiscal tax reform package of the December 10 announcement, which was concerned about the quickest introduction, was sent, the policy towards unification was again launched in more advanced phrases such as "Review the current inheritance-time accrual tax system and the existence of the calendar year gift system".
The former chairman of the Taxation Investigation Committee of the SPD, former CEO of Ganjaliming, told the editorial office.
"The most important thing is to keep the tax burden the same whenever you move property, losing the advantages and disadvantages of the time of transfer.
We're simulating what kind of problems will arise". The quickest fix is three chances of a lifetime gift.
If not, it is likely that in the near future, we will make a big cut in the direction of disabling lifetime gifts as a tax-saving measure.
So how exactly do the rules of inheritance tax and gift tax change?

The film is based on the manga of the same name by Moriyasato, which was serialized in the magazine BE-LOVE since 2018. The story is a love story between a man and a woman who have borne the past.
The main character, Hailey, is played by Kazuoka, and the heroine, Rishi, is played by Yanagisawa.
The college student Rishi meets the senior Haili from his job.
Hailey, who suffers from insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly if he can borrow somehow the shoulders of the world.
When he finds out that he is attracted to Hailey, who looks like his brother, who was separated by his parents' divorce, he finds out that Hailey is a murderer.
The drama "My Rightful Brother" will be broadcast on the ground from January 10!
I hope that those of you who didn't get to see FOD will be excited, and I hope that those of you who have already seen it will be able to see more deeply into the work, knowing the development and seeing the complex psychological depictions of Hayley and Richard, and the two people who are in conflict and change.
I'm glad you're enjoying it, too, if you're a fan of the original.
I'll see you there.
You're a beautiful woman, and you're comfortable.
It's a natural way to warm up the body.

The NFL team that won by one game, three passes, and how did the players feel?
This game, Jones' pass was only three Patriots passes.
This was the fewest passes in the NFL in the last 50 years since the Bills' two passes against the New York Jets in Week 3 of the 1974 season.
The 1974 Bills had a late-breaking RB genius named O.J. Simpson, who passed 2,000 yards in the previous season for the first time in franchise history.
The Bills beat the Jets with a run by Simpson and another RB, Jim Braxton.
The weather was the biggest reason the Patriots played this extreme offense.
Buffalo is a town close to the Canadian border, and is not the same as the Hokkaido Turnpike in latitude.
And on this day, with temperatures almost one degree Celsius above, a wind of 18 meters blowing, and before the game, it was snowing.
The Bills were only local, and they didn't change much in their play.
He's got 25 runs for 30 passes.
Allen's passes are 15/30 and 145 yards.
There was no intercept, and there was never a failure.
In the ten-game offensive series, there were four red zone intrusions and one scoring attempt.
Especially since the end of the third quarter, three times in a row, they have advanced to the red zone.
But in those three times, he only got three points for one FG.
The defense before the goal in the final play of the game.
The Bills, who were on a four-point chase, committed a penalty on the 3rd & 9th, making it 3rd & 14th.
It's 18 yards to the goal.
In the 3rd and 14th, QB Allen, surrounded by a rush of Patriots defense, came out of the pocket and flowed right.
And then he threw a pass to T.E. Dawson Knox in the end zone, but he failed.
In this play, the right-sided ace WR Stefon Diggs ran a shallow-across and was free in front of the end zone, but it seems that Allen did not get in his eyes.
4th & 18th, Allen aimed for WR Gabriel Davis, who ran out of the end zone from the left, but the pass was knocked out by Patriots' DB Miles Bryant.
Bryant was covering the Bills' WR Cole Beasley with his man-to-man coverage, but on the way he saw Allen's movements and released the Beasley in response to the pass.
Allen missed two receivers and threw a pass to the end zone both times.
The fourth down pass may have been the deciding factor, but the third down didn't need to be a TD.
You can take two first downs.
With two minutes to go, if we had made it to the fourth and short, Allen's ability to run his own race would have been alive.
I'm gonna have to get my hair back.

It's time to throw away and replace three items that you've been putting away in the kitchen for a long time.
Sponge. What?
No matter how often you replace it, it probably isn't replaced as often as recommended.
A 2017 study found that kitchen sponges can reproduce a lot of bacteria even if they are microwaved every day.
German researchers who conducted this study recommend that you change your sponge once a week to keep it clean.
It's a flat board.
The United States Department of Agriculture recommends that if the board starts to scratch, cracks, or creases, it should be replaced.
Once the wound or the groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep clean because bacteria multiply.
If you are still fine, do not forget to disinfect frequently with a solution of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in a gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water with a tablespoon.
Dip the surface of the sheet in liquid and leave it for a few minutes.
After you have soaked it in clean water, let it dry naturally or cut it off and dry it with a clean paper towel.
Missing or broken utensils.
It may hurt to dispose of your favorite maggots, but the missing surface becomes a new breeding ground for bacteria and fungi.
It can also cause a cut on the lips or spilling a drink.
Yeah, it's a chance to buy your new favorite mug!
The first time I saw you, you were a little bit too young.
"You are forbidden to go underwater".
I'm not going to say "wuss".
"You can't kill a man with 30,000 arrows".
"Whoo!"
"You can't get hit by a tiger tank and die".
"Whoo!"
"You can't drink from a can of Hanukkah water and die".
"Whoo!"
"So you can take three minutes of underwater assault and underwater bridge?"
"Whoo-hoo!"
"Then you must train to endure until the next battle of the Citadel".
"Whoo!"
"Because you promised?"
"Wow, I got it, I got it!"
"You don't know if you'll get killed by Cao Cao one day!"
And then the general went home.
Of course, you can't practice three minutes of underwater attack and bridge unless you're handcuffed and put in a cage.
I quote from the beginning of the article, but did you read the link?
Community markets and trade are different.
I'm using Steam as a payment system in the community marketplace.
> This feature is more likely to be a victim of fraud, as it allows you to make cash transactions with red strangers, and only take items without paying.
It's not going to happen.
Trade is a function that allows you to exchange items or give them as gifts, not a function of selling.
Is occupation and employment different?
I don't understand why you think the same thing.
There are cases of regular employees in simple work, and there are cases of informal workers in intellectual work.
FlashBIOS is not going to run. Help me.
I bought a Ryzen 7 5800X and I traded it in for a B550 and a tomahawk I bought in September.
I went to the BIOS settings screen once, but when I saved the settings and restarted it, I saw a white cursor-like dot on the black screen that didn't flash.
Even if you try to rewrite it using FlashBIOS, it won't work.
MSI's blog says it's about five minutes long, but it's not an hour long.
I think the reason is that the USB drive I tried is too old and I'm using it to replace the SD card.
I'm sure you've been sleeping too much.
Is there something else that could be causing this?

Why is rice a little cheaper this year than last year?
It's because they're not productive, they're not consuming.
As a producer, I'm done with this.
I'm not sure what you're talking about.
So let's see what happens.
The first time I bought a haircut, it was only $1.99/free delivery.
I'm embarrassed to have branded products.
I have it if it's not obvious, but I don't have it if it's like Vitton and it's just like that, and it's written with Lv in a monogram.
Why?
I think it's better to fit in.
By the way, I think Japan is fine.
If it's Japan, it is.
It's not about the Gaizhin wind.
I'd say, "Why am I the only one who's being a jerk?"
So if you're an outsider and you don't care, you'd better just say you're uncomfortable.
I don't think I could ever imagine that I would feel uncomfortable with the odds.
I was living abroad on my way, and Japanese people who went abroad, including me, were often mistaken for people who didn't like the upper-downper Sanskrit customs and who were just sitting around and saying anything to the locals.
I think that if you look like a Western, you're not being purely mean, you're being kind of sweet and unkind.
If my friends were Westerners, I would call them by their first names, but sometimes I get a little confused when I speak in Japanese.
Well, I guess it's still good to be friends.
I'm just doing it purely normally, but I'd rather say it now because I'm not sure if the toothbrush will work on the exceptional treatment of being a geisin.
I was wondering if I could talk to you about Japanese rules.
Henk: It doesn't matter, but my white friend who is coming home always drinks a toast higher than other young people.
I'm sure I'm aware of it, but I think it's a good habit because it can make you look like a Japanese, and you can't be weird with younger people or older people.
Japanese people are so detailed, no matter what their personality is.

Thank you, 50 subscribers!
I'm going to start with the fact that I'm not a fan of the idea of a "sword" on Reddit.
I'm so happy for you.
Thank you for subscribing!
I actually had 25 subscribers yesterday, so I thought it would take a little while for 50 to get there, but somehow today alone, 25 people have subscribed, so I'm so grateful.
If you subscribed to this Sabre today, I'd appreciate it if you would tell me where you found it in the comments section!
I'm grateful that you can do it too, because I'm the only one who's doing it right now.
I'm encouraged if you leave comments and stuff without even having to be upset.
I'm not sure if you're on reddit, but I'm not sure how many people are on twitter.
If you're on Twitter, please stand up!
And finally, thank you very much! The Sabre I made earlier was a failure, as I thought, because people didn't come.
We're going to keep working on this, and we're going to keep working on the wiki, and we're going to keep working on the rules, and we're going to keep working on making Sabre easier to use.
And yet, it had nothing to do with the snowfall.
It's just cold rain.
I don't think the audience will believe me if I keep telling them this.
Did you fill the city?
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well.
I only have a limited understanding of English, so I judge only by the translated text.
I think the translated text is a little bit different from the text, but I understand what I want to say, and I think it's a level that's not too difficult to play.
I think this level of translation is common in games made abroad, and I feel like it's a good translation for a small company.
I wonder if a non-native speaker of Japanese can understand the subtle nuances of Japanese even after studying for a long time.
I don't know what level you're looking for, but if you're looking for a level where the Japanese don't feel any discomfort, I think you should look elsewhere.
Is it cheap to buy a silk in a 100 yen shop?
Or is it too high?

I'm a 78-yen tax-free guy from a business supermarket.
And I was like, "Well, if you live two miles away from home, and you go to a friend's house, they say, 'Well, what if you live with your family?'"
Do you all feel the same way?
And why is it so pointless to move closer to home?
I think there are many reasons why people want to live alone, no matter where they are.
What do you want to do first when you move to the Fog Island Hot Springs?
After entering the hot spring, he ate tattoos while drinking beer, and then he drank local wine while eating local cuisine.
The battle is the practice of contemplation.
"Equal Pay for Effort" is a human hymn.
Among recent children's comics, the most unusual feature of The Blade of Doom is that it "has a lot of practice".
It is a common belief that the series, which is mostly without battles and is practiced day and night, is not popular with readers.
It was two years of practice in the same jump cartoon, "ONE PIECE", when one side of the straw was gone, but I guess I could tell by the fact that I was just drawing touches and the rest was flying around in a big way.
Well, the eccentricity of the land that the Wampie walks through is one of the attractions, but staying in the same place and practicing can be a little bit less compatible.
Now, the practice of the main character, Kangjiro, began when he sat down to beg for the life of Hokage, who had saved his life.
The weak have no rights or choices, and everything is only subject to the strong by force.
That said, it was the kindness of volunteerism (which is also a communist underhand who does not explain his intention) that introduced the "upbringing" of the "upbringing" of the Ghost Slayers who trained the aspirants).
When first contacted by Kangjiro and Katsu, he was asked, "What do you do when your sister eats people?"
It's a fairy tale, even among fans, and it's a seemingly unreasonable conversation.
But taking a ghost sister with you carries the possibility that a moment of such judgment may come.
It is a kind of initiation into the practice of mindfulness.
But he takes a novice, a beginner, to the narrow misty mountain and tells him to come down to the mountain before dawn.
The mountains are thin and the air is full of traps, pitchers and traps, and you die before you enter the practice.
Still, with his keen sense of smell, he sniffs the slight smell of a human hand-made snail and is hardly able to avoid it.
But it's not like I'm suddenly physically able to avoid it all, but it's not like I'm suddenly able to get high enough to avoid it all.
Ordinary people do not suddenly become stronger without any support, and they only awaken to use their "so far honed strength and skill" to their true potential.
The "equivalent exchange of effort", which pays little to the person who makes the effort, but nothing to the effort, is a human hymn, different from the ghost with unfounded supernatural powers, and a moving, difficult rule that is consistent throughout the work.
This one, old?
I'm not a bed yet, but I'm going to lay a mat straight at home, and I'm going to sleep in a blanket, a bedspread.
It's not an apartment.

I think there are a lot of people like that.

No, I don't think so, specifically.

Samsung Electronics, South Korea, has created a new DX division that integrates home appliances and mobile phones, and it's "highlighting user experience".
Following the merger of the CE and IM divisions into a set division, Samsung Electronics announced on December 12 that it would change its name to DX (Device eXperience) to reflect this in its end-of-year organizational restructuring.
The aim is to enhance user experience through a variety of services, from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics has announced that the newly launched DX division will be formed from the following business units: VD, Home Appliances, Medical Devices, Mobile eXperience, and Network.
A Samsung Electronics spokesperson explained that the name change reflects the company's medium- and long-term business structure, future-orientation and strengthening of its global leadership.
It also emphasized the desire to ensure that products such as televisions, appliances, smartphones and communications equipment, as well as service solutions that reflect customer needs, allow consumers to enjoy an optimized experience with ease.
The name also reflected the strategy of creating a foundation of differentiated products and services and creating synergies across the organization, across the boundaries of organizations.
Samsung Electronics is already working on a strategy to enable users to freely access content and services through connectivity between devices, such as home appliances and smartphones, through the Multi Device Experience Council (MDE).
So 1500 B.C.E. is B.C.?
What happens when you say it in Japanese?
It's about 1500 BC.
BC means Before Christ, but based on the idea that there is a concern for people other than Christians, in recent years it has been increasingly marked with BCE.
BCE is an abbreviation for Before Common Era.

I also helped fund it on Kickstarter and I remember that I was doing a Japanese translation on the way.
I have a problem with preferences, but I don't think the desu/masu style is appropriate for a science documentary where the narrator is a man with a low voice.
I wish it was a more serious, harsh expression.
They lie, jaws primed, with only their armored heads visible from the sand... anything that stumbles into their pit is speared and dragged below.
> The honeycomb larvae lurk in the sand to catch prey at any time, only the disc-shaped head visible from the sand.
This place is a little unnatural.
The larvae of the honeybee lurk in the sand, allowing only the disc-shaped head to peer through the sand so that the prey can be caught at any time.
I think it should be.
I'm worried about
* Did you watch any other documentaries?
♪ Seeing it from the ant's point of view
Is that so?
And you'd think that if you translated armoured heads into disc-shaped heads, you'd get rid of the part that says, "On an ant's scale, it's a giant with a beak".
The driver of the trailer is not sick, he's not careful.
In the accident in which 24 vehicles collided in the small town of Kochi, Aichi Prefecture, it was found that the driver of the trailer arrested and transported was not ill, and some negligence was thought to have caused the accident.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 trucks and passenger cars collided on the national road 41 in Kochi, injuring 12 people.
Police arrested and transported 54-year-old Nomura Yoshida, who was driving a trailer, on the morning of the 12th, on suspicion of causing a hit-and-run accident and injuring a 71-year-old man.
The suspect's trailer continued to move without braking after the accident, and firefighters confirmed that the suspect lost consciousness shortly after the accident.
However, according to investigators, the suspect has no medical condition and some negligence is believed to be the cause.
Police are searching the homes of the people involved and are investigating the situation in detail.

The X-Men review of the fourth volume of the X-Men comic book series.
The 20th Super-Man Olympics, which began with three volumes, ends with four volumes!
It's full of new tricks because it focuses on just one fight, as opposed to the previous book, which was all about the opening to the semifinals!
● "Kin-meat Man" 4 volumes Review author name: Mugi-no-Mima X ★★★★★ ((5) of 5 stars ● Superhuman Prowess has already started before the game!
These four volumes are, in a word, a very thoroughly detailed account of the final match between Kin-Man and Robin Musk.
Starting with the signing ceremony, we're not really in the game, but it's never boring.
This feeling in the work, where the tension gradually increases that the first war of the century is about to begin, is certainly linked to the rise in tension among readers, and even this period is truly a calculated performance.
And one more thing to watch before the big final, the third-place match between Terri Mann and Lehmann.
And while it's a luxury card, I love how the man behind the scenes before the game turns to the poster of the meat man and says, "Now it's my turn!"
I'm trying to hit the chop.
But Terriman, who happened to pass by, took the dagger and stopped it, and then, without saying a word, the scene was just about to end.
What's great about this is that both of them have already lost and they don't have a chance to fight the meat man in this tournament.
But I'm so upset about that meat-and-skin man.
I can't help but think about the future of this!
And that's what it's like when a character stands up, and that's a scene that still hurts me as a cartoonist!
The two fights end without much of a break, but the famous scene is the plea of Rahman's tears after the match.
"Don't rely on the power of God's good fortune!"
It's a line from the movie
I think that this is a great metaphor for the work itself, because I think that the readers and the Kin-Man have always felt that in the end, he can't lose because he's the protagonist, or he's somehow winning because he's not good.
But by making Rahman make this statement, the evil teacher has stung the nail that he cannot use his hand even if he is ahead of himself.
And this is the quote that readers say, "Well, then, does the Kin-man really have the ability to defeat the Robin?
How can I do that?"
And I think that this is a great way to imagine what's going to happen in the future, and from another literary perspective, this is the same as the way that the teacher who creates the work is bound to himself.
I thought this was amazing.
I think that's definitely one of the big points of this book.

Winter illumination weekend held in the city of Akuma (Fukuoka Prefecture)
In the Akashiyama Herbal Village in Nakasaki, the first winter illumination begins, and the garden is enveloped in a gentle light.
The winter illumination, which began on November 26, is accompanied by a 20-meter-high knock, 50,000 LED bulbs scattered along the promenade and on the lawn.
Visitors from Shiga prefecture said, "I've been coming to Fukuoka for a long time and I was surprised to find this place".
I was so happy to see you".
The illumination is the first to be planned to help people feel healing while avoiding the closeness and is lit from 5 pm to 8:30 pm on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays until December 25.
Also, on the 25th of the last day, as a Christmas event, the behavior of the button pot and the film screening will also be held.
I think only a few people can read the documents in order.
I asked a friend who could read a lot of languages, and he was the one who could, but he was more interested in the basics of Linux and reading reference books than documentation.

It's hard to go through all that and suddenly understand everything.
I hope you understand.

Internet distribution, farm and livestock PR, endowment of the Agricultural Promotion Council, and media transmission from Mizawa to the Yamasaki newspaper
The Rural Agriculture Promotion Council, which consists of municipalities and JA in the Rural Region, has been promoting the use of live commerce to sell agricultural products on the Internet.
The Japanese military team, which was organized by the Tokyo Metropolitan Port District for the first time, "All Nations with MINATO (All) and Market TV", performed remotely and brought the local charm with special products.
The initiative "Odeima × Everyone and the Opening of the Port Project", a collaboration between the Ryuga Region and the Port District, was decided to go out and was broadcast from the Ryuga Vision House in the new town of Nanhara, Mizuho.
Kurodato Satsuya, who acts as "Rishan Somrlie", introduces the charm of the area surrounded by nature, with a stall of the Mizuzawa Weaving Brand "nitorito" (to keep and to keep).
I also told you about the cooking party with the army of love.
In the Tokyo studio, the comedy comedy "Tempopo" by Emiko Kawamura and the more than 300,000 registered YouTubers have been serving local wine, wine, rice and cow, and even princesses.
When I told the audience about the taste, they jumped in with comments that said, "The smell is transmitted even though it is being broadcast", and "The drink has a lot of delicious things and it's the best".
Is there a way to POST what you get in the form on the same PHP page?
If the value of the <input> element in the form is POST, then the value of the <input> element in the form is POST.
That's not what this is about, is it?
I want to plant a crocodile in my garden.
Is the crow resistant to the summer heat?
So, when the flowers are gone in the spring, you can cut off the stems and leave them 10 to 15 centimeters.
And the branches of the leaves will be in the roots, and you will be glad.
I'm going to have to congratulate you.
I've just come back from my first trip with her.
Her smile is so beautiful on New Year's.
I have a question.
How do you spend your New Year's?
I want you to listen.
Congratulations on your success!
I'm going to have to go to the lab.
I was unlucky this morning.
The power to the NAS PC is out.
- What happened?
1. Open the windows in the morning for air.
The computer is running at this time.
2.) When I get back to the room after a while, I notice that the PC is making a pink rotor-like noise and it shuts down.
At this point, I thought that the decrease in room temperature (~6°C) was only making the fan move worse.
So I warmed up the room and tried again.
3.) Do not start.
The power button is pressed for a moment, and the power lamp and fan start, but they stop immediately.
After that, I won't say yes or no.
I'll try again, but it'll only take a moment.
4) Connect only the ATX20 pin and 4 pin motherboard and remove the other parts and try to start it.
5) I have suspected that the PSU is the cause of the noise, as it seems that the fan of the PSU is hitting something and it has been making a noise called bubb bubb bubb bubb.
I'll try to find some extra ATX power later.
I guess.
If not... what can I do?
I can change the case and the mother together.
Have you seen a wild rabbit lately (in the last four or five years)?
Where did you see it?
Are you surrounded by nature?
I live in the North East.
They're everywhere near us.
There's a garden, there's a company parking lot.
2021: Most commonly used characters in the list of the most popular Japanese characters
My first use is the crying picture.
I think that for modern people, pictures are an essential communication tool.
Recently, many messaging apps and chat tools have made it possible to send pictures instead of stamps.
It's fast, easy, no reply, and it's a little bit of a hassle.
The soft, soft atmosphere that is so precious in modern communication is the very essence of the picture!
And then you're going to see what kind of characters they're using.
See all images of the 2021 most used pictograms ranking 2021 top 10 most used pictograms worldwide!
The overall picture is positive and bright.
According to the original Unicode, 92% of the world's Internet population uses pictograms.
And the first one is that it's 5% of all the graphic letters in use!
The first, third, and fifth crying-laughing characters are very handy.
When it was fun, when it was happy, of course, I did it!
And when you feel like you're not doing anything, you use it in a way that's not really appropriate.
And on the other hand, if you've never used one of the top 10 characters, you're going to see a line in the middle of a line.
I want you to stick to that style.

How do you dispose of your computers and peripherals?
♪ The computer farm
I have only brought it once, but I am in the city of Siguo in the province of Saguo, but I do not collect it for free from Saguo.
(It's free if you're relatively new.)
♪ Inverted net
I've never used it, but it's free to drop off and pick up in Sakowa.
I'm going to try it, so if you know more, I'd like to hear your reputation.
* Rough trash etc. * Payment * Reminder * Municipal collection box * Small appliances free
♪ I'll sell you a secondhand
I'm not sure.
I wonder if anyone sells them at a freemium or auction.
Maybe it's a smart move to sell it while it's still making money.
* Note: Linet Japan is providing information:
I've been getting in the way of getting it anywhere, because of a broken printer, old UPS, etc.
It's not a big piece of junk, so it probably won't cost you much, but it's kind of pushed back.
I collect coins as a hobby.
So let's see if we can find out how much this coin is worth.
The coins circulating abroad are worthless...
In Japan, the paper money is exchanged, but the coins are not.
And the commemorative gold coin has a value because it contains gold.
You know how you hate him when he didn't do anything wrong?
Yes, we are human beings, and we have to like it.

She can't, but is she being discriminated against?
It's not the face. It's the heart.
But it's sad that you're the one who has to decide.
I can't show you the inside.
What happened to your school uniform after you graduated?
I wear it as a habit.
I quit right after graduation.
And I was a roommate until I started living with her.
Can a person be recharged at any time beyond 90 or 100 years of age?

I thought it was a bad idea when I got the third set in the free throw challenge, but I won the full set.
The men's fencing team, Japan, won't win a medal, but they lose to the United States.
I think he's a little bit different from his semi-final opponent, but why is he in the third-place game?
I want to plant a blindfold tree in my garden, but if there is an osme tree, please tell me.
I hope it's an easy-to-treat evergreen tree, or something that will bear fruit if possible.
You're welcome to join us.
To plant fruit trees in the Fajãora, it is better to plant other fruit trees such as olives, blueberries, plums, etc. nearby.
How can we live together with the savings of each other?
It's every single person.
It depends on where you live and what kind of relationship you have.
I'd rather not live with you.
It's more likely that they'll break up.
It is better to make friends properly, to have a marriage ceremony, to go to bridal parties, weddings, and banquets.
There's no benefit to living together.
I think we should stop.
I went to the game center today and played an arcade game called Masked Rider Battle Gunbusting.
Oh, I thought it was a re-recording of Legendora.
