Not only does it confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely accepted, but it also provides details that fossils often cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on the upper side, with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called a spool, but have other features of feathers - rays and trails - the researchers concluded that the spool was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that the specimen shows an adult feather costume and not a chick's plumage, although the tail is from a young dinosaur.
The scientists reasoned that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathered plumage and not young feathers.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by forces reminiscent of tidal forces in the galaxy's dark matter and the Vintergatan's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts gravitational force on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The scientists were able to determine that the dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is contained in a kind of halo, and is made up of lots of tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
"In an interview, he said the new variant was ""very worrying and alarming due to its very high mortality rate"."
Some patients may have been infected with the bacteria at the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, at least two of whom were hospital staff.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a printed sheet of paper with their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting document.
French electoral law codifies the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot papers must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the voting and that no envelopes are added except those duly counted from the competent electors.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process, and at night, votes are counted by volunteers who are under extensive surveillance, following specific procedures.

Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
"Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, 'We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop. "
The accused were named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki announced that the accused entered the court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car collided with it, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services cut the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to hospital at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of his son.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but all eyewitness evidence could be rendered worthless because her image has been widely published.
This is common elsewhere in the UK but Scottish law works differently and courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that ""journalists take a dangerous line if they publish pictures etc. of suspects".""
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has told reporters that no further comment will be made before prosecution.
According to the leaked document, the leaked document is about the border dispute, where the Palestinians want the borders to be based on those before the 1967 Six Day War.
Other topics reported are the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel requests ten years of constant military presence in the valley after an agreement has been signed, while the PA only agrees to leave such a presence for five years.
Hunters in the complementary pest control experiment would be closely monitored by park rangers, while the experiment was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and culture at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting mission received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new provisional electoral council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
This is the fifth interim election for Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the former Provisional Electoral Council resign as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, which were partly violent, were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been postponed since 2011.
There have been reports of about 60 cases where faulty iPods overheated, causing a total of six fires and causing four people to suffer minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the units.
"METI announced last week that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called ""small""".
"The department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "very regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The office of the Northern Marians Rescue Service said there were no reports of casualties in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later switched places with an elderly lady because she needed to use the bathroom.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins began a career in medicine.
He trained as a gynaecologist and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would speed the fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first boss, and she died on the night of the double moon, quite unique, just like her, a strong woman.'"
"Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels said in a comment that ""Luna was as big a freak as I am... maybe even bigger... love her and will miss her... hopefully she's better off where she is now"."
Of 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view, that Queen Elizabeth II will be Australia's last monarch.
At the extreme of the poll, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his condition, there have been doubts about his fitness.
He has been unable to take the medication necessary to overcome his pain as it is prohibited in the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number to date, on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery with various hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of Earth's water resources, along with organic material, which could form proteins and support life.
Since comets collided with the earth long ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially the earth.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
"He referred to the rumors as ""political chatter and gibberish"."
There's speculation that he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would mean the plane flies shorter distances, saves millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduces carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology in contrast to older ground-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is provided, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride stations are not available on the ground level.
Fear of a lack of transportation opened the possibility of the match having to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is believed to have taken much longer due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory Española darwin finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes.
It can be drawn into thin threads that can be twisted and braided, hammered, or rolled into sheets.
"It can be made very thin and attached to other metals, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called 'enlightened manuscripts.'"
This is called the pH value of a chemical.
The juice from the cabbage changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH value is derived from the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Stir the two dry powders together, then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman society they were sometimes part of public baths where men and women would share a bath.
When you call someone hundreds of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it back down almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use space telescopes because the earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and field of view.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet [30 m] to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the biggest thing it has done is it has given us much simpler and faster ways of transportation.
It has given us the train, the automobile and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, everything from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including loose pet cats) that eat a much larger amount of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a special job for each cat that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the felines, and they live in large groups called herds.
Flocks consist of one to three related adult males along with as many as thirty females and young.
The females are often closely related; a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lejoba acts much like wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
As an all-round athlete, the tiger can climb (but not well), swim, jump long distances, and draw five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is part of the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, and these four cats are the only ones that can roam.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's loud roar but more like a phrase of murmur, screaming words.
Ozelot prefers to eat small animals, and if they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals that the ozelot hunts are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ozelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, by sniffing the ground where they have been.
They have excellent night vision and can move very stealthily, but the ocelot hunts its prey by blending into its environment and then pounding itself on top of it.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they often end up in a different environment than the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different functions or adaptations than they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new surroundings, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (breathe out).
Plants produce food by using sunlight through photosynthesis.
We build our houses out of plants, we make our clothes out of plants, much of the food we eat is plants, and without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain in its day, so it had nothing to be afraid of, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set of teeth in the jaws, which meant that there was no chance of escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacked everything that came down into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual delicacies such as wild boar, peacocks, snails and a type of rodent called hasselmus.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they could half-lie on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals may not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no cocoa, no potatoes, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods, which was considered to be the home of the god.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to appease the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that was accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziqqurat, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open dishes facing the street.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland as punishment for murder, and that when he traveled westward he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Whatever his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
"Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland".
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that is not true, and even if there is something on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words, 'Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776.' " The text is shown on the bottom of the document, upside down".
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we do know that the large parchment (measuring 75.6 cm by 62.2 cm) was rolled up for storage early in its existence.
So it's likely that the text was just written there as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
"It was run by the Vichy French, who were French people who had agreed with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them".
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called 'Operation Dragoon'".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and turned their attention to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people living and working together, a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city state, and also defines the size of society in some way.
City states are the precursors of nations, and civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural footprint and a fair distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and are not recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked all power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial body, it fell to the state governments, often uncooperative, to carry out all its decisions.
Nor did it have the authority to repeal tax laws and customs duties between states.
The articles required unanimous approval by all the states before they could be added, and the states attached so little weight to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful football team in the world and were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller-skating hockey and Formula One.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
With its many islands, Japan is often considered an archipelago in a geographical sense.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated a conversion of indigenous grain production, hiring Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After the defeat of the 1895 First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which gave sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like in the original.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still made today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the format of photo sensors in digital cameras.
The 35mm format is, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio in this format (divide by twelve to achieve the simplest whole-digit relationship) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as APS) correspond to this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The much abused and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a certain order in an image.
It is claimed that the best position for the subject is where the lines dividing the image into thirds meet vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was being scrutinized.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound European states together despite their differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power affected everyone from king to commoner.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are for that very purpose.
The central power of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle had been fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of the conflict, Britain instituted a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off necessary military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law as codified in several international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Britain was mining international waters to prevent any vessel from crossing entire areas of the sea, making it dangerous even for neutral vessels.
Since this tactic had received a limited response, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude was pacifism and isolationism among most of the inhabitants and countries.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war in World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to begin working for the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his former job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different periods of time; each stage in Chinese history, or each family that held power, was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable period in which the provinces were divided, the most famous of these being the Three Kingdoms, which took place between the 60 years between the Han and Jind dynasties.
During these periods, violent warfare often took place between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history when thousands of people died in the battle for the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, the professions were opened up to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to steal success.
The same was true of the military, as ranks in the army were now based on caliber rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to make revolution.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in subjects beyond his everyday life. He often visited a cave that became known as ""Hira"" on ""Noor"" (light) mountain to meditate".
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, provides a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
The cave, located on one of the mountain peaks north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if you know it's there, because inside the cave, it's totally isolated.
You can't see anything but the clear, beautiful sky and the many mountains that surround it, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Pyramid of Cheops is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
"The Giza Plateau, or ""Giza Necropolis"" in the Egyptian Valley of Death contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tomb monuments, several temples, and the Great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
'The mark for "upward-sloping" shall be in the form of a V and the mark for "downward-sloping" shall be in the form of a clasp or a rectangle without a bottom.'
Up means you should start at the tip and push the straw upwards, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand is holding the straw) and pull the straw downwards.
An upstroke usually generates a softer sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more resolutely expressed.
You may draw your own markings, but keep in mind that the printed line markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Marie Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their car windows open at the gable.
On one occasion, a mob member waved the head of an imperial guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of the conquest of the Philippines by American imperialism were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the cost and interest of bonds in the name of the Philippine government through the banks of Wall Street.
Of course, the great profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic profits of American imperialism.
To understand the temple lords, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is often called the high middle ages, the period of European history from the 11th to the 14th centuries.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which formally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many different ideas in practice, from the idea that technology drives development or the technological imperative to the strict view that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic that relates to the laws of nature and how they are manifested in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a trajectory that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has ""effects"" on societies that are primitive, rather than socially conditioned".
For example, it could be said that the motorized car will inevitably lead to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically sustainable for only a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism contained a large element of determinism originating with writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was shaped by individuals and, over time, customs and cultures related to this geography emerged, and these, which were in harmony with the location of the society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the feudal fashion capital of Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began to circulate about A.D. 400 and continued until about A.D. 1100.
Its influence declined in the 14th century, primarily because of the fact that the crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued higher than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its height between the 11th, 12th, and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, because of the slow communication routes, the styles in the West could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Self-sufficient farming is farming that is carried out for the production of enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family alone.
Self-catering farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses saved seeds originating from the ecoregion combined with rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers were self-sufficient, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by society and allow them to find their identity.
Subcultures may be distinct because of the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive may be of a linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical nature, or it may be a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic style choice, which includes fashion, manner, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
"Such children are called 'savages.' Some savages have been shut up by humans (often their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities".
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness all by themselves.
When the feral child is raised entirely by non-human animals, it exhibits behavior (within physical limits) almost identical to that of the specific pet, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, tutoring goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a support to individuals learning something new, for example, to use a new computer program or to start a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of support, but it is also the little gem-man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalised in the software and is intended to question, guide and explain methods that may have been too challenging for the learner to cope with on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring or educational, but it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our family home system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster homes are meant to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the homes they came from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive character of the Internet leads to additional dimensions in terms of user theory.
"For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are suggested as important motivating factors for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified 'personal engagement' and 'continuous relationships' as new motivational aspects when they examined audience responses on websites".
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial expressions that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
"Oliver Sacks showed in his book "The President's Speech" how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still judge sincerity correctly".
He even claims that we share such a skill in interpreting human behavior with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination slide back and forth between the two poles for each new generation.
Out on the savannah, a primate with a digestive system like that of man has difficulty satisfying its need for amino acids from the plants available.
Moreover, a lack of this has serious consequences; stunted growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
By comparison, animal food (ant, termite, egg) is not only easily digestible but also offers high-quality proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
"After all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their ""protein problem"" in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today".
Sleep apnea is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly afterwards (1060 minutes).
This can be done simply by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you closer to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you turn off the clock in your sleep, you can set it at the other end of the room, so that you have to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a known dehydrator) before sleep, which causes one to have to get up and pee.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present life force, and each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded with the path of love in Mahayana and many techniques in Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga is a practice of awakening the kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The Godsyogan is central to Tibetan meditation, where by visualizing different gods, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, and when the war ended, differences in systems, processes and culture led to the collapse of cooperation between the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought physically by contract armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland and simultaneously violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
By far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans is to use ships to transport goods.
The fleets' job has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while disrupting the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, in which the Americans tried to move troops and materiel across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, mainly using U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes used them for milk, fur, meat and skin.
Tamgets were usually kept in packs that roamed on hills or other grazing areas, often chosen by shepherds who were often children or youths, similar to the more familiar sheep herd.
Carriage tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though wagon roads consisted only of parallel wooden planks, the horses that pulled them allowed them to reach higher speeds and carry greater loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Grinders were introduced early to keep the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that rails would be more effective if they had a layer of iron over them.
This became the norm, but the iron was more prone to wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
The first all-iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known means of transportation was walking, and humans began to walk upright two million years ago when Homo erectus (which means the upright man) saw the light of day.
Their predecessor, australopithecus, was not accustomed to walking upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can get involved in the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases like symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and deactivate it.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been aggravated by overpopulation and man's extravagant life-style.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing plant a few blocks away.
"Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 pages of the Dunlap Bible that are known to exist are the oldest extant copies of the document.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today, and we call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many things in birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal intoxication is not always immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too general to allow an immediate diagnosis.
The best sign of poisoning can be an open jar of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific toxin.
The term "beetle" is used in a formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term is derived from ancient affinity with the wall-lily, an insect highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both beetles and wall lice are resident, adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their children, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to establish an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to find out how the world works by using the scientific method, which in fact guides almost all research.
Experimentation, where an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions and make observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often due in large part to the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-contained oscillator that repeats its cycle for a period of time even in the absence of external influence.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first to suggest that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments that marked either the DNA of the substance with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the substance with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are sex cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of experiencing the landscape, including its plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is to visit, photograph and learn more about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns in cars to go to their jobs and are passed by others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private motoring.
Science now shows that this massive collectivism has upset the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, similar complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing are seldom heard.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis, are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because traffic behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
As well, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently; thus, traffic tends to flow somewhat consistently and can be presented in large part mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, the relationship between three main variables has been established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions are helpful in the planning, design and operation of roadside establishments.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings along their body.
This gives them more small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the troll gulls and the day-flying gulls.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many thought the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and also the other stars).
This seems reasonable, since the earth does not feel like it is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the world's second-most water-rich and second-longest river, with a water flow of more than eight times that of the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, 9 kilometers wide in some places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the world's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main course is 4,000 miles [6,387 km] and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and construction technique.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which by then were well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican City State is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican State uses Italian in its legislation and in official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican State are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemicals such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, when they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was composed of one or more of a total of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four phases of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he had theories that they change into new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there are many different elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered to be metals.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of nonmetallic substances such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a faithful companion for many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as more modern writing methods have developed, the pencil has become less prestigious and has fewer uses.
Today, people type messages on computer screens, and they never have to come near a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to produce a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, and splitting the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, and it doesn't take much for them to break apart.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 43 miles [70 km] thick on the front side and 60 miles [100 km] on the rear.
It's thinner under the moonlight and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner there, which made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories revolve around figuring out what makes people tick or what appeals to them.
Theories hold that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want what they want and what in their environment is what makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former peers. At one end of the spectrum, the manager tries to remain ""one of the gang""".
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, administering discipline, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she has to change everything that the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often results in a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams hold the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members tend to act as a point of contact for the physical group.
They often have more say than conventional team members as different time zones can affect when their teams can meet and this may not be understood by the management locally.
"The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".
"The 'invisible team' is the management group to which all members report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member".
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and inventiveness can flourish.
Therefore, the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organisation can become innovative, the leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a methodology used to support organisations in achieving a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and therefore makes the field of research narrower and much more precise.
The correlation between brain disease and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, diseases and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although strongly associated with science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science that involves machine behavior, learning, and intelligence.
AI research is about getting machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and even handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now widely used in finance, medicine, engineering and the military, and has been incorporated into several home computers and video game software applications.
Field studies are a major part of the teaching in each class, and often the teacher wants to take the students to places where there are no buses.
Technology offers solutions with virtual study visits, where students can look at museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a study trip virtually is also a good way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital; the website is re-designed each year, but previous versions may remain online as a scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills, and students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of readers generally improving this.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to write better to avoid criticism.
Blogging also 'forces students to become more aware of the world around them'. e need to satisfy readers' interest stimulates students to be quick and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"The appropriate use of blogs ""may enable pupils to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet material, pupils may define their positions in relation to what others have written, as well as articulate their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, offering a series of galleries and museums that show Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and in the north, the beautiful, untouched landscape of the Muscoco.
All of this and more distinguishes Ontario as the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas farther north are very sparsely populated, and some are nearly uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent of its own in terms of fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are part of France, and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the areas, which had a major impact in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope, thereby finding the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is good to wear a ring too (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for someone to follow you, grab your arm, etc.
Be firm in your refusal to accept men and do not be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences do not make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 11th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Merenids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city of Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagine, pottery, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of cream scraps, but all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the central parts.
Goma is relatively safe, but if you're visiting outside of Goma, you should check out the fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest tracking of mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price for the short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, remote places".
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its fame makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS program Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities of the country, with an atmosphere that is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile river.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each one harbouring different wildlife.
It is one of the largest attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all other South African national parks, the park charges daily maintenance and entrance fees.
It may also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, which gives access to either a selection of South African parks or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider as their main focus.
The row of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a glittering bar chart that is enhanced by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront across the street.
The vast majority of Hong Kong's settlements are clustered on the former seabed along the northern coast.
This is the site that the British colonizers took over, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 50 miles into Bangladesh and the Indian interior from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been accepted as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest that is on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps - they contain some of the last remaining vestiges of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is wetlands.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 deer in the area.
Buses leave from the district's common bus station (across the river) all day, but most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, run between 6.30 and 7.30.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is good advice to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers rise 83 meters, the longest one is 378 meters, and the two aisles are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical free height under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs stations are expected to be ready.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting present-day eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chacoregion was populated by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who lived as hunters, gatherers and fishermen.
"In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the 'giant Indian province', was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and groups of the native population".
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches, please contact the Asociación Argentina de polo.
The official Falklands currency is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which is equivalent to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
As a rule, GBP is accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley it is often possible to pay with credit cards and USD.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the remote islands, but British and American currency may be accepted; contact the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so change money before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
"There are no special 'rainy' and 'dry' seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year".
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park officials, you must stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from any other wildlife!
However docile they may be, bison, moose, deer, bear, and almost any other large animal can be attacked.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep adequate distance.
Also, bear in mind that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid smelly food and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia, on the island of Upolu, and it has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of a notorious stalemate in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, with nearly 200 American and German lives lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to Auckland's location between two harbours, with the most popular beaches divided into three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them have sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and on most of them the Maori offer shade.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes well-visited family beaches with a good range of shops located along the beach.
"The main local beer is 'Number one', which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is 'Manta'".
There are many French wines, but perhaps the New Zealand and Australian wines will do better for the trip.
The local drinking water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're worried.
"For Australians, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is unknown. A 'short black' is 'espresso', cappuccino has a high cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk".
The hot chocolate milk meets Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year and damage due to any of these causes on the reef is rare.
Still, take the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Kubmanets occur near beaches and near river mouths from October to April 1770.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
The saltwater crocodile's main habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton, so they do not usually live in the sea.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind and a guarantee that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even flight-hotel packages.
They can also reserve your booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents required for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, all changes and requests should go through the travel agency first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors decide to camp on site, and most visitors see it as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to where things are happening, you'll have to get there early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember, even though the music performances on the main stage have ended, parts of the festival may continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin placement, because going through ice causes really awful noises for those who are most affected.
Cruise ships to St. Petersburg include time in the city.
Casinos often go to great lengths to make guests spend as much time and money as possible.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests happy and to keep them in the premises.
Some establishments offer free alcoholic beverages, but getting drunk impairs judgment, and all good players know the importance of keeping sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or over mountains should be aware that snow, ice and temperatures below freezing may occur.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you can't drive the same way as on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to cause you to get stuck.
Visibility may also be restricted by snowfall or hail or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues virtually uninterrupted year-round.
Safari is perhaps the largest tourism industry in Africa and the highlight of many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to trips across the country to see the amazing African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and with standard equipment it is possible to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and they are better seen with binoculars.
"A walking safari (also called a 'bush walk' or a 'hiking safari') consists of a walking tour of either a few hours or several days".
The Paralympics will run from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events held at other venues around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodations before the launch was announced, you may be in a tough spot.
The cancellation policies for the coronavirus vary, but by the end of March, most do not extend as far as July 2020, when the Olympic Games would have started.
It is expected that most tickets to events will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with a typical ticket price of around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry, and many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if they are not in the room.
If no ironing iron is available, or if you do not want to wear socks with a sock, try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the cloth get too hot (which may cause shrinkage or in extreme cases, burning).
There are different sets to purify water on, and some are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling the water for a minute is enough; in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters can vary in efficiency, and if you are unsure, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans, are not usually classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the ability to buy goods without taxes or other charges in certain places.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh National Scenic Byway, which often passes through isolated wilderness.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, drive sensibly: steep inclines, narrow lanes and sharp curves are common.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and that they are adhered to is even more important than otherwise.
Strangely, the cell phone coverage here is much better than along many other trails, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are really good, and in Bavaria they are quite powerful and varied, similar to those from the neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples baked in pastries all year round, and cherries and plums in the summer.
Many German bakeries also have almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and popular cakes often go especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but powerful pastries, try the Berliner, the Pfannkuchen or the Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid".
In northern India and inland regions of Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry dishes; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a collective term that encompasses a wide variety of regional dishes scattered throughout the country.
But when used without an adjective, the term tends to refer to food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now available throughout the archipelago, offers a wealth of simple spiced dishes, with the flavourings most used by the Javanese being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The footrests are supports for the rider's feet, which hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can pose a safety hazard as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown by a horse but has one foot stuck in the stirrup, the rider can be released if the horse runs away.
First, most riders have heeled boots and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that cause a ladder to be pulled back from the saddle by a rider who falls off.
The Cochamó Valley, Chile's premier climbing destination, is known as South America's Yosemite, and it has a number of large granite cliffs and walls.
The mountain peaks offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes through the countless mountain walls.
Outdoor sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which people glide down a snowy landscape with skis or a snowboard strapped to their feet.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiasts, sometimes called ski lovers, who plan their entire holiday trip around skiing in a certain area.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5,000 B.C.!
Outdoor skiing has been a sport since at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on ski slopes: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, cross-country skiing or ski walking.
It is related to but usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountain climbing, the latter being performed in steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover somewhat more distance than walking  but you will rarely reach speeds like cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack in prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries, and in normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would involve multiple visa applications and passport controls.
However, the Schengen area functions more or less as a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport controls again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen country separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are antiques, and some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where age limits may be shorter in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Craft goods can be defined as antiques, although they are not as old as similar mass-produced goods.
Renskötsel is an important source of income for the Sami people and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many other professions.
Historically, however, not all Sami have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived from fishing, hunting and the like and used the reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern industries, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.
"Although frequently used, especially among non-Roma, the word 'Gypsy' is often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Roma people".
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel restriction, your travel medical insurance or cancellation cover may be affected.
You may also wish to consult other governments than your own, but their advice is designed for their own citizens.
For example, circumstances may be different for American citizens in the Middle East compared with those of Europeans or Arabs.
A travel advice is just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The picture presented is often hasty, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available from elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for all hazardous weather events with the potential to cause harm, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Severe weather events can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different variations of them, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, heavy rainfall and wildfires are types and effects of extreme weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, hailstorms and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include frequent snowstorms, blizzards, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather affecting their area, as it may affect their travel plans.
Anyone who plans to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
"A search on the Internet for 'hostile environmental education' will probably give the address of a local business".
A course usually covers all the issues mentioned here, although in much more detail, usually with practical exercises.
A course normally lasts between 2-5 days and includes role-playing, very first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are plenty of books on how to survive in the wilderness, while books on war zones are rare.
Travelers planning to undergo sex-rehabilitation surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without a gender (X) or documents updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
Security screenings have also become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Trans people who have not undergone surgery should not expect to pass through the X-ray screen with integrity and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow from waves breaking off at the shore, often at a reef or similar.
The underwater topology causes the backflow to be concentrated to a few deeper parts, and strong currents leading to deep water can be formed there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion after attempting to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, it's no more difficult than normal to swim back in.
Try to aim for somewhere where you won't get stuck again or, depending on your skills and whether you've been detected, wait to be rescued.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (there is not as much of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had an easy time adjusting to new cultures sometimes have difficulty re-adapting to their original culture.
Upon returning from living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, because of the knowledge that travelers in a new country must adapt.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually you'll hear the sounds of tourists and vendors, and the sound and light story is just like a fairy tale.
The background is the Sphinx, which tells a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The Southern Hemisphere, discovered in 1819, is claimed by several countries and has the largest number of bases, sixteen of which are active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest island being King George Island with the community of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded crater of an active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
Peninsular rock here merges with the plateau and then re-accumulates to form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Range, which is divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has Antarctica's highest mountain, Vinson Massif, with a peak of 4,892 m (16,030 ft) at Mount Vinson.
In remote places without cell coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not generally a substitute for a mobile phone, since you must be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by vessels, including pleasure boats, as well as expedition vessels in need of remote data and voice.
Your local telephone operator should be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
Travel and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning a holiday.
This is particularly popular among recent graduates, who can take a year off before university without jeopardising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a sabbatical course abroad can actually increase the chances of getting into higher education in your home country.
Usually, a fee is charged for enrolling in these teaching programs.
Finland is very boat-friendly, and the land of the thousand lakes also has thousands of islands in its lakes and in its archipelagos.
In the archipelago and the lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
While the archipelago and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any pleasure hunting, smaller boats or even a kayak can offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the specifically Baltic cruises include a longer stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days while returning to sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore for boat trips, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises include the German capital Berlin in their brochures.As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and aversions to other things that so many people have.
Understanding how airplanes operate and what happens during flight can help some people to overcome a fear of the unknown or of being out of control.
Courier companies pay good money to deliver things quickly, and time is often very important when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they've sent things by air freight, on some routes, it could have taken days to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it to you faster was to send it as checked baggage, because airline regulations don't allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a lot of money for the privilege (or better yet, let your company do it for you).
However, this does not come at a cheap price: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy price for business and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no point in even looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travelers who are prepared to pay well for the privilege of traveling somewhere quickly and comfortably.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău, and the local language is Romanian, although Russian is commonly spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has been affected by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member state.
Economic relations have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failures of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
The city, known in historical times as Smyrna, is today a modern, developed city and a bustling commercial center situated on a huge harbor surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-faced buildings and modern shopping malls are mixed with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 17th-century market and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more like Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and has an unusual octagonal church.

Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, visit the magnificent Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a world-famous site for apparitions of Mary.
Remember that you are, in effect, visiting a mass grave and a place of almost unimaginable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive today who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones murdered or worked to death here; Jews as well as non-Jews.

The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish, with about half preferring to speak Catalan, a vast majority understanding it, and virtually all speaking Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, which is by law the primary official language.
However, Spanish is also used in many public transportation and other facilities.
Regular messages in the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned disturbances are communicated by an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
"Although this is often just a false stereotype, the best way to get around Paris is still to behave in the best way and behave like someone who is 'bien élevé' (well-behaved). It will make it much easier to get around".
The Parisian's Brutalist exterior will quickly fade if you show yourself from your polite side.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is thickly forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir trees, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a strikingly large arthrichoidity, due to the extent of microclimate, different moons and varying altitude differences.
The area is also home to an extremely diverse range of animal and bird species.
Rare animal species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lion, wildcat, and cheetah are found there, along with many more common species
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees, and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries give scarves to women who have not prepared for them in advance, but if you bring one of your own, especially one with bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
By the same logic, men should wear pants that cover their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the storage room in the lobby but the clothes are not washed after each person so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas around the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses permeable olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and optional available accessories such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the pronoun you, are written with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between certain verbs and objects.
Some say it also makes it easier to read, although the need to figure out whether a verb or adjective is in the noun form makes writing a little more complicated.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies based on the following vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means carriage, while carro means carriage.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, you can benefit from reading this basic grammar book to learn much about Persian grammar and to understand sentences better.
Of course, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese if you already know a Romance language.
But people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Predynastic observatories are generally obsolete today and survive as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution in its heyday was not the type of problem it is today, it is usually found in cities or on university campuses, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami, or the cherry blossom spectacle, has been a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were used.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural habitat, so try to resist the temptation to remove just one specimen.
"If you visit an arranged garden, and you pick up a 'example' it will also get you kicked out, without discussion".
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to live and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
"But with its location in the ""high tropics"" just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (all the time) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely)".
There are also a small number of buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure the bus you're thinking of taking goes to Hebron, not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.

Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christendom and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have even been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake in some open place to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter holiday, then break up at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands arrived by either swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the great distance from the mainland, mammals could not get over, and so the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since man arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic wintertime, you will experience polar nights, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good time to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is dark more or less around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is thus often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
Costumes are the standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or by job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with emphasis on the collective efforts rather than the achievements of individuals.
Often, employees must obtain the approval of their superiors for any decision they make and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without hesitation.
