This not only proves the already widespread theory that certain dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides more detail than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
Scientists say the animal's pelvis was chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development, since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or rachis, but do have other feather features - such as hooks.
The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that they were not used to fly, but to regulate temperature or what it looked like, and the researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this specimen shows adult feathers, not the tail of a chicken.
The researchers suggested that, despite the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen had the plumage of an adult and not the thunder of a chicken.

The community outcry resulted in the current efforts to craft a policy regarding sexual content from the site, which hosts millions of pieces of open-licensed media content.
The work completed was mainly theoretical in nature, but the program was written for the simulation of observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The team was looking for the effect that would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the universe and that of the galaxy.
Similar to the way the moon exerts force on the earth, leading to tides, the Milky Way exerts force on the Sagittarius constellation.
The researchers concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter in a galaxy is surrounded by a kind of circle, and it is made up of a large number of smaller particles.

"The thermal behavior of these is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth that often maintain a temperature that is fairly constant, which is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting traditionally requires little technology: voters go into a box and put a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope with the name of the candidate they are voting for.
Officials first check the identity of the voter, then the voter slips the envelope into the ballot box and then puts his signature under the ballot.
The process is relatively narrowly defined in the French electoral law.
Since 1988 ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added other than those of registered and authorised voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process, and volunteers count the votes at night under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services tried to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to Great Yarmouth, at James Paget Hospital.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been convicted at Edinburgh Sheriff Court for the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but the eyewitness account may be biased because her story has been widely published.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but the justice system in Scotland works differently and courts have labeled the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists play a dangerous game by publishing pictures and e.d. of suspects".
The Crown Office has overall charge of prosecutions and has informed journalists that no further statements will be made, at least until charges have been brought.
According to sources, the document refers to a settlement of the dispute, something the Palestinians wanted on the basis of the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed were the future status of Jerusalem, a city sacred to both nations, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for 10 years after the signing of the agreement, but the PA is only willing to maintain a five-year presence.
The additional pest control test required that the shooters be closely monitored by forest rangers, as the test was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
A collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc. recruited qualified volunteers for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four selected shooters for the first shooting operation have had extensive safety and training instruction.
Yesterday Martelly inaugurated a new nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP).
Martelly has been awarded CEP five times in the last four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the dismissal of the previous National Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to ensure new elections in the country.
The committee was set up by Martelly in response to the widespread anti-government protests that have taken place since October.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the absence of elections, some of which were due to take place as early as 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of faulty iPods overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of the 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating that the company called "not serious".
"Very regrettable", was the response from the ministry to Apple's delaying the report.
Mariana was hit by the earthquake at 07:19 local time (Friday 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Disaster Management Agency stated that no damage was reported nationwide.
In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
In Manila, the Philippine capital, a former Philippine police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six deaths have been confirmed.
Six hostages were released earlier, including the children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers returned in exchange for an elderly woman who had to go to the bathroom, and Mendoza was eventually shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and went into medicine.
Trained as an obstetrician, he joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins spent his spare time researching premature births.
His research showed that the maturation of fetal lungs of babies was accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" of flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first manager, Luna died on the night of the double moon, as unique as she was, a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels stated that "Luna was as weird as I was... maybe even weirder... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed for the 2010 federal election, the number of people who opposed Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, outgoing Prime Minister Julia Gillard said that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those polled supported this position, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
29 percent of those polled felt that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and at the other end 31 percent said that it should never happen.
The Olympic gold medalist swam the 100- and 200-meter freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his condition was called into question because of his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to ease his pain, because they're banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery in early February using various hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water coming to earth, along with organic matter that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially as comets have long since collided with the earth.
Cuomo, 53, was sworn in as governor earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the gossip "political nonsense and gossip".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
The FAA believes that the NextGen system could allow aircraft to take shorter routes, saving millions of tonnes of fuel annually for lower carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older technologies with ground-based radars, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much better, and they can provide pilots with clearer information.
No additional transport is used and no overhead trains stop at Wembley; in addition, parking and P&R are not accessible on site.
A possible lack of transport increased the likelihood that the match would be played behind closed doors and without fans.
A study published Tuesday in the scientific journal Science looked at the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations, a process thought to take much longer because it took longer to cross a native Darwin's finch, the Middle ground finch, with an immigrant Cactus ground finch, the Española ground finch.
Gold can be shaped into many shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a narrow thread that can be twisted and braided, or it can be forged or rolled into plates.
After it is made very thin, it can be pasted onto another metal, and it can even be made so thin that it was sometimes used to adorn hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you're already making an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the cabbage juice then changes based on the acidity (acidity to basicity or alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix the two dry powders together, wet and clean your hands, and make a ball of it.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Sewerage remains have been found in houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
In addition, toilets were in use in ancient China, Egypt, and Persia, and in the Roman era, they were often part of a public bathhouse, where both men and women met in a mixed group.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
As soon as the space satellite receives the call, it will be sent back immediately.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and image.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need a huge rocket that is more than 100 feet [30 m] long.
The wheel has changed the world incredibly, and the most important thing that the wheel has given us is easier and faster transportation.
The train, the car and many other means of transport are the result.
There are medium-sized felines among those medium-sized prey, from hares to antelopes to deer.
In addition, many small cats (such as domestic stray cats) prey on larger numbers of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their success stems from the idea of a niche, a special job that each cat has that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called troops.
Troops consist of one to three adult males that are related to each other and also have up to 30 females and cubs.
The women are normally closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pack of lions behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large cats) and are very lethal to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and have five times the traction of a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four felines are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger doesn't roar like a lion, it's more like he's grunting a whole sentence.
The ocelots' favorite food is small animals, which they catch when they can, such as monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and the ocelot preys almost exclusively on animals much smaller than itself.
Scientists suspect that ocelots use their sense of smell to hunt small animals (their prey) by sniffing the ground where they have been.
They have excellent night vision and can see in the dark and move around very subtly, and they hunt by fitting in with their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes detached from the large population from which they originate (for example, by moving across a mountain range or river, or if they are moved to another island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, other resources and other enemies are present, so the new population must start to set up or adapt to face the competition.
Because they still need the same adjustments as before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to look less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that you can't call them the same species.
This process is called speciation, and it simply involves the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in and they take in carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Through photosynthesis, plants get their nutrients from the sun and provide shade.
Our houses and our clothes are made of plants, we eat mostly plants, and without plants, animals wouldn't survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain at that time, and it had nothing to fear from anyone but other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws had over 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the palate, which means nothing or no one could escape him.
It's not certain, but it's possible that his tongue was forked, eating turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe even his own kind.
Water portions were not safe from attacks; even giant dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were not safe from him.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a sleeping mouse.
There was also another difference; poor people and women sat on chairs while eating, but rich men liked to have a banquet together where they reclined on their sides while eating.
Meals from Roman antiquity do not contain food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
They had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for all their gods, and this temple was considered the god's own house.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by organizing ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had a public courtyard and a back room that was accessible only to priests.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers were built as part of the temples, called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family was often outside.
Women cooked in the garden, shops were nothing more than street stalls, and stone was used to build houses.
The land of Canaan was not heavily forested, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and according to Norse legend, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on his way west, and named it after himself.
He made this discovery, but there were Eskimo tribes living there at the time.
Although all were 'Scandinavian' countries, the personalities, royal families, customs, and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark, and Norway were very different.
You might think after the movie National Treasure that there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's based on a misconception, because there's something written on the back, but it's not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original American Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one is sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large scroll (29 3⁄4 inches by 24 1⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage in the past.
So it looks like the designation was just added as a kind of label.
The D-Day landings and the fighting that followed liberated the north of France, but the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by Vichy France, these were Frenchmen who in 1940 sided with the Germans and so sided with the enemy instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France with Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated southern France in just two weeks, then they were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
From the Latin civilis, which means civil, comes the term civilisation, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state; and that also defines in a certain way the format of society.
City states are the forerunners of nations, and a civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed down through multiple generations, a lasting cultural footprint and balanced distribution.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence, and thus are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolution, thirteen states under the Articles of Confederation formed a weak central government, consisting of only a congress.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes because there was no national executive or judicial power and relied on state authorities for all decisions, who often refused to cooperate.
Nor did it have the power to ignore tax laws and tariffs between states.
First, all the states had to agree unanimously to the articles before they could be amended, but the states did not take the national government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with the German team, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, sword fighting, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are particularly popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to geographically as a "peninsula".
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when sailors from Europe passed by the island and named it Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC established itself in southwestern Taiwan as a base of operations, where the VOC took on the native grain production processes and employed Chinese workers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was incorporated as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, transferring sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Built of three large structures, Machu Picchu consists of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three-Winged Chamber.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they used to look like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the renovation is still underway.
For example, the most common still image format worldwide is 35 mm, which was the usual film format at the end of the analogue film era.
These are still produced today, although it is mainly the ratio of the image that the image sensor of the digital camera took over.
And what's really strange is that 35mm film is actually 36mm wide, and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this size (dividing by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) would then be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS-like formats) are equal to or close approximations of this image ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is widely abused and ridiculed by many, is a simple directive which makes the image dynamic, yet clear.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines, where you divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under attack.
For over a thousand years, Christianity united European states, despite differences in language and customs.
From the king to the common man, his pervasive power affected everyone.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to combat suffering and poverty, and the church has money resources for this reason.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this relationship of power and money led many people to question whether this principle was being followed.
Britain set up a blockade at sea against Germany shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective, as it was no longer possible to provide vital supplies to military and civilian personnel, but this blockade violated the generally accepted international law that has been enshrined in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has placed mines in international waters, making whole areas of the ocean unseaworthy, which was dangerous even for neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country's unrestrained undersea warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations had an attitude of pacifism and isolation.
After World War I, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever occurring again.
Tesla emigrated to the United States in 1884 to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he had only 4 cents, a volume of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each ruling family had a distinct dynasty.
The most famous was the Three Kingdoms period, which occurred in the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties in the late 19th century.
At that time, fierce wars were fought between various nobles vying for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the Three Kingdoms era is one of the bloodiest, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
The Revolution had major social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism, and the notion that the land belongs to its inhabitants rather than to a single leader.
After the revolution, positions were available to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
The same is true of the army, where rank is no longer based on class but on the caliber of the individual.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class in other countries to revolt.
Muhammad was intensely concerned with matters of the supernatural, often going to a cave later known as the Cave of Hira in the Noor Mountains for meditation.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave is located on one of the mountain peaks on the north side of Mecca and is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
Even if the cave was known to exist, it was not easy to find at all. Once inside the cave there is total isolation.
All you can see is the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains, and there's very little to see or hear from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world still standing.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C. and is one of the many large pyramid structures in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or 'Pyramids of Giza' in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, a number of temples, and the great sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the wives and relatives of Khufu.
The up-bow sign looks like a V and the down-bow sign looks like a notch or a square with the bottom missing.
Up means you start at the tip and push the rod away. Down means you start at the bow frog (the place where your hand holds the rod) and pull the rod.
An upward motion usually produces a softer sound, while a downward motion produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Feel free to sketch your personal symbols, but remember that the printed lines are there for a musical purpose, so they should usually be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a group of market women were behind the departure of the terrified Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese, 11 and Louis-Charles, 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris.
They rode back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by howling and threatening rioters who threatened the Royal Couple.
The actions of the crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, someone in the crowd held up the head of a royal guard who had been murdered at Versailles before the eyes of a terrified queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines have been paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to finance much of the cost, and the interest on bonds was issued through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
American imperialism was largely based on the enormous profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Philippines.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that gave rise to the Order.
The era in which this happened is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
After the early Middle Ages came the High Middle Ages, which were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which usually end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a wide range of ideas in practice: from technology supply or technological obligation to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic that is linked to scientific laws and their appearance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have these two general views: that the development of technology follows a path that for the most part goes beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has 'effects' on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, some may say that the arrival of the automobile automatically leads to the building of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically feasible for a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars also increases the number of road accidents and leads to the development of new health care techniques to restore the human body.
The Romantic movement incorporated a large part of cultural determinism, which came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic period, geography shaped the individual, and over time, customs and cultures developed from this geography, forming a harmonious society that was better than arbitrary laws.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, as Paris is the modern fashion capital.
It was known as an epicenter of luxury from about 400 AD to about 1100 AD.
The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned with silk and spices that were worth more than the Byzantine markets could provide.
Around this time, Paris also took over the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
Gothic celebrated its heyday in the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
Clothing was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture from the East.
However, because of the slow communication channels, styles in the West were 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the greatest developments was the result of the Crusades, when people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture where sufficient food is produced to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually organic, using stored seed from the ecoregion, combined with alternating crops or other relatively simple techniques to optimise yields.
In the past, most farmers worked in self-sufficient agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms, giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
A subculture may be defined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or one or more of these factors combined.
Members of a subculture often indicate which group they belong to through a certain symbolic style in what they wear, in how they behave, and in the jargon they speak.
One of the most widely used methods of illustrating the importance of socialization has been the few regrettable cases of children who were not socialized by adults because of neglect, adversity or deliberate abuse during their childhood.
Some wolf children have been imprisoned by humans (usually their own parents), sometimes abandoned because the parents did not want to accept the child's severe mental or physical limitations.
Untreatable children may have experienced severe child abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
A wild child who has not been raised by humans may exhibit behavior similar to the behavior of the animal that has raised the child (within physical limits), such as fear of or indifference to humans.
Project-based learning should simplify and make education more interesting, but scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals dealing with a new learning experience, for example a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, and a teacher is a form of support, but so is the Microsoft Office paper clipper.
There is a virtual scaffolding built into the software that asks questions, provides memory aids, and explains procedures that may be difficult for students to understand without help.
There are various reasons why children end up in foster care, such as neglect, abuse, and exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not well cared for, where they are not cared for and where they cannot develop, and yet this is happening.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe zone for these children.
The goal of foster care is to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care must meet all the needs that were neglected in the previous home.
The Internet is a combination of interpersonal and mass communication.
The different characteristics of the Internet lead to new dimensions in the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are suggested as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivational aspects such as 'personal involvement' and 'persistent relationships' when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to remarkable breakthroughs in interpreting micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
It is stated, in particular, that no one can recognize a lie by merely observing micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks described in his essay The President's Speech how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately assess its sincerity.
He even suggested that other animal species, such as domestic dogs, also possess the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
By mutation, new genetic variation is added; by selection, this variation is eliminated from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, there is variation between the two groups by means of separation and recombination.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans can find it difficult to obtain the amino acids needed from the plant sources found in the savanna.
Furthermore, failure to comply can have serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition and eventually even death.
The easiest sources of plant protein are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they're cooked, they're hard to digest for primates like us.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) easy to digest, but it also contains a very high amount of proteins, which contain all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their protein problem the same way chimpanzees in the savannah solved their problem today.
Sleep interruption means that you wake up for a reason during your normal sleep period and fall back to sleep within a short time (10-60 minutes).
This is quite easy by using a relatively soft alarm clock that brings you back to your consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you turn off your clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids before bed (and especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic), which will make you have to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner calm a person has is in contrast to the amount of stress a person carries in his or her body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force present. Every human being is able to achieve contentment and total peace.
Anyone can be or be a light in the mind, and only your own stress and negativity stand in the way of that goal.
Tibetan Buddhism has its roots in the teachings of Buddha, but this form of Buddhism has been expanded with the Mahayana path of love and with a number of techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation and a practice of universal love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini yoga is generated.
The essence of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as the focus, and by visualizing various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and the consciousness is brought into an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in World War II, cooperation between the USSR and the USA was established. When the war ended, the conflicts between system, process and culture caused the countries to quarrel with each other.
The former allies were facing each other two years after the war ended, marking the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last 40 years, and proxy armies would fight on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
The Polish defense forces only held out until 17 September 1939, after which they had to withdraw and reorganize along the bridgehead in Romania.
However, these plans were thwarted overnight when 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying eastern parts of Poland, in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty and other international peace treaties that were both bilateral and multilateral.
Freight transport by ship is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the task of the navy has been to ensure that a country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while at the same time preventing the enemy from transporting people and goods.
The U.S. was trying to get men and equipment across the Atlantic to the British, and this North Atlantic campaign of WWII is one of the most remarkable recent examples.
At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic, using mostly U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Britain would probably have fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.
It is said that the goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran some 10,000 years ago.
In ancient times, cultures and tribes began keeping them so that they could always easily obtain hair, meat, milk, and skins.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other pasture, and were then watched by goat herders, as was the more familiar shepherd, often a child or younger.
As early as the 16th century, horse railways were built in England.
Although horse railways consisted of only a rail of planks, the horses had to run faster and faster than on the somewhat difficult roads of the day.
While threshold beams were used early enough to hold the rails in place, it was gradually realized that rails would be more efficient if there was an iron point on top.
This soon became the common practice, but the iron resulted in more wear on the wooden carriage wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden variants, and in 1767 the first fully iron rails were laid.
The first form of transportation we know of is walking, and people started walking upright two million years ago, when Homo Erectus emerged.
Their ancestor, the Australopithecus, was less likely to walk upright.
In the fossils of the Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, bipedal specialization is found.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, join an environmental movement, or even take action to mitigate future suffering in some way.
In many cases, it's like symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to identify the root cause of the problem and eliminate it.
The scientific and technological advances of human society have clearly changed the earth dramatically, and overpopulation and extravagant human lifestyles have exacerbated the problems.
After the Declaration of Independence was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away, signed by Continental Congress President John Hancock and Secretary of State Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 were made overnight, these are now better known as "Dunlap broadsides".
John Nixon gave the first public reading of the document on July 8 in the garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York on July 9. Another copy arrived in London on August 10.
25 The Dunlap scrolls are the oldest surviving copies of the document, the original handwritten copy of which has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that there is one species of dinosaur that still exists today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still remind you of a dinosaur.
They have claws and scales on their legs, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulating data encoded in binary numbers forms the basis for almost all computers in use today.
A binary number can have only two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (and in computer language "bits").
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The presence of open-box medications or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific EHS instructions for that specific poison.
Entomologists formally call this group of insects "worms".
The term comes from a centuries-old association with bed bugs, which are insects that can parasitize humans very well.
Both red-headed and bed bugs are nest-bound, adapted to live in the nest or house of their host.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the leading neurological disorder in adults of both young and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or that of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to give their baby up for adoption.
In an adoption, the parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
Discovering how the world works through the scientific method is the main goal of science. This method is the guideline for most scientific research.
However, it is more than just experiments; an experiment is a test to rule out one or more potential assumptions, to question and to make observations, as a guideline for scientific research.
Physicists and philosophers turned to classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less as knowledge of Greek declined.
Physiological and behavioural observations of rhythms often have a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production via the biological clock.
Most creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, live by periodic rhythms, not just reactions to periodic external signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that cycle for a certain period of time, even when no external signals are being sent.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important pieces of evidence that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were carried out: one experiment marked the DNA in the bead with radioactive phosphorus, and the other experiment marked the bead protein with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material involved and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells are inherited, and other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who like to visit natural areas because they want to enjoy the landscape, including its flora and fauna.
On the spot, you can hunt, fish, take pictures, observe birds, visit parks, and study the ecosystem.
One example is a visit to, photographing and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small villages to their workplaces and pass people whose workplaces are in the village from which they just came.
Everyone on this dynamic transport shuttle is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science shows that this enormous carbon economy has left the biosphere out of the stable state that has allowed human evolution to take place over the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about it.
In developed countries, water quality problems or collapsing bridges are comparatively rare.
Why do transport systems have so many complaints, why do they go wrong every day, are transport engineers just incompetent, or is it something more fundamental?
A traffic flow looks at the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the individuals.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave reasonably predictably, which means that traffic flows show some degree of consistency and that there is something to be said about this mathematically.
The three key characteristics have been linked to better represent traffic flow: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate the planning, design and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape from enemies and to find food and mating partners more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings around the body.
This allows them to hide in a greater number of small places for predators.
At present, only dragonflies and moths are unable to fold their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
While some thought he was right, many people believed the opposite, that the solar system revolved around the Earth, and so did the Sun (and other stars).
This sounds pretty logical, because you don't feel the earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and second longest river, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, reaching six miles in width in some places.
Some 20 percent of all the water that flows into the sea through the rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main stream is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, draining from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in size and technical excellence.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was then over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and also the least populous.
Italian is the primary language for official communication and legislation in Vatican City.
Italian is the language most spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is widely used during religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times, because they are all found in nature and are fairly easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they transition into new substances to form what we see.
So, alloys are simply a combination of at least metals, and as you probably know, the periodic table contains a lot of elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are among the metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
Alloys may also contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that there are a trillion atoms that fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
That's why the pencil was a loyal friend to many people when it was launched.
The pen has unfortunately been reduced in status and much less used as newer writing methods have emerged.
Today, people write messages on a computer screen without ever needing a point-cutter.
You might wonder what's going to happen to the keyboard once something new comes on the market.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to make a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like a heavy wagon pushing up a hill, and when the core splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they break down at the slightest or the smallest.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more marins on the side, because the crust is thinner there, and lava could more easily get to the surface there.
Content theories are designed to find out what moves people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow up.
These theories are designed to explore the reasons why certain people want certain things and what environmental factors influence them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's need pyramid and Hertzberg's motivation-hygiene theory.
Generally, two patterns of behavior emerge when managers take over from their former colleagues: one is to try to present themselves as an equal.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and disciplinary measures, to conduct evaluation discussions, to delegate and to address people on their responsibility.
At the other end of the spectrum, he or she becomes an unrecognizable individual, and he or she feels like they have to change everything the team has done so far, and they want to own everything.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Often, this behavior leads to a rift between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as normal teams, although there are slight differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They are often more independent than traditional team members, and that's because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organisation want to embark on the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
Creativity and ingenuity are shown when all available resources are effectively used within the functional departments of an organisation.
The result is that the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
To enable innovation in an organisation, management must foster a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
According to Angel (2006), organisations can perform better with an approach based on the continuum model.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition, which can reduce the scope of research and allow more accurate data to be collected.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is helping scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, trauma, wounds, and tumors can affect behavior and lead to changes in mental ability.
As more and more new technologies are introduced, we are learning more and more about the structures and processes of the brain.
This gives us a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that will give us a better understanding of the processes of our minds.
AI reminds most people of science fiction, but it's also an essential part of computer science, and it's used in research into machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior is a topic of AI research.
Some examples are management, planning, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to real-life problems.
Today, this artificial intelligence system is widely used in economic, medical, technical and military fields, such as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
Many field trips are planned for each class, and often a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Thanks to technological advances, virtual tours are now possible, allowing students to view artifacts in a museum, look inside an aquarium, or see beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing a virtual tour is also a great way to look back on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital, which is redesigned every year and previous versions of which are kept online to serve as a flyer.
Blogs can also help students to write better, and often their grammar and spelling are bad at first, but quickly change as they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve his writing and thus avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to learn more about the world around them". The need to keep the public interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
When used correctly, blogs can 'help students develop analytically and think critically; by actively engaging in the discussion on the Internet, students can find their own place in the context of other people's material and at the same time determine their own point of view on certain issues' (Oravec, 2002).
Canada's bilingual capital is charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and future.
Further south, you find Niagara Falls, and further north, you find the beautiful, unspoiled Muskoka and more.
These are the kinds of things that make Ontario Canadian to outsiders.
Further north, large areas are rather sparsely populated and some of these areas are even virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A demographic comparison that may surprise many is that there are more African-Americans living in the United States than in Canada as a whole.
The East African islands lie along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of fauna, it is almost a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought with them the Islamic faith, which spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the shipping route from Europe to India, marking the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region is bordered on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean and on the north by the Sahel.
Women: Female travelers are advised to say they are married, whether or not that is true.
It also helps to change rings (not too expensive-looking rings).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to behaviour that they find intimidating and that it is common to be followed, to be caught by the arm, etc.
Be clear when you reject a man and don't be afraid to stand up for your man (cultural differences don't talk this way!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. The city was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids and was known under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the port and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but after an earthquake in 1755, they abandoned the city.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Bayad, and the Spanish traders who established their trading base here called it Casablanca.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina, you can find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pots, leather goods, water pipes and other luxury items, but it is purely geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is located in the far east of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, which spewed lava and covered most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, before visiting outside Goma, check the status of the fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for the climb of Nyiragongo volcano and offers some of the most profitable mountain gorilla tracking trips in Africa.
Boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi) is a way to get around Goma, with a normal (local) price of around 500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
"Timboektoe" is relatively difficult to access and is therefore used today as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation as a tourist attraction and airport makes it a haven.
In 1990, because of desert storms, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger.
It was one of the main stops of the PBS show Henry Louis Gates's Special Wonders of the African World.
The city differs from other cities in the country in that it has a more Arab than African feel.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east, along the border with Zimbabwe in the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park is 19,500 square miles, divided into 14 different ecozones, where various wildlife species are kept.
As a major attraction in South Africa, this park is the showpiece of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily maintenance fees and entrance fees.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which gives you access to certain parts of South Africa's parks or to all national parks in South Africa.
The whole territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, which is considered by many tourists to be the most important place.
The large number of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering bar graph that is visible from the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, you leave the island and head for the waterfront of Kowloon on the other side.
The vast majority of the population of Hong Kong Island lives very close together on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British settlers settled, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world, extending 50 miles [80 km] from the coast to the Indian and Bengali hinterlands.
The Sundarbans are now officially included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part within the Indian borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are more than just mangrove swamps - they also contain some of the last mighty patches of jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which one third is swampland.
The Sundarbans have been a game reserve since 1966, and the area is now home to an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 Axis bears.
During the day, buses depart from the station at the border of the districts (across the river), most departing between 6.30 and 7.30 am, mainly in the direction of the east and Jakar/Bumthang.
It is wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance, since the regional buses are often full.
Most neighborhoods have small Japanese Coaster buses that are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis allow quick and comfortable travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French Guianese city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers are 83 metres high. The building is 378 metres long and has two aisles with a width of 3.50 metres.
The bridge is 15 metres above the ground and was completed in August 2011, but was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017 and is expected to be ready for use by the Brazilian customs posts.
The Guarani were the most notable indigenous group, living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also engaged in self-sufficient agriculture.
In the Chaco province, other indigenous tribes lived, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who found their food by hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Paraguay, formerly known as "the great province of India", was founded in the 16th century when Spanish colonists encountered the native population.
A three-century period of Spanish colonization followed.
Asunción was founded in 1537, and since then Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year will take place on the half-court in Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and competitions are also held here.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information on tournaments and buying tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is approximately equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands, in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store, where you can exchange money.
Generally, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley you can often pay with credit cards and US dollars.
In remote islands, you probably can't pay with a credit card, but you can probably pay with British and American currency.
Change your money before you leave the islands, because Falkland currencies are very difficult to change outside.
Montevideo is below the equator, so when it's summer there, it's winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics, and in the summer months temperatures can easily exceed +30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature almost never goes below zero, but the wind combined with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
Rainfall remains roughly constant throughout the year, with no distinct 'wet' and 'dry' periods.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are just wild after all, so they shouldn't be fed or tampered with.
In the park, keep at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards away from any other wildlife.
Elks, bison, reindeer, bears, and just about any other large animal can attack you, no matter how tame they may seem.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep proper distance, and these animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia, and the city of nearly 40,000 is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded around 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port, which became known as the infamous stalemate.
With the exception of one British battleship, all ships were sunk, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the struggle for independence by the Mau movement, the supreme leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, died at a failed peaceful rally in the city.
There are many beaches, especially because of Auckland's two harbours.
The North Shore beaches in the North Harbour district stretch north to south along the Atlantic Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most have pohutukawa trees that provide shade.
At Waitemata's harbour, in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in central Auckland, you will find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family-friendly beaches are sometimes crowded and offer good shopping along the coast.
'Number One' is the main local beer which is not a complex beer but is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australia may be better suited for travel.
The local drinking water is simply safe to drink, but bottled water is also easy to find if you don't trust it.
A flat white is a strange concept to Australians: black coffee is espresso, cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate milk is Belgian quality, and the fruit juices are expensive, but they're great.
Excursions to the reef take place year-round and injuries from these excursions are rare.
Nevertheless, seek expert advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
Cubic clams occur from October to April near beaches and estuaries north of Town of 1770, and sometimes outside this period.
Sharks do occur, but they rarely attack humans, and most of them are afraid of humans and would rather swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton and they do not normally live in the ocean.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind, knowing that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually book other forms of accommodation, such as a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transportation to and from the airport, and sometimes even packages with flight and hotel.
They can also hold you back if you want to think about the offer a little longer or if you need to obtain documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have a request or wish to make a change, you should do so through the travel agency rather than the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should be early to get a campsite near the music.
And remember: Even after the music on the main stage has ended, music may be played into the late hours in other parts of the festival grounds.
For families with young children, special camping sites are available at some festivals.
Be careful where you sit when crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, because the journey through the ice makes a huge noise if you get too close.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time to explore the city.
Casinos usually try to make the most of the time and money spent by guests, and windows and clocks are usually not present, and the exit may be difficult to find.
They normally have special offers on food, drink and entertainment to keep them in good spirits and to prevent them from leaving.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages, but when people are drunk, it affects their judgment, and all seasoned gamblers know that it is extremely important to stay sober.
If you are going to climb high into the mountains or ride over mountain passes, you should consider that there may be snow or ice and the temperature may be extremely low.
On icy and snowy roads there is little friction and it drives on it unlike asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to get stuck.
The visibility may also be impaired by falling or rising snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windscreen.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries and do not impede traffic.
The biggest tourist attraction in Africa is safari, which for many visitors is the highlight of their trip.
The term safari refers in popular usage to trips over land to view the beautiful African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often get close to cars, and standard equipment allows for good views.
If you want to see lions, cheetahs, and leopards, you need binoculars, or you're unlikely to see them.
A walking safari (also called a 'forest walk' or 'walk safari') involves walking for several hours or days in a row.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some of the games will be played at other venues in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Olympics twice, the first time in 1964.
If you've booked flights and accommodations for 2020 before the delay was announced, you could be in a penny situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets for events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000.
You can dry wet clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available. You can often borrow these items, even if they are not in the room.
If no ironing iron is available or if you do not want to wear ironing socks, you can also use a hair dryer if available.
Make sure that the substance does not overheat (this may cause the substance to shrink or, in extreme cases, to burn).
There are many ways to purify water, and some of them are effective in addressing specific risks.
In some areas it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, in other areas water must be boiled for several minutes.
Not all filters are as effective, so if in doubt, drink the best water from a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are not present in their own country.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poisons, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that violently injure or kill humans, are not normally considered pests.
Tax-free shops are places where you can buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travelers going to countries with high excise taxes can sometimes save considerable money on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected by the Buffalo-Pittsburgh freeway, so you often drive through abandoned backcountry, and that makes this one big challenge.
If you're not used to driving on dirt roads, keep your head down, you'll run into a lot of steep slopes, narrow streets, and steep turns.
The set maximum speeds are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent areas  usually around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and it is even more important to stick to them here than otherwise.
Surprisingly, you have a lot more range here than at other corners of the route, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries taste fine, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, as is the pastries of their southern neighbor, Austria.
You see a lot of fruit cakes, and throughout the year, the cakes contain apples, and in the summer months, cherries and plums.
Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and taste great with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but powerful pastries, try some that are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen in the region.
To make curry, you need spicy and spicy ingredients, combined with vegetables or meat.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be "dry" or "wet".
Inland northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
Indonesian cuisine includes dishes from 17,000 islands and is an overarching concept for a variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
But without further information, the term refers to the food originally from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
The most common Javanese flavorings are nuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic herbs.
Ascent braces support the rider's feet and hang downwards on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but they can also cause safety problems by trapping a rider's feet.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but his foot remains stuck in the climb, he can be dragged along with the horse.
Most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole at first.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety brackets that allow a climb-back guard to be released from the saddle when it is pulled backward by a rider falling from the horse.
Cochamó Valley - This is the most popular climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, and has many different large granite walls and rocks.
The mountaintops offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes on the walls that seem to have endless potential.
Winter downhill sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular, and you slide down a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard at your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums", planning entire holidays around skiing at a particular location.
Skiing has been around for a very long time. There are cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 B.C.
The beginnings of skiing date back to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Backpacking with skis: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It's not exactly the same, but it's like alpine skiing or mountain climbing, which is done a lot on steep terrain, and you need much more rigid skis and boots for that.
You can think of the skir route as a walking route.
Under good conditions, you can cover greater distances than you can on foot, but it is rare to reach the speed of cross-country skiing on paved trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries.
The Schengen area, however, operates in this area almost as one country.
As long as you are in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to undergo a passport check again.
If you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what is considered antique, and some tax offices define antique goods as being more than 100 years old.
The definition may vary from one location to another, for example in North America the age limit is lower than in Europe.
It is possible to label handicraft products as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Among the Sámi, reindeer herding is an important form of livelihood, and the culture of trade is very important for many with other occupations.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, which involved fishing, hunting and other activities, and where reindeer were usually used as draught animals.
Many Sámi now work in modern occupations.In Sápmi, the Sámi area, tourism is an important source of income.
The word 'Gypsy' is used mainly by non-Roma, but is also often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of the Roma.
If the country you are going to has a travel advisory, this may affect your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.
You can also consult the advice of other authorities, but their advice is directed to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions are only a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
They often give a vague, general and extremely simplistic picture compared with other, more detailed sources.
Emergency is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, severe social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of weather that vary based on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Signs and effects of severe weather include high winds, hail, heavy rainfall, forest fires, and thunderstorms, tornadoes, hailstorms, and hurricanes.
Snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms are examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather events.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks of severe weather in their area, as it may also affect some travel plans.
Anyone who wants to visit a country that is considered a war zone should be professionally trained.
A search for "course in hostile environments" on the Internet will likely give you the address of a local business.
A course normally covers all the issues set out in more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and consists of role-playing, lots of EHBO and occasional weapons training.
There are many books and magazines with articles on survival in the wilderness, but there are few publications on war zones.
Travellers who have planned a sex-off abroad should ensure that they have the correct documentation for the return journey.
It varies widely whether governments want to issue passports that do not state gender (X), or whether they want to update a name or gender on documents.
There is just as much difference in the willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents.
Moreover, since 11 September 2001, security checks have become much more extensive.
Transgender individuals who have not undergone surgery can assume that they will not pass through this scan with their privacy and dignity intact.
Mouse streams are the recurrent flow of waves that break up on a reef or similar and flow onto the beach.
Because of the underwater topology, the return current is located in some deeper parts, where a rapid flow into deep water can occur.
Most of the deaths are due to fatigue from trying to swim against the current.
Once you've escaped the strong current, swimming back is like this.
Try to focus on a place where you won't get caught again, and depending on your skills and whether you're noticed, you might as well wait for help.
The shock of returning is worse than the culture shock (you have a less honeymoon feeling), it lasts longer, and it can be more intense.
Travelers who are easily adapted to new cultures sometimes find it difficult to adjust to their own culture.
If you have lived abroad and then returned, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your own culture.
In the past, when you went abroad, you would find that people were patient and understanding, understanding that travelers had to adjust to a new country.
Patience and understanding are not usually expected for travelers returning home.
For children, the pyramid show with light and sound is one of the most interesting activities in the neighborhood.
You see the pyramids in the dark and you see them in all the silence before the show starts.
Often, the sound of vendors and tourists is heard here all the time.
The Sphinx is the backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes appear as projections on the pyramids and the rest of the pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have since been claimed by several countries.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula.
Others are Livingston Island and Deception, where you'll find the full-flowing crater of an active volcano that serves as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is on the southern side of the peninsula, bordering the Bellingshaus Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula pass into the plateau, and then emerge again to form the 200-mile-long [360 km] Mount Ellsworth, which is crisscrossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif, at 4,892 meters (14,090 ft).
A satellite phone may be your only option in remote locations where there is no cell phone reception.
A satellite phone is not really a replacement for a mobile phone, since you have to stand outside with clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, and for expeditions requiring external data and communication.
Your local telephone company can give you more information on how to connect to this service.
It's becoming increasingly popular for people who plan a gap year to travel and learn.
The most frequent use of this is for school leavers to take a break before university without detrimental consequences for their education.
Often, enrolling in a study abroad course during a gap year can increase your chances of returning to higher education in your own country.
Normally, tuition fees are charged for these educational programmes.
Finland is a fantastic destination for sailing, and the 'Land of a Thousand Lakes' also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the island groups off the coast.
A yacht is not necessary for the archipelago or lakes.
The coastal archipelagoes and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak, you get a completely different experience.
In Finland, so many people sail in their spare time that the ratio of boats to people is one in seven or eight.
The figure is similar to that of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is also quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include a long stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
You can spend a few full days in the historic site and spend the night on the ship.
Since 2009, you do not need a separate visa if you only go ashore on a boat trip.
Some cruises include a visit to the German capital Berlin, but as you can see on the map, Berlin is not close to the sea.
Air travel can be scary for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's not unlike many fears that other people have.
Knowing how airplanes work can help to remove a fear of the unknown or of not being in control of the plane.
Courier companies are generously compensated for delivering items quickly, and time is often a very important factor when it comes to business documents, merchandise or spare parts for necessary repairs.
Larger companies could use their own aircraft for certain routes, but for other routes and smaller companies it became more difficult.
If they're sending things by air, it can take days on some routes for them to get unloaded and through customs.
Only checked baggage could be processed more quickly, because airline rules require a passenger to be present, and that's you.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to count down a bag of money for this privilege (or better yet, have your employer do it).
But this is not cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times for business class, and about 11 times for first class.
It is usually pointless to look for discounts on business or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know all too well that there is a group of pilots who are willing to pay a lot of money to fly somewhere fast and comfortable, and the airlines charge corresponding fees for this.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău, where the Romanian language is spoken, but Russian is also widely spoken.
As a multi-ethnic republic, Moldova was plagued by ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by UN members.
Economic ties have been reestablished between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the largest port next to Istanbul and a good traffic hub.
The once ancient city of İzmir is now a modern, developed and busy commercial center on a bay surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass buildings and the modern shopping malls covered with red tiles, the 18th-century markets, the old mosques and churches, yet the city feels more like a Mediterranean European city than a traditional Turkish one.
In the village of Haldarsvík, you can enjoy views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, as well as a special church with eight corners.
Some tombs near the church have fascinating marble dove sculptures.
If you have half an hour, you should definitely look around this village.
To the north is the easily accessible, romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron praised the beautiful monuments there.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stopover in Cabo da Roca.
Also head north and see the magnificent Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (a temple complex), where internationally renowned Marian apparitions have taken place.
Remember, you are not only visiting a mass grave but also a place that has an almost immeasurable significance to a large part of the world's population.

During your visit, show all appropriate respect, solemnity and dignity.
Do not damage the site by placing markings or graffiti on the buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority can understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most of the signs are in Catalan, since that is the first official language according to the law.
Spanish is spoken in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are made by an automated system in several languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English and also in Japanese.
The people of Paris are known to be selfish, rude and arrogant.
Although this is usually just a misguided stereotype, it doesn't hurt to put your best foot forward in Paris and behave like someone who is 'bien élevé' (well-behaved), which will make it a lot easier to explore Paris.
The tough exterior of the Parisians quickly fades when you show that you're familiar with their way of doing things.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested and this wooded area consists mainly of beech, spruce and pine trees, and includes a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
There are many different plant communities, due to the different microclimates, the different soil types and the varying altitude differences.
This area is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat, and the owl are to be found, along with many more common species.
When women visit a monastery, they are required to wear a skirt up to their knees and must have their shoulders covered.
Usually, you get a wrapper as a woman if you arrive unprepared at a monastery, but if you bring your own copy, with nice, screaming colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile kindly.
On the other hand, men should wear pants at least to the knees.
You can borrow them from the store at the entrance, but these clothes aren't washed every time afterwards, so you might not feel comfortable with that.
Like many other Mediterranean regions, Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses a lot of olive oil.
A simple and popular dish for dinner, especially during the summer months, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and whatever is available from flavorists, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Nouns, like "sie" which means "you", always have a capital letter at the beginning, even if they're in the middle of the sentence.
This way you make a pronoun distinction between a number of verbs and objects.
It probably makes reading easier, but writing is more complicated, because you have to figure out whether to use a verb or an adjective as a noun.
Most Italian words are written exactly as they are pronounced, so the pronunciation is generally not a problem.
You should pay most attention to the C and the G, because their pronunciation depends on the vowel that follows them.
You also have to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means sweetheart, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and usually regular grammar.
So reading this introduction to grammar will teach you much about the grammar of Persian and help you to understand sentences.
It's quite logical that if you know a Romance language, it's easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But people who speak a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is so similar to this that you don't have to learn it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now obsolete, serving as museums or educational attractions.
Light pollution wasn't as big a problem then as it is now, so they were often built in cities or on campus, more accessible than they are today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the sight of cherry blossoms and it's been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flowers and that's where the concept came from.
Japan's first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor and were reserved for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural environment, so you have to suppress the tendency to remove even 'just one' species.
If you collect samples while visiting a landscaped garden, you are immediately and without question denied access to the garden.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, very easy to navigate and almost everything is available upon arrival.
But if you are in the 'high tropics,' just a few degrees north of the equator, you experience both heat (always) and strong sun (less often when the sky is clear).
There are also some buses heading north to Hebron, the legendary burial place of the Bible patriarchs Isaac, Jacob, Abraham, and their wives.
Make sure the bus you're taking is actually going into Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good holiday destination.
For example, you can visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise to the interesting towns along the Danube, or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also list popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Moreover, non-Christian people in Christendom and non-Christians around the world have adopted many of the traditions that are part of the holiday.
There's a tradition where you stay up all Easter night until you can see the sunrise at some point.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian springtime and fertility ritual.
In traditional churches, Easter vigil is often held on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend, with the congregations often celebrating a feast in honor of Christ's resurrection at about midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or floating.
The distance from the mainland made the journey impossible for mammals, making the giant tortoise the most common grazing mammal in the Galapagos Islands.
Since man's arrival on the Galapagos, all kinds of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
During winter, the Arctic and Antarctic regions experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not actually rise.
There is a good chance that you will be able to see the aurora borealis, since the sky will be more or less dark day and night.
The areas are sparsely populated and so light pollution is not often a problem.
The Japanese work environment is more structured and formal in nature than in the Western world.
Suits are standard workwear and colleagues call each other by their surname or function name.
Unity in the workplace is crucial, the focus is on group performance rather than individual performance.
Employees often need to get their supervisor's permission before they can make a decision, and they are expected to follow the supervisor's instructions thoughtlessly.
