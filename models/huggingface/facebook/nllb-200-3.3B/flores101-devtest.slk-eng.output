Not only does this confirm the already widely held theory that at least some dinosaurs were bent, but it also provides details on what fossils generally could not have been, including color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's fur was chestnut brown on top, pale or carotenoid on the underside.
The find also provides a detailed look at the development of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur's feathers lack a well-developed skeleton called a rachis, but have other features of feathers  spines and rays , scientists have concluded that the rachis probably evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature control or courtship.
Although it is a tail of a young dinosaur, the scientists say that the feathers on the specimen are those of an adult, not those of a baby.

The work they did was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team expected would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth, causing tides to rise and fall, so does the Milky Way's gravitational pull on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have found that the interaction of one dark matter with another dark matter is the same as that of ordinary matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around the galaxy is found around the galaxy in a kind of glow and is made up of lots of small particles.

They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) astrogeological team, also at the University of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been at a low technological level: Voters took themselves to a separate area and put a pre-printed sheet of paper with the name of their candidate in the envelope.
Once the officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter will place the envelope in the ballot box and sign the ballot paper.
The French electoral law has a fairly strict codification of procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are inside at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added except those which are carried by duly verified and counted voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness the entire process, and in the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision in accordance with specific procedures.

Until the emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT, the road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Then Adekoya was charged by the Sheriff's Court in Edinburgh with the murder of his son.
She's in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence could be lost because her image has been published on a large scale.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary operates differently and the courts consider the publication of the photographs to be potentially biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee claims that 'journalists are taking a dangerous route when they publish photos of suspicious people'.
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for criminal prosecution, has indicated to reporters that it will not comment further on the case until at least charges are brought.
The document is said to be related to a border dispute demanded by Palestine over the state of the borders before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future state of Jerusalem, which is considered sacred by both nations, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel has a requirement for a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years after the agreement is signed, while Palestine agrees to maintain such a presence for a period of five years only.
The shooters in the complementary pest control test had to be under strict forestry supervision as the test was monitored and its effectiveness was assessed.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the NPWS's Conservation and Heritage Park, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly yesterday installed a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
That's Martelly's fifth CEP in the last four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the pre-agreed resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests have been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some since 2011.
There were about 60 reported cases of faulty iPod overheating, which together caused six fires and four people suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week, the government agency METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
The Ministry responded by calling the postponement of Apple's report 'really regrettable'.
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday at 9:19 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time).
The Office of Emergency Management for the Northern Mariana Islands stated that no damage was reported in the country.
According to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there is no indication that a tsunami is about to hit.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza was shooting tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Along with the Filipino photographers, six hostages, including children and elderly persons, were also released early.
Then the photographers took over the place after an old lady needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began his medical career.
He trained as a midwife and in 1959 began work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that administering the hormone would accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two flight recorders, the so-called "black boxes", on Wednesday.
The warriors also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. She was my first manager. She died in the night two months ago, which was as original as she was. She was a strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented: "The moon was as crazy as I am... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's doing well up there".
From the 1,400 people who took part in the poll before the 2010 federal election, the number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard communicated her belief that Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of respondents share the view that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last Australian monarch.
At the extreme, 29 percent of those surveyed think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, doubts were raised about his fitness.
He couldn't take the pain medication he needed because it's banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people had confirmed the invention using other hardware and software by early February, and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water supply to the Earth, along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill that legalizes same-sex marriage.
He called the gossip "political chatter and folly".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says allows planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions every year.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to the older technology based on ground-based radars, which allows air traffic controllers to more accurately identify the aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There is no other form of transport, no overhead trains stop at Wembley, and no car parks or park-and-ride facilities.
Concerns about the lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
On Thursday, Science magazine published a study that reported the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Scientists at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that a new species has evolved over two generations, although it was believed that the process would take much longer, by crossing the endemic Darwin's finch Geospiza fortes with the migratory cactus finch Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into many shapes, including small rolled forms.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be rotated and folded.
It can be made very thin and can be glued to another metal, it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-made pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
It's called a pH chemical, and the indicator can be made using the juice of red cabbage.
The juice of cabbage changes color according to how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of electrons (because hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders together and then use your clean, wet hands to make a ball.
The moisture in your hands will begin to react with the outer layers, resulting in a strange feeling and the formation of a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets connected to a sophisticated sewage system in almost every home.
Remains of the sewer system have been found in the homes of Greek Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were commonplace, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were mixed together in society.
To talk to someone who's thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call, which is then almost immediately reflected back down to Earth.
Space scientists use telescopes because the earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and field of view.
To get a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a giant rocket, over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the most important thing it has brought us is much easier and faster transportation.
This has resulted in trains, automobiles, and many other forms of transportation.
Below them are other medium-sized feline predators that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat much larger prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niches, or specific areas or roles that each of the creatures has to fill, which prevents competition between them.
Lions are the most social of the cat-like predators, living in large groups called swarms.
The colony consists of one to three related adult males and up to thirty males and their offspring.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion carcasses behave like wolf or dog carcasses, which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other feline predators).
A well-trained athlete, Tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump for great distances, and pull five times as hard as a powerful man.
The tiger is in the same group as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, and these four cats are the only ones that can bark.
The tiger roar is not like a lion's roar with a mighty voice, but rather like a few hoarse words shouted.
Ocelots love to eat small animals, occasionally catching monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, but the vast majority of the animals they hunt are considerably smaller.
Scientists believe that ocelots track down and seek out animals that can be eaten (taken for food) by smell and by sniffing at the places they have been.
They have very good night vision and they also move very discreetly. Camels hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then diving into the prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) breaks off from the main population from which they originated (such as when they move across a mountain or river, or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily get back), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the original one.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be strong competitors, compared to what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
As time goes on, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like members of other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they can't be called the same species.
The name of this process is speciation, which means just the development of new species, and speciation is an unconditional outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in and take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants produce food from the sun by means of photosynthesis.
We use plants to build our homes, to make our clothes, and most of what we eat comes from plants, and animals couldn't survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its day, so it was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were set with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set of teeth in the lower jaw, which meant there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it could have had a tongue with a forked shape, it could have fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it could have even been cannibalistic.
It also attacked everything that entered the water, and even a giant dinosaur like the Tyrannosaurus rex couldn't match it.
While many of their dishes would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual dishes at banquets, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a species of rodent called the plch.
Another difference was that poor men and women ate sitting down on chairs, whereas rich men preferred communal feasts, at which they ate while reclining on their sides.
Ancient Roman dishes certainly could not have contained ingredients that did not reach Europe from America or Asia until centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple to each of their gods, which was considered the home of the deity.
The people used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which could be entered only by the priests.
Sometimes temples included specially built pyramid-shaped towers, called zikkurats.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
The house was not that substantial in the warm climate of the Middle East.
For most of its life, an ordinary Hebrew family lived in the open.
Women cooked in the courtyard, shops were just countertops facing the street, and houses were built with stone.
The land of Canaan was devoid of extensive forests, making timber extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the Scandinavian sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found a new land and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland are "Scandinavian" countries, there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and history.
If you've seen the movie, The Templar Treasure Hunt, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence was a treasure map.
Even if there is a writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence was inscribed with the words The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776. The text is found in the lower part of the document, inverted.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its early days a large parchment document (about 75 by 22 inches [75 by 23 by 22 cm] in size) was rolled up for storage.
It is therefore likely that the record was used only to mark the document.
The Normandy landings and the ensuing battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces liberated the south of France and turned on Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant number of people who live and work cooperatively as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and this word is related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state, and that also in a way defines the size of society.
Civilizing culture brings with it the transmission of knowledge across several generations, the continuation of the cultural footprint and the uniform expansion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and therefore cannot be recognised as true civilizations.
During the American Revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, whose only component was Congress.
Congress had no power to tax, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, Congress relied on the state to enforce all its laws, but they often failed to cooperate.
Nor did it have any authority to rewrite the laws of taxation and tariff between the states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international events and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the grouping of islands that Japan has, from a geographical point of view, Japan is often considered to be a  archipelago
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing around the island spelled it Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company builds a base in southwestern Taiwan, begins transforming native grain cultivation practices, and employs Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) gained control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894  1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three basic structures, namely the Intihuatany, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1975, and restoration continues to the present.
For example, the most common photo format worldwide is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still made today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensors of digital cameras.
In fact, the 35 mm format has a surprising width of 36 mm and a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this format, divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers, is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS group of formats) equal or come close to this aspect ratio.
Very often used, but also ridiculed, is the simple rule of thirds, which creates dynamics while maintaining the balance of order in the image.
He argues that the most effective place for the main subject is on the diagonal lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church came under scrutiny, became wealthy, and gained power.
For more than a millennium, Christianity has held European nations together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from kings to common people.
A central Christian principle is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's funds should be used for these purposes.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether its principles were being followed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective because it managed to disrupt vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain conditioned international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire parts of the ocean, which posed a danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was only minimal response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations.
When the world saw the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations were eager to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He came to the U.S. with four cents, a book of poetry and a letter from his former employer, Charles Batchelor, who recommended him to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting different time periods; each historical period of China or each family that was in power was a dynasty that made its mark on history in a significant way.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which existed for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times, a fierce war raged between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, and thousands of people died fighting for supremacy in the great palace of Si-an.
Many social and political phenomena are explored, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from autocracy to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
Even after the revolution, jobs were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true for the military, because instead of having military ranks based on class, they have gone to caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond earthly life, often going to meditate in the cave that became known as Hira, on Mount Noor (the light).
The cave itself, which has survived for a long time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Lying on top of one of the hills north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to get to it, even if you know where it is, because once you are in a cave, you are completely isolated.
There is nothing to see but a clear, beautiful sky and a number of surrounding mountains, and very little of this world is seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramidal structures erected in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the Giza necropolis, is located in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead. It is home to several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the wives of Cheops and members of his family.
The 'up' is a V-shaped mark and the 'down' is a square or square without a bottom.
Top means you should start at the tip and press on the bar, while bottom means you should start at the frog (the place where you hold the bar with your hand) and pull the bar.
The top of the bow usually produces a softer sound, while the bottom of the bow is firmer and more durable.
You can write down your own tracks, but remember that the printed notes are there for musical reasons, so you should usually keep them.
On October 6, 1789, the mob drove the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Mary Theresa, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, out of Versailles back to Paris.
They were driven back to Paris in a carriage, accompanied by an angry mob of screaming people who threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the carpet windows wide open.
In an instant, someone in the crowd waved the head of the royal guard that had been beheaded at Versailles.
The war costs of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime in the United States to pay for the bulk of the spending and interest on the bonds on behalf of the Philippine government, which they funneled through the banking houses to Wall Street.
It is clear that the enormous profits made by the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people have been the main source of income for American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context in which the order was founded.
The period when these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries of European history.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, the end of which is generally dated to about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of notions from the development of new technologies or technological imperative to its narrow meaning that human destiny is governed by the logic of scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself goes a way that goes far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology "impacts" societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be argued that motor vehicles inevitably lead to road development.
However, a nationwide road network for only a few cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Massive car ownership also leads to higher road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in health care to heal injured bodies.
An important element of Romanticism was cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time, geography-related customs and cultures were formed that were consistent with society and were better than arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is now considered the fashion capital of Europe, Constantinople was during the feudal period.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxus began sometime around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined over the course of the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned and brought gifts such as silk and spices, and these were worth more than what was offered in Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
From the beginning, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, the Western styles may have lagged 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest achievements of the time, brought by the Crusades, was the button.
Subsistence farming is farming carried out for the purpose of producing the quantity of food needed exclusively for the subsistence of the farmer and his family.
Self-source farming is a simple, often organic system that uses self-source seed  originating from an ecoregion  in combination with the seedling method or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be characterized by age, ethnic origin, social class, geographical location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a distinct subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through the expressive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on a number of unfortunate cases of children who were neglected, unhappy, or intentionally abused and not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Some unruly children were restricted by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the parents abandoned the child because they could not cope with his severe intellectual or physical impairment.
Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are said to have raised animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When a feral child is raised by animals other than human beings, it has a behavior (in physical confinement) that is almost identical to that of a particular animal, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the 'scaffolding' strategy goes further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a tool that helps people who encounter new experiences in learning, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The 'solutions' can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is also a form of 'solutions' but it is also a small office plug in Microsoft Office.
The virtual classrooms are internalised in the software, and are primarily designed to challenge and explain procedures that are too complex for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect, abuse, to extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and instructive, but it does happen.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is intended to provide the children with all the necessities that were missing in the household from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to further possibilities in the use and satisfaction theory.
For example, there is an assumption that learning and socialization are important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
In a study of audience responses to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified 'personal engagement' and 'persistent relationships' as motivating aspects.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions and facial mimicry that last only a few milliseconds.
More specifically, it is claimed that correct interpretation of micro-statements can tell whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his work The President's Speech, showed that people who can't understand speech because of brain damage can accurately judge the sincerity of speech.
It even suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, may share such abilities in interpreting human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and visible.
Mutation adds new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the group of variations that are expressed.
Segregation and recombination blend variations between the two groups with each generation.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans has difficulty meeting its need to obtain amino acids from available plant sources.
Failure to do so will have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant sources were probably the proteins contained in the leaves and the legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ant, termite, egg) is not only easily digestible but also provides a large amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees do today on the savannah.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep time and then falling asleep shortly afterwards (10~60 minutes).
You can do this simply by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will wake you up without waking you up completely.
However, if you put off the alarm clock while you sleep, you may be able to place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids before bedtime (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic), which will force you to get up and go for a wet.
The degree of inner peace that one has is directly related to the tension in one's body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive life force.
The only obstacle is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded by the Mahayana way of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in its essence, and it involves Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yogic postures, aerobic exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The basis of Tibetan meditation is Divine Yoga, where the visualization of the various deities cleanses the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates the consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S.A. After the war, these allies were divided by the very clash of systems, processes and culture.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last another 40 years, and it was really fought through proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defensive wall had been broken and its only hope was to retreat and re-arrange along the Romanian perimeter.
But these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops, in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Polish-Soviet Nonaggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral, entered the eastern regions of Poland and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional role of the Navy was to ensure that your country maintained the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time preventing your enemy from moving people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans tried to move troops and equipment across the Atlantic to help the British.
And at the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop these movements, mainly by submarines.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably be able to conquer Britain, as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were usually reared in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, and were often herded by goat herders, often children or adolescents, similar to the common shepherd.
In England, railways were built as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriages consisted of only horizontal wooden planks, they allowed the heavy horses to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
The paddles were introduced early to hold the rails in place, but later it was found that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal belt on top.
This became common practice, but iron caused the wooden wheels of the chariots to wear out more.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels, and the first all-iron railway was built in 1767.
The first known transport is walking. People started walking upright two million years ago, when Homo Erectus evolved.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright.
Two-legged specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to be more environmentally conscious, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce suffering in the future to some extent.
As in many cases, it is something like symptomatic treatment, but if we want to be more than just a temporary solution, we should get to the root of the problem and we should eliminate it.
Clearly, mankind's scientific and technological advances have changed the world greatly, and overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles have only made matters worse.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten bill signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printer.
Over the course of a single night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap's side pages".
The first public reading of the document was delivered by John Nixon and took place on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, read to his troops in New York on July 9th, and a copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap side-papers still exist and are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today hold the view that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many things in birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1. These numbers are referred to in computer jargon as binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, as symptoms such as vomiting are too general to be diagnosed immediately.
The quickest sign to determine internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household cleaning chemicals.
Look for the first aid instructions on the label for this particular nuisance.
The term "beetle" is used by entomologists for this group of insects in the formal sense of the word.
The name comes from the old knowledge of the bed bug, which is an insect highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the larvae and the beetles are nimble, adapted to nesting or placed on their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 reported cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it one of the leading neurological diseases in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples may decide to make a so-called adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that the other couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to use scientific methods to find out how the world works, and these methods actually drive most scientific research.
But it's not just about experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
All of Aristotle's scientific knowledge, including that of psychology, was accepted.
The West gradually found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots as knowledge of Greek declined.
Many observed physiological rhythms and rhythms in behavior are often critically dependent on the presence of internal cycles and their formation through biological clocks.
Most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, have been documented to have regular rhythms that are not just a response to external repetitive signals.
The biological clock is an independent oscillator that will continue to run in a free-loop cycle even in the absence of stimuli from the external environment.
The experiment done by Hershey and Chase was one of the main indications that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments labeling either DNA in a phage with radioactive phosphorus or protein in a phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on their type, the importance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the cells are affected by the germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
Examples include tours, photography and exploring the organiganguang of Borneo.
Each morning, people leave small rural towns for work, and others pass by to work where the first ones left.
In this shuttle transport, everyone is somehow tied to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has supplanted the stable state of the biosphere that has supported human development for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail every day? Are they just incompetent transportation engineers? Or is there something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the result of observing the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and tracking their interactions.
Unfortunately, traffic flow studies are challenging because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently, and therefore, traffic flows, which can be roughly represented mathematically, often behave consistently.
For a more graphic representation of the traffic flow, the relationships between these three main characteristics have been defined: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of terrestrial communications.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them escape their enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards along their body.
This offers them a greater choice of small places to hide from predators.
Now, there's only one insect that can't fold its wings, and that's the dragonfly and the ladybug.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, and it carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, up to six miles wide in places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
The building of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in size or technical perfection.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were captivated by the memories of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest sovereign state in the world with the lowest population.
In the Vatican, Italian is used for official communication and legislation.
Italian is also used in everyday life by the majority of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to man since ancient times because they are all found in nature in their natural form and can be mined quite easily with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It looked like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
They're alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
When the pencil was introduced, it became a good friend of many people.
However, as newer writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to the sidelines and used less and less.
People are now leaving links on computer screens and never having to go near the stream.
You can just think about what happens to the keyboard when something new comes out.
The fission bomb uses the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with a number of protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a truck up a hill, and then when you split the core, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they are prone to break up with little or no impact.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the upper side and 100 kilometers thick on the lower side.
It's thinner under the sail and thicker under the top.
There may be more moonfish on the near side, because the crust is thinner, and the lava is easier to get to the surface.
Content theories are about finding out what drives people to behave or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become their own as adults.
These theories focus on what motivates people to want to do certain things and what their environment forces them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behaviour that can occur when managers start leading their previous peers: at one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain in the position of 'one of the party' (or 'friends').
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, determining responsibility, and even having responsibility to people.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual with a sense that you have to change everything that the team has done and do it your way.
The executive is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the entire team.
This behaviour often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual and traditional teams follow the same quality standards, but with small differences.
Virtual team members mostly serve as a point of contact for their live physical team.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet in changing time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
A unique feature of a virtual team is also the presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member is subordinate. e invisible team also sets conditions for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used efficiently across the executive departments of the organization, the doors to creativity and inventiveness open.
The process of collaborating in an organisation to overcome an obstacle can then lead to a new innovative process that will help to meet customer needs.
An organisation can be innovative, but first, management must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
The film Anjel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organisations aim to achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide tangible evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, narrowing the field of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is supporting scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes like never before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
AI has a strong connotation of science fiction and constitutes a major branch of computer science that deals with the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of robots.
AI research involves the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Cases include control, planning and layout, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to life's problems.
Artificial intelligence is now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, having been incorporated into several applications in home computers, or applications in video game software.
An important part of the life of every class is the excursion, and the teacher would often like to take her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual excursions, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in a classroom with their classmates.
A great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with other classes is to share the trip in a virtual way.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year, the website is redesigned, but older versions are kept online to serve as a journal.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In blogging, students are 'forced to orient themselves more towards the world around them'.The need to satisfy the audience's interest thus inspires students to become smarter and to pursue their own interests (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs allows students to deepen their analytical and critical thinking; through active response to online materials, students can define their own positions in the context of others' writings as well as outline their own views on specific problems (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming 'bilingual' capital, offering visitors a wealth of art galleries and museums that represent its past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north are the pristine natural beauties of the Muskoka region.
All these things and more are what elevates Ontario as what foreigners consider to be essentially Canadian.
Large areas farther north are relatively sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: There are more African-Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or have links with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries and in the Comoros and the islands of Mayotte, they embraced it in style.
The period of European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route from Europe to India around the Cape of Good Hope.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All traveling women are advised to state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (but only one that does not look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they would normally consider harassment, such as being followed, being grabbed on the shoulder, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to take a stand (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. and served as a strategic port for the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan renamed the city Dar al-Bajda, and the Spanish merchants who established trading posts in the city gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
The old Medina is easy to find selling traditional Moroccan products such as taginis, pottery, leather goods, water pipes, and a variety of geegaws, but these are all for the tourist.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially its downtown.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, before you travel outside of Goma, you should do your research to understand the ongoing fighting situation in the province of North Kivu.
The town is also the starting point for the Nyiragongo volcano ascent and one of the cheapest places to watch mountain gorillas in Africa.
To travel around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
"Timbuktu" has come to be used metaphorically to refer to relatively inaccessible, exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a run-down city, though it has a reputation for being a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, the city was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of desert sand.
It was one of Henry Louis Gates's main stops during the special program The Wonders of the African World on PBS.
The city stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the country, as its appearance is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) in northeastern South Africa straddles the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the KrokodÃ­lia River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which supports different wildlife.
It is one of the major attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Here, too, daily maintenance and entrance fees are the same as in all South African national parks.
The most advantageous way may be to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to either a select number of parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's national parks.
The whole area is called Hong Kong after the island and is a focal point for many tourists.
The set of buildings that outline Hong Kong could be compared to the glowing column graph seen from Victoria Harbor.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, you must leave the island and head across the street to the coast of Kowloon.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers took over, and if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarban is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarban has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest in Indian territory is designated as the Sundarban National Park.
The forests include not only the mangrove swamps but also some of the last remnants of the vast jungle that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km2, about one-third of which is water/wetland.
Since 1966, Sundarbans have been the kingdom of wildlife, and it is estimated that there are now 400 tigers and some 30,000 axis deer in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance, as intercity buses are often full.
Most districts are served by small, comfortable, and robust Japanese Coaster buses.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby towns such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the entire Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
These two towers rise to a height of 273 feet [83 m], are 1,228 feet [378 m] long, and have two lanes that are 11 feet [3.5 m] wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was put into operation only in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, by which time the Brazilian customs inspection reports should be completed.
The GuaranÃ­ were the most important indigenous group in the area of present-day eastern Paraguay, semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the GuaycurÃº and PayaguÃ¡, who made their living by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Great Province of India", was born as a result of clashes between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, AsunciÃ³n has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Polo Grounds in the Las CaÃ±itas district.
Minor tournaments and matches are held here at other times of the year.
Information about tournaments and how to buy tickets for polo matches can be found on the website of the AsociaciÃ³n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency in the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP), which is set at the equivalent of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards in remote islands are unlikely to be accepted, although both British and American currency may be accepted; check this with the owners in advance to find out what the accepted payment method is.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside the islands, so you should take your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer, and vice versa.
Montevideo is subtropical; in the summer months, temperatures are above +30Â°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no special 'rain and dry' periods: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to human presence, wildlife remains wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials say you should stay at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
No matter how calm they appear, bison, moose, deer, bears, and almost any large animal can strike.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep enough distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so they need to be given space.
Also, be aware that the smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid passing on or cooking aromatic foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1950s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval misunderstanding in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the US and the UK refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser were sunk, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly of people in the city led to the assassination of Tupua supreme chief Tamasese Lealofi III.
The boundary of the two ports in Auckland allows for the existence of many beaches, the most popular of which are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in North Harbor County) are located on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most of them are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour on the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded beaches for families with plenty of shops lining the shore.
The main local beer is Number One, not a complex beer, but a nice and refreshing one.
Many French wines are available, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more available.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're concerned, getting bottled water is no problem.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is foreign. Small black coffee is "espresso", cappuccino is served with a high layer of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many trips to the cliffs are made all year round, and injuries due to any of these causes are rare on the cliffs.
Nevertheless, follow the instructions of the competent authorities, follow the directions of the signs and pay particular attention to the safety warnings.
The jellyfish are found near the beaches and estuaries from October to April north of the town of 1770. Occasionally they are found here outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and are used to swim away.
Sea crocodiles do not live primarily in the ocean, their usual habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking ahead of time gives the traveler the assurance that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies usually have agreements with specific hotels, but they also offer the possibility of booking other forms of accommodation, such as camping.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation, or even a combined flight and hotel package.
They can also hold your reservation if you need more time to think about the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any suggestions for change or requests should be directed first to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors choose to camp on site, and most participants consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get there early to get camping close to the music.
Remember, even if the main stage ends, some parts of the festival may have music playing late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the North Atlantic in the winter, check the location of your cabin, because crossing the ice is making a pretty awful noise to those who are most affected.
Cruises in St Petersburg include a stay in the city.
Casinos usually go to great lengths to make sure that guests spend as much time and money as possible, and they often lack windows or clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have unique offerings of food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests entertained and to keep them going as long as possible.
Since drunkenness impairs judgment, all good players are aware of the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will be driving at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or frost.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you cannot drive as if you were on a clear asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short period of time that you could get stuck in it.
Reduced visibility may be caused by snow falling or blowing, condensation of water on windows or also ice forming on the vehicle windows.
In contrast, in many lands ice and snow are common, and traffic continues almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
The safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a great experience for many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to a ground journey to explore the vast wilderness of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are used to getting close to cars, and standard equipment will allow good observation.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and can be better seen from a distance with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called bushwalking or tourist safari or just walking) is a tour of several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will take place at various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay notice, you may have gotten yourself into an awkward situation.
The cancellation conditions vary, but at the end of March, most cancellations whose origin is in the coronavirus, do not exceed until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with the price of a standard ticket around 7,000 yen.
Even when they are not in the room, many hotels have an iron and an ironing board for borrowing.
If an iron is not available or if you do not like to iron your socks, you can try using a hairdryer if available.
Be careful not to make the cloth too hot (this can cause it to become crumpled, and in extreme cases, to burn).
There are various methods of purifying water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for just one minute is enough; in others, it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travellers may come into contact with animal pests not present in their home regions.
Pests can degrade food, cause irritation, or in the worst-case scenario, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or violently kill humans are not usually classified as pests.
Purchases in duty-free zones allow goods to be procured free of ordinary and excise taxes.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging driving section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, as it often passes through isolated forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: they are full of steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The published speed limits are significantly lower than on the preceding and following sections - normally 56-64 km/h - and their strict adherence is more important than ever.
Apparently, the cell phone service here is much stronger than on many other sections of the trail, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German confectionery is quite good, and in Bavaria it is quite colorful and varied, similar to that of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cake is common, with apples usually baking in the cake year-round, while cherries and plums are usually appearing over the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts, and the popular pies are often paired with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but hearty bun, try the stuffed bun, which is called either Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a herb- and spice-based dish, along with meat or vegetables.
It is known as a "dry" or "wet" curry depending on the amount of liquid used.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines that you can find across the country.
When used without further qualification, this term tends to denote food originating from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, includes a variety of simple-tasting dishes. Among the predominant flavorings favored by Javanese are peanuts, chilies, sugar (primarily Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The bushes are the supports for the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, but can also pose a safety risk as they can potentially trap the rider's legs.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has his foot caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the horse escapes.
Most riders wear riding boots with heels and a fairly narrow smooth sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English ones, are equipped with safety bars that allow the saddle to fall off if the falling rider pulls it back.
The CochamÃ³ Valley is a popular mountaineering destination in Chile, and for its diverse huge granite walls and rock formations, it is called the Yosemite of South America.
The views from the tops of the shields are breathtaking, and climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes between the walls' infinite potential.
Popular winter downhill sports such as skiing and snowboarding involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity, which has many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski fanatics", who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
Cross-country skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backpacking, ski mountaineering or ski tourism.
It is related to (but usually does not include) alpine skiing and mountaineering, which is practiced on steep terrain and requires much harder skis and footwear.
Consider the ski trail as a similar tourist trail.
Under the right conditions, you will be able to cover a little more distance than if you were walking  but you will rarely reach the speed you would if you were running without a heavy backpack on the track.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is home to many independent states.Under normal circumstances, travelling across several countries would mean having to repeatedly apply for a visa and pass passport controls.
In this respect, the Schengen area functions to a certain extent as one country.
If you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Also, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen area member countries separately, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique.Some tax authorities define antiques as goods more than 100 years old.
Detention conditions vary around the world, and this age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products may be classified as antiques despite being younger than a similar mass-produced product.
Reindeer herding is an important way of life for the Sami, and trade culture is important for many other professions.
Traditionally, however, not all Sami were involved in reindeer husbandry in large numbers, but they also made a living by fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Today, many SÃ¡mi are involved in modern crafts.
Although the word Gypsy is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is often considered offensive for its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma.
If the country you are about to visit is the subject of a travel advisory, this may affect your travel medical insurance or cancellation insurance.
You may want to consult the advice of other governments besides your own government, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.

Adverse weather is a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, cause serious social disruption or lead to loss of life.
Adverse weather and its varieties, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions, can occur anywhere in the world.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and fires are the forms and effects of adverse weather, such as storms, tornadoes, hailstorms and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal adverse weather events include thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
We strongly advise travellers to consider all risks that could arise as a result of adverse weather in their area, which could affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country considered a war zone should take part in a vocational training course.
Just search the Internet for "the cost of a hostile environment" and you will likely find the address of a local company.
The course covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, along with practical experience.
The duration of the course is usually 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, first aid instruction and sometimes perhaps weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are common, but publications dealing with war zones are scarce.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should make sure that they have valid documents with them for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with no gender (X) or documents updated to match the desired gender and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies as well.
In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, security checkpoints also became much more intrusive.
Transgender people should not expect to pass the scans without invasion of privacy and dignity.
Back currents are the returning backs of waves that break on a beach, often at a cliff or similar.
Thanks to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in several deeper sections, where fast currents up to deep water can form.
For most deaths, the exhaustion of the attempt can be swum back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you get off the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to head somewhere where you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether someone's registered you, you might try to wait for rescue.
The return shock occurs more rapidly than the culture shock (the initial idyllic phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
For travellers who have easily adapted to a new culture, it is sometimes particularly difficult to readjust to their original culture.
After returning home from abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and have lost some of your customs from your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
People may not anticipate that passengers returning home need patience and understanding.
The pyramidal sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children to do in this area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show begins.
Usually, you hear the tourists and the vendors, and the story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The sphinx is exposed as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The pyramids are depicted with different scenes and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen still active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest being King Juraj Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano forms a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is an area located in the southern part of the peninsula and is bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains join the upper plateau here and then rise again to form the 360-kilometre-long Ellsworth Range, which is carved by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Mountains is home to Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak, Mount Vinson, reaching an elevation of 4,892 m (18,520 ft).

A satellite phone is not a replacement for a mobile phone, and to make calls with it, you must be outside in a place with a clear view of the satellite.
This service is often used in boat traffic, including cruise ships, as well as on voyages requiring long-distance data and voice communications.
Your local telephone provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
For those planning a gap-year, travel and learning is an increasingly popular choice.
It's especially popular with recent graduates, as it offers them the option of a gap year before university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, attending a foreign exchange course can actually increase your chances of getting into higher education in your own country.
Registration for these education programmes usually requires payment of a tuition fee.
Finland is a great place for boating. 'The land of a thousand lakes' also has a thousand islands, in lakes and on coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht to see the islands and lakes.
While the coastal islands and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national sport, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
It is the same for Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (for example in the Netherlands, the number is 1 in forty).
Most Baltic Sea cruises also offer an extended stay in St Petersburg, Russia.
It means you have a couple of full days to visit the historic city, while you return to the ship for the night.
If you only go to the coast for a sightseeing excursion by boat, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures include the German city of Berlin. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not by the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience, regardless of the age or condition of the passengers, especially if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal anxieties and aversions to other things that so many people have.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help overcome the fear of the unknown or of not having control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast delivery, and time is often of the essence when it comes to commercial documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and smaller companies, there is a problem.
If the goods were sent by air freight, unloading and unloading could take days on some routes.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage, but airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, so here you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to put a lot of money into this privilege (or ideally to get your company to do it for you).
It will not be cheap, however: you can expect to pay an estimated four times as much for business class and eleven times as much for first class!
In general, it is not worthwhile to look for discounts on business tickets or first class on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain base group of passengers who are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau, and the local language is Romanian, although Russian is very common.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member state.
Economic relations between the two parts of Moldova have been restored despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Ä°zmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.

The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir, and is characterised by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide range of plant communities due to its range of microclimates, diverse soils, and varying elevations.

The Malorese cuisine, like that of other Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (primarily pork), and olive oil is essential.
A simple favorite dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes or other accompaniment, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns and personal pronouns Sie (Vy) always begin with a capital letter, even if they are in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way of distinguishing between verbs and objects.
It also helps to make it easier to read, but it's a little more complicated to write because you have to distinguish between a verb and an adjective in the negative form.
The pronunciation in Italian is quite simple, since most words are pronounced the same way as they are written

Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christendom, and it is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many holiday traditions have been adopted by nonbelievers and non-Christians around the world in Christian lands.
Traditionally, you will stay up at night under the stars to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Mass on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with the assemblies often celebrating the stroke of midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally came to the islands either swam in, flew in, or swam over.
Because of the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make this journey, and the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans on Galapagos, many mammals have been brought to the territory, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in the winter, you will be able to experience a polar night, meaning that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It'll be a good opportunity to observe the aurora because the sky will be dark more or less continuously.
And you can enjoy the stars, too, because light smog is not a problem in sparsely populated areas.
The Japanese work culture is much more hierarchical and formal than what people in the West are used to.
Suits are common work clothes, and co-workers address each other by nicknames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is key, emphasising the efforts of the group rather than the achievements of individuals.
Often, employees must obtain the approval of their superiors before making any decision, and they are expected to follow their instructions unreservedly.
