Welsh MPs do not want to be seen as 'muppeters'
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, known today as the Assembly Members, are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title be changed to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes as a result of the plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from across the political spectrum fear that this could lead to ridicule.
A representative from Labour explained that his group was concerned because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means dustete, and pwp means b√¶sj.
A representative of the Wales-party Plaid Cymru said the group as a whole was "displeased" and that they had proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh section of the conservative party said that his group was open for the name change, but noted that the statement of MWP is very close to the word Muppet, which in addition to being the name of some well-known dolls, is also a British slang word for dust.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced in a similar manner to the letter U in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like a uh sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the name change, said: "It is of course the members themselves who have final discretion as to what name they should be referred to with.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its own name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public hearing that showed public support for the re-dedication of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the representatives' title, the WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members) supported the commission, but the MWP received the most support during the public hearing.
Representatives are suggesting other options, but getting all parties to agree could lead to a head-burst for parliamentary president Elin Jones, who will deliver a legislative draft for the name change in the next few weeks.
The legislation will include other changes to the way the National Assembly functions, including rules for disqualifying representatives and the design of the committee system.
Representatives have the final right to vote on what they are to be called when debating the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to decide whether the country's name should be changed
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia can vote on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was held in an attempt to resolve a several decades-long dispute with the neighbouring Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a requirement of its territory, and has repeatedly opposed its membership in the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president Gjorge Ivanov, a vocal opponent of the referendum, has said he will ignore the vote.
The supporting actors of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price they must pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's are ringing  the crickets in Harlem are hurting
"The old people I spoke to told me that before that there was a bar and a church on every corner", Adams says.
Now there's none of the parts.
He said the children's decline was understandable.
People socialise in other ways now to this day, he says.
Bars are no longer meeting places of the local community, which everyone visits regularly.
As for the churches, he fears that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders think.
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who will not help the neighborhood's remaining temples.
"The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he says, "and therefore will only accelerate the day when these churches must close their doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches".
Both crickets were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropol of the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had held to nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's had a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of dealers on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main dealers, because they failed to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 caused extensive damage to the building, and when Father Johnson's grandchildren made plans for the rebuilding, they bought a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly declared that the carillon was the church clock of the poor people.
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: a cultural tax and an unreplaceable historical instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's has never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's over the past few months is a complicated interaction between architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom are initiated by the church's Leg Folks Leadership and others by the bishopric.
The church council, consisting of lay people, wrote to the bishopric in July concerning its concern that the bishopric came to try to force the costs on the church council, despite the fact that the church council had not been involved in the inlaying of the architects or contractors sent by the bishopric.
Some of the children of the parishes complained of lack of openness from the bishop's side.
Shark injuries thirteen-year-old on lobster duck in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he came in search of hummingbirds in California on Saturday, the first day of hummingbirds' season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help, and that he and a group of others were swimming over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy was shouting out of excitement over having caught a lobster, but he soon realized that the boy was shouting 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!'
His entire collarbone was torn up, says Hammel, who discovered the injury when he reached the boy.
"I called for everyone to come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water,'" Hammel added.
The boy was transported with air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is being treated in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is not known.
Badevakt captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said the victim suffered serious injuries to his upper torso.
The authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to make its income on the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with warehouse-like makeup and beauty care shelters, staffed by specially trained employees.
The expanded shelves are being tested in 11 stores around the country as part of a massive surge in the UK's 2.8 million-plus beauty retail market, which is experiencing steady growth as sales of clothing and home goods fall.
The investment in beauty care is a result of the supermarket's efforts to find a new use area for the space that was previously used for TVs, microwave ovens and home articles.
Sainsbury's has said it will double the number of beauty care products it offers to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the chain has never sold before.
Existing product selections from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also gain better place in noted brand areas, in the same way as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket chain also relaunched its Boutique-smink brand with mainly vegan products, as it became increasingly in demand among younger customers.
In addition, the fragrance retailer The Fragrance Shop will test out sales tables in two Sainsbury's stores, one opened in Croydon in south-London last week, while the other will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Net-trading and a new trend to buy small amounts of food daily from local grocery stores means that supermarkets must do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, managing director of Sainsbury's, has said that sales will gradually resemble a more and more branded magazine, as the supermarket takes up the fight against the cheap Aldi and Lidl stores with more services and goods other than food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos-outlets in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced a number of Habitat-outlets after purchasing both chains two years ago.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to upgrade the beauty care and pharmaceutical departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots early in the 2000s, but the collaboration was dissolved after a dispute over the distribution of the income from the pharmacies in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding a selection of luxury luxury brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We've transformed the look and design of beauty care shelves to create more welcoming environments for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who are then ready to give advice and help.
Our brand selection is designed to meet all needs, and the inviting surroundings and practical locations make us a beauty pageant competitor representing a new shopping experience.
Peter Jones is astonished after Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal worth GBP 11 million
Dragons' star Peter Jones is reportedly furious after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an 11-million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and their accessory brand, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop.
Willoughby (37) who is the program manager for This Morning, announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has made the Dragons' Den-star Peter Jones furious by pulling out of their profitable lifestyle brand in the last second to focus on her own new gold-edged contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "surprising" at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, where the television's gold maiden admitted that her new contracts worth up to GBP 1.5 million meant she no longer had time to spare for their clothing and accessories brand, Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop, and it was expected that it would double Willoughby's estimated fortune of GBP 11 million.
While Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she would be leaving Truly, Jones left Britain on her way to one of her holiday homes.
One source said: "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's first priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security in the next decades.
Everyone is completely shocked that she has chosen to retire.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday, it was just before the launch.
Now a warehouse full of goods is standing at the headquarters in Marlow, now ready for sale.
Experts believe that the This Morning programme manager, who is among Britain's most popular stars, could cost the company several million pounds due to major investments in products such as pillows and lights, fashion and cooking, as well as a potential delay in launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Trebarnsmother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV program I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said yesterday that we would not comment on his business affairs.
Checking facts and then we fell in love
He was critical of the news media for having come up with a comment some would consider as "little president-elect" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given away so much?
Trump said in his imitation of a news anchor.
I haven't given away anything.
He noted that Kim is interested in a new meeting, after even declaring that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a big mess on the road to nuclear disarmament by North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN general assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not seen a "responsive" response from the United States to its early disarmament efforts.
He noted that the United States instead still has sanctions that aim to keep the pressure on.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for an assembly of his constituents.
"We're doing very well with North Korea", he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Many millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a huge relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results, such as putting a stop to rocket tests, helping to free hostages and getting the remains of American service personnel sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing to the area right in front of him.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia ravages an island and kills hundreds of people
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, foreign ideological organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lombok residents had lost their homes, it was not declared a national disaster, a requirement for international aid to be sent in.
"In many cases, they have unfortunately made it quite clear that they do not ask for international help.
Save the children now sets up a team to travel to Palu, but is not yet sure whether foreign workers will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the national crisis management agency, said Indonesian authorities are considering the situation in Palu to see whether international organizations should be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Considering the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly experiencing, the country is terribly ill-prepared to deal with the wrath of nature.
Lies to protect against tsunamis are built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning siren on Palu, although a warning had been sent out, has likely contributed to the death toll.
Even under the best of circumstances, traveling between Indonesia's many islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A sick ship that was stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made an upgrade of Indonesia's falleferdige infrastructure to a key point in his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on road and rail.
But money shortages have been a major problem for Joko's administration, which is due to stand for re-election next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from sustained sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have moved to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge with late equaliser in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Premier League loss to Chelsea on Saturday by scoring in the 89th minute of the match at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from the Chelsea goal while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to his left foot before sending it toward the longest corner.
The experiment went high above the box as the ball fell toward the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually went over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq always send the ball forward as best they can, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante come and touch the ball once and didn't think too much about it and just kicked it off.
Chelsea led 1-0 at the break, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues-attack player sent a passing with the heel back to Mateo Kovacic, before he changed direction near the midfield and sprinted into Liverpool's halfway field.
Kovacic came up with a quick delivery on the midfield.
He fired a huge breakout that brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner of the field, with a left-handed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play against Napoli in the group game of the Champions League at 15.00 on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Napoli, Italy.
Chelsea play against Videoton in the Europa League in men's football in London at 15.00 on Thursday.
Deaths from tsunamis in Indonesia reach 832
The death toll after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's crisis management agency announced early on Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a 7.5-strike that hit the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six metres, state spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho explained at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380 000 inhabitants, was full of materials from razed buildings.
Police arrest man (32) for murder after a woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation is being conducted after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, in the morning.
The 44-year-old was found with a stab wound at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street.
Police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything to contact them.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: "We're just at the beginning of the investigation, but I would ask anyone in the area around John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
We also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on their car camera, to contact us. They may have information that is crucial to our investigation.
A police spokesperson confirmed that the deceased woman was a resident of Birkenhead, and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about the location where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police have said they are working to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take several hours before they can enter again.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as an oasis.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She repeats it's so horrible again and again.
At 14 a.m., two police cars were behind the barrier, while a third car was just outside.
A number of police officers stood outside the barrier and had oversight of the apartment complex.
Persons with information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, by referring to log 247 from 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell is the last memorial to be drawn into the controversy over the rewrite of history.
Removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures carried out by his fanatical puritan followers.
However, the Comwell Society has described Jeremy Crick's publishing company as "tapeable" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, leader of the Cromwell Society, says: "It was inevitable in the current debate regarding the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace also came to be a goal.
The English Civil War's iconoclasm was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the preceding century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's fantastic production of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th-century views and is part of the historiography of a man many believe still deserves to be hailed.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, as the parliament's defender against pressure from outside.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering.
Killing pigs take the life of Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on an island market in southwest China, local news reports said.
The man, who is only mentioned by the surname Yuan, was found dead and covered in blood from a torn pulse near a binge on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pigbond is preparing to put vaccines on pigs on a farm on May 30, 2005 in the city of Xining, Qinghai province in China.
He had reportedly traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the fatter found him dead, and discovered that the gate to a nearby pigsty was open.
He said that inside the pigsty was a big madman with blood on his mouth.
A court-medical investigation confirmed that the pig at 250 kg had killed the man.
Beina of my cousin was bloody and mistreated explained the cousin, referred to by the surname Wu, in a quotation to Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance camera's data showed Yuan entered the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
While the police gathered evidence from the scene, one of the market's leaders explained that the pig was locked in to prevent it from attacking anyone else.
Yuans family and the market's management are negotiating compensation for the death.
Although this is happening, it is not the first time a pig has attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on a farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injury to the man.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pressed against a tractor and attacked by a pig at 300 kg until the farmer's wife managed to chase the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba explained to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to normal, but that the taste of blood can have an outgrowing effect.
They're just playing.
They like to bite, and are very curious... they try not to hurt anyone.
You just have to show sufficient respect.
The remnants of the storm Rosa will lead to heavy rain in the southwest of the United States
As reported, the storm Rosa is weakened as it moves over the cooler sea on the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa will nevertheless carry with her floodwaters on her journey through northern Mexico and southwest United States during the next few days.
Rosa had a wind strength of 135 km/h and was a category 1 hurricane at 05.00 ET on Sunday, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a train begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward toward the west coast of the United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the interaction between tropical moisture and the approaching drought will lead to widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous flooding, floating rushes and rapid and possible landslides in the desert.
Dyptropical humidity will lead to downbursts of up to 57 cm per hour in some areas, particularly areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 510 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are opportunities for flooding with rapidly worsening conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move around the desert on foot as long as there is danger of tropical rainfall.
Strong rainfall can cause river beds to become braghtooth, and thunderstorms can cause local windfalls that can contain dust and sand.
The approaching storm will cause local heavy rainfall for parts of the coast along Southern California.
Total rainfall over 1.3 cm is possible, and this can lead to flowing rushes and rapid, as well as smooth weibanes.
This will be the area's first rainfall of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain towns will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and persist through Wednesday.
October can cause some intense temperature swings across the United States as the Arctic becomes colder but the tropics keep themselves very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We'll see a clear example of the strong temperature differences across the central United States on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the continuing summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States will likely get a warm start on October, with degrees high on the tjuetallet from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York City could reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday. This would be about 5.5 degrees higher than average.
Our long-term climate report indicates that eastern U.S. most likely will have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing.
More than 20 million viewers, distributed across six TV networks, watched Thursday's gripping testimony from Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault that is believed to have taken place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political feud continued, and broadcasters interrupted their regular broadcasts to announce Friday's big surprise in the last second, when it emerged that Arizona's senator, Jeff Flake, had arranged for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh was drinking her and was trying to take off her clothes at a youth school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he was 100 percent sure this did not happen.
The Friday broadcast was likely seen by more than the 20,4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average viewership figures for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Seertall was not immediately available to other networks that showed the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has problems measuring office visitors.
To give you a little perspective, this is the final number in the American football championship or the Oscar.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have supported Kavanaugh's appointment with great enthusiasm, led the way among the networks, averaging 5.69 million viewers for the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest was still high after the hearing.
Flake was the main character of Friday's drama.
The moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he was voting in Kavanaugh's favor, and on Friday morning he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras as he tried to take the elevator to a meeting in the courthouse committee while protesters shouted and shouted at him.
He stared down for several minutes while being shelled out, while the incident was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he's telling our country the truth?
He heard that you have power when so many women are powerless.
Flake pointed out that his office had come up with an opinion, and said that when the elevator doors closed, he came to have more to say about the matter on the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks covered all the hearings directly several hours later, when the judges' committee voted on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be continued to the entire senate for voting.
But Flake said he was only willing to do this if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate within the next week, as the Democratic minority has called for.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
Flake took his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's election had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of playing politics around Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of her plan to leave the EU to play a "political game" with Britain's future and undermine the nation's interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, printed side by side with her own on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson has continued his attack on her so-called "Chequers" plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal that the UK and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "absolutely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of causing LSU player death
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) was arrested and charged with premeditated murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities have released a video recording of the Sims-Simpson confrontation, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the basketball attack.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS partner WAFB.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he confesses to shooting and killing Wayde.
His causation is set at $350 000, according to The Advocate.
The Justice Department of East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a head and neck gunshot wound.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police for its work group for the recruitment of refugees, the state's police laboratory, the Southern University police and the local population for their contributions to the investigation that led to an arrest.
Sports director Joe Alleva thanked the police force for their hard work and quest for justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shaking up" and "shocked" after Wayde's death.
"This is what we fear all the time", Wade said.
Volcano spraying ash over Mexico City
The ash that springs out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The Centro Nacional de Prevenci√≥n de Desastres, Mexico's public agency for crisis prevention, warned the population on Saturday that they must stay away from the volcano after activity climbed the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within one day.
The agency monitored several cases of bulging and shaking.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash that covered front lanes on the cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake shook central-Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protesters for independence clashed with police, while thousands participated in competing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the rebel police, and bombed them with eggs and powder painting, causing dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
Hand-held fighting broke out later that day, as police used batons to limit the fighting.
For several hours independence demonstrators stood and shouted Never forget, never forgive, face to face with unionist demonstrators who shouted Long live Spain.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they received during the protests, according to the local press.
The tensions are still high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the October 1 referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed a overwhelming overtall for the rioting, but it was a bad upcoming because the vote was boycotted by most of those opposed to the release.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after police tried to stop the vote, which was held at election stations across the region.
Frigj√∏rings groups set up camps in the streets on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held back, however, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hopes for Catalonia's ability to become independent.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy at being voted, but now we're stuck, he said.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalan independence have had problems keeping the pressure up this year, as many of their most prominent leaders have traveled in self-imposed exile or are in custody while awaiting trial for their role in arranging the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used her phone to film the protest to support police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
The situation is becoming more and more tense, he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been imprisoned pending a trial since late last year, announced that he will stand for election to the European Parliament next year.
'To stand for election as a candidate in the European elections is the best I can do to condemn the repression and regression of democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government,' he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car was driven several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
An armbrust may also have been fired at the vehicle at some point.
Mengas attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
Livinston surprised Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
A good hit from Dolly Menga proved to be decisive, and Gary Holt's side is now tied with Hibernian on second place.
Gerrard's side have yet to win on the away field in the Premier League this season and will play against the Hearts, who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Prior to this, Rangers will play home-court against Rapid Wien in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, has held on to unbeaten status through six games in the division.
Livingston is missing opportunities against his sluggish guests
Holt's team should have led long before they scored, as their direct approach caused countless problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but the bomb hit the target, and Alan Lithgow could only send the kicker on after sliding in to meet Craig Halkett header past the target.
The hosts let Rangers play in front of them, well aware that they could make problems for their guests at death ball.
And that's how the ultimate goal came about.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston found an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga a clear run, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
Before this stage, the Rangers had the ball almost all the time, but the home team's defense had proved to be impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed a nestenscoring that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the Rangers keeper Allan McGregor's feet, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston-deathball in a wide card-pass.
Crossing the Livingston box was still being saved, while two penalty claims were overlooked once after Halket's protest against the in-laws Glenn Middleton, and once for hands.
Fenomenal from Livingston  analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were all amazing, and they continue to exceed all expectations on the way up.
The style of play and the crew have hardly changed since they came to their peak again, but Holt should have a lot of the credit for the way he has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated an enormously well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the entire match.
Rangers, however, had no inspiration to distinguish themselves from me.
Although they have at times been very good under Gerrard, they failed to live up to this standard.
The last part of the match was the laberas, they only came in on the home team's halfway point once and there was a bit of a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just smile and blue sky on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
There have been divisions over issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open an enormous new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police gave security as the reason for the fact that a crowd of 25,000 did not get permission to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters met up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also let themselves be heard, and criticized both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to let him into the country.
The contradictory demonstrations reflect the split that follows a man who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Deptford collision: Syklist killed in collision with car
A cyclist is killed in a collision like a personal car in London.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy veil in Deptford south-east of the city, around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car was stopped and the cyclist was treated by an ambulance personnel, but the man died on the spot.
The collision takes place only one month after a cyclist died in an on-crowd crash where the driver fled the Childrens Street site, about one kilometer from the Saturday collision.
Metropolitan Police said police are working to identify the man and alert the relatives.
Roadblocks and bus omissions are in place, and bus drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in riots
Six prison guards were injured in an incident at a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
The fire broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday, and continues to this day.
Specialized Tornado officers are brought in to handle the incident, which involves eight inmates and is limited to one fly.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the site.
A spokesperson for the prison service said: "Special training prison personnel have been sent in to handle an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees are being treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons  the responsible will be transferred to the police, and may have to spend even more time behind bars and beating.
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison leader received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, the rebel police were called in to deal with a serious incident where the employees were attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (may be favorable for drought areas)
It is rare that Arizona is hit by a tropical low pressure, but it will likely happen early next week, as the remaining force of the hurricane moves through the desert areas of the southwest and brings with it flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rainfall will begin late Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has noted on Twitter that only ti tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the border with Arizona.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 510 cm of rainfall, with up to 15 cm in some locations in Mongollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas within the desert in the southwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin mountain range, will likely get between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of rainfall is possible in some areas.
For those outside the flood zone, Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall will likely be favorable, since the southwest of the United States is currently in a drought-prone state.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, slightly over 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, according to weather.com.
First, the hurricane hits Rosa land near the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa still has a strong windscale on Sunday morning, with maximum windscale of 137 km, is 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves 19 km/h.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, and thereby loses its force.
Therefore, it is expected to hit Mexico with tropical storm strength on Monday evening or afternoon.
The rainfall over parts of Mexico can be severe and cause great flooding.
Total rainfall of 7.5 cm is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with possibilities for up to 25 cm, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move northward over Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the border with Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical lowpressure, as it moves further through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
The major rainfall expected by Rosa or the remnants of it is very strong in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States, according to the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to produce life-threatening flooding and floating rusk and rapid in the desert and landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested, suspected of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found knifstukketed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area by Midsomer Norton around 04.00 BST on Sunday.
He was taken to hospital and his condition is expected to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
Police have asked anyone who may have a mobile recording of the incident to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered under the petty and the intellectual nature of the Democratic Party.
"A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said before a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered under the petty and the intellectual nature of the Democratic Party throughout the entire nomination process".
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, and strongly and emotionally denied the accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that he committed a sexual assault against her several decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford is also testified about his accusation during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw how brilliant, skilled and courageous Kavanaugh was that day.
"A voice to support Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to support one of our time's most accomplished jurists, with no plague in public service", he told a gathering of his supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred discreetly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about how important it is for the Republicans to vote at the midterm elections.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lifetime.
I'm not really a participant, but I'm a participant, he said.
That's why I travel around and fight for the best candidates.
Trump asserted that the Democrats have as their goal to "resist" and "impede".
The Senate's first midterm vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on Friday, according to what the assistant to a leader within the Republican Party has told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian landslides and tsunamis, numbers expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were drawn out to sea by huge waves that thundered against the beaches when a large earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Slawesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six metres high waves thundered in land around sunset, destroying everything in its path and drawing many out into drowning death.
Tsunamien came in the heels of an earthquake with a strength of 7.5.
"When the tsunami occurred yesterday, people still ran activities on the beach, did not immediately escape and ended up as victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's crisis management agency (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
The tsunami was not alone. It brought cars, trestammer and houses, it hit everything on land, Nugroho said, and allowed the tsunami to move over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Some climbed up in trees to escape the tsunami and survive.
Around 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the Crisis Management Agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and crushed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
After the quake continued to shake the coast town on Saturday.
The shelf of earthquakes could be felt by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's BPPT said in a statement that the force of Friday's tremendous earthquake was around 200 times greater than the force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami larger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the damage as "comprehensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the deaths and injuries could be on the coast of a larger country 300 km north of Palu, in a region called Donggala, which lies nearer to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication was completely forked, completely without information from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
More than 300 000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a press release, adding that their personnel and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not having informed that a tsunami had struck Palu, but the authorities said the waves had struck before the warning was issued.
In an amateur opptak shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard rushing desperate warnings that tsunamis are approaching passersby on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water comes tumbling toward the beach, ripping apart buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately authenticate the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large power outage that has hindered communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The military has begun sending transport planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated have still desperate need for food and other necessities.
The city's airport is only open for aid work, and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Deaths from tsunamis in Indonesia are up over 800.
It's totally awful.
World Visions personnel from Donggala have come safely to Palu centre, where they have sought shelter under presencing on the yard space in front of their office, but they passed through major destruction on the road, according to Doseba Sinay.
"They told me they saw hundreds of destroyed houses", he said.
It's totally awful.
When aid organizations began the grim preparations to deliver crisis aid, some complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of expertise were denied travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released into a crisis zone before it is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the government says 'Grie, this is a national disaster' we can open the borders for international aid, but the situation has not yet gained any status.
As the sun sets over Palu for the second time after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing hope that their loved ones will be among the miracle stories that illuminate the dark news behind tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was fishing out of a sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was freed by rescue crews after spending two days trapped under ruins with the body of her mother by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were conducted earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those caught in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional need to carry", he said.
Gendon told that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the practitioners who participated in the beach festival on Palu.
But the messages only led to gray hawk marks, rather than a pair of blue hawk marks.
I think it means that the messages were not delivered, he said.
Thieves steal USD 26,750 during minibank filling in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole USD 26,750 from a Brink's worker who filled a minibank in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied a minibank in the entertainment complex and made himself ready to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran up behind Brink's employees and stole a money check that was to be delivered.
Witnesses said several suspects fled the scene, but police have not specified how many were involved.
Anyone with information about their identity must contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The creation formerly known as Kanye West".
West (41) has had the nickname Ye over a longer period of time, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was launched in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected that he will release his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the program, after she cancelled on emossionally basis, according to the series creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing the album title with radio personality Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more of a representation of who we are.
He is one of many well-known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, which previously collaborated with West, has also varied between the use of bindestrek and large letters.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's incumbent president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed never to use military power against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repressions against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he would never use the military to suppress the Mexican people.
Military troops shot at a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968 and killed as many as 300 people, in a period when left-wing student movements were rooting across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to students and opening several free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double its financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence practitioner who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have issued announcements regarding artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the United States generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, for its part, introduced a plan last year and aims to be number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we're looking for the next big breakthrough", Lee said.
Double economic support can double the chance that the next big achievement in artificial intelligence will come from the United States, Lee told CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading companies for artificial intelligence, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system of artificial intelligence that beat the best Othello players in the United States, and later was a leader at Microsoft Research or director of Google's Chinese division.
Lee recognized the U.S. government's earlier technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held, to help find next-generation smart heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive state grants, according to Lee.
"It's not China that steals the academic leaders, it's the companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired smartheads from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
"I think those with a doctorate in artificial intelligence should receive an offer of residence permit automatically", he said.
China's state council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the development of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation finances people at academic institutions, in a similar way to the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations that distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Defense Department created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, they are currently investing more than USD 100 million in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the American law firm that has set its goal of creating a national security commission for artificial intelligence has been shut down for several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia, believes that the name of its northern neighbour is a requirement on Greek territory and has vetoed its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June based on the proposed new navet, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has created doubts that the referendum will meet the minimum requirement of 50 percent, which is mandatory for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: Are you for NATO and EU membership when approving the agreement with Greece?
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be able to gain membership in organizations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protective umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, it will probably be decisive, because a high enough number of parliamentarians have said they will respect the result of the vote.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission has said it had not received any irregularity reports by 13.00.
However, the attendance was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent at the previous parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote because of my children, we belong in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski (62) who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
Before the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) cleared a small scene and pulled out chairs in front of tents set up by those who were to boycott the vote.
"We are positive for NATO and the EU, but we will enter with our heads up, not be left behind", says Kavadarkov.
We're a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would lead to a much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to become members of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He says that a "yes" response will be a "confirmation" of our future.
According to a questionnaire published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of eligible voters will participate in the referendum, which is lower than the required number of voters.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious political obstacle the pro-Western government has faced since it took over in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero maneuvers past the entire Brighton defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero got it to look ridiculously light when he scored a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attack player received a pass at the start of the sequence.
He ran around the race with three Brighton defenders before coming out on open ground.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He came up with one defender before he ran from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
He then sent a watch to the left that reached Sterling.
The English attack player used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
Aguero is still struggling with foot problems, City manager Pep Guardiola told the press.
We talked about him coming to play 5560 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky that he scored a goal right then.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the original advantage in the Premier League game.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball placed inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough pass along the left flanks to Leory Sane.
Sane had a couple of touches before he led Sterling toward the longest corner.
The Sky Blues offensive player sent the ball into the net just before it was over the deadline.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12.55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be spoiler for the Rockies
The Nationals are no longer candidates for the playoffs, and have no reason to bet strongly.
The always as competitive Scherzer hopes to still stand on the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoff opportunities of the Colorado team, which leads the Los Angeles Dodgers with one game in the NL West.
The Rockies earned a wild card-place with a 52 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure their first division title.
Even if we don't have anything to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will most likely be the highest level of play I'll ever get this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be a part of it?
The Nationals have yet to announce their starting pitcher for Sunday, but are likely to be inclined to take Scherzer's pitch in such a situation.
Sherzser, who is the starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has won 18 games this season and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump's popular assembly in West Virginia
The President referred discreetly to the situation surrounding the High Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while he spoke about how important it is that the Republicans vote at the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not a contestant, but I'm a contestant.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power at any cost.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to overcome to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, have as their goal to resist and hinder.
And you've seen it over the last four days, he said, calling the Democrats "sentient and bad and disgusting and dishonest".
He referred to the Senate's judicial committee and named the democratic senator Dianne Feinstein by name, on which the audience chanted loudly.
Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um no, I'm waiting for one. It was very bad body language.
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don't tolerate people who say their opinion
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise.
I am, after all, the last of a long line of Labour MPs to have been told that we are not welcome just because we say what we mean.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of having responsible economic policies, regarding national security, regarding Europe, ironically enough similar matters that Jeremy was in disagreement with previous leaders about.
On the outline of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it was stated that we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been just this.
This is unfortunately no longer the mood at many of the meetings, and the promise of a more friendly politics is too long forgotten, if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the workers' party, and all opinions are judged based on whether they are acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I used to think I shared many political views with suddenly began to expect me to take a U-turn and stand for opinions I had never previously agreed with, whether they were about national security or the EU's internal market.
When I speak publicly  and it has nothing to do with what I say  I get a lot of nasty messages on social media calling for my dismissal, denouncing the centre-right politics and telling me I shouldn't be a Labour member.
And I'm not the only one who's been through this.
I know I'm more fortunate than any of my colleagues, because the comments I usually receive are political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they encounter a sea of gender-discriminating and racist comments every day, but they never let themselves down.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross outcomes have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to everyone, and every motion of no confidence and every change in the electoral rules makes the party narrower.
I've received a lot of advice over the last two years where I'm being encouraged to keep my head down and not raise my voice so much, because it'll make everything better.
But that's not why I got involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a schoolboy, provoked by the Thatcher government's negligence that had led to my classroom at the public school I went to being literally bankrupt, I have been fighting for better public services for those who need them most, both as a local councillor and government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can have in any way misunderstood my political views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the representative motion on Friday, I would just like to say that as our country races towards a Brexit that will hurt individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to the people I represent, whether they're Labour or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of impeachment or political compromise will prevent me from doing what I believe best protects your interests.
Chris Leslie is the parliamentary representative for Nottingham East
Ayr 38  17 Melrose: Unseated Ayr rises to the top
Two later attempts have altered the final result a bit, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this fantastic entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They're now at the top of the table, and they're the only undefeated of the ten.
Ultimately, their superior defense was as much as their ability to utilize the opportunities they had that led to the home team losing the game, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be satisfied.
"We have been challenged in our struggles so far and are still undefeated, so I must be content with that", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "All the glory to Ayr, they were better at using the opportunities than we were.
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, with goalpark from Frazier Climo gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, loaned from the Warriors, allowed Melrose to level the position, and Jason Baggot performed an attempt without goalpark.
Climo strengthened Ayr's leadership with a penalty kick before he, right before the break, scored and scored a solo attempt to change the position to 175 at the break.
But Melrose started the second half strongly, and Patrick Anderson's attempts, with goalpark from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
That was a longer stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried out on the bar, and from the start Ayr increased the management even more than an attempt from Stafford McDowell, with goalpark from Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blain Macpherson, then got a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having an extra man on the pitch to the fullest with an attempt from Bruce Colvine without a goalpark, at the end of a period of high pressure.
The home team came back strongly, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Climo when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown at the back of the forward Ayr-maulen.
Climo performed a goalpark, as he did again almost entirely from start, after Kyle Rowe recovered David Armstrong's boxingpark and sent flanks to Gregor Henry's home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that Still Game star Ford Kieran is on his way into the serving industry. Recently, he was named director of a restaurant company with sherry provision.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC programme, for which he writes screenplays and plays alongside his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
Duen has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' final, and it appears that Kiernan is now planning the life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "living restaurant industry".
Bolivia, a landlocked country, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific Ocean
The seamen patrol a riggins-decked naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a sea-blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: "We have the right to the sea".
It is our duty to recover it.
The entire inland state of Bolivia still has a fresh memory of the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 1800s, and the country longs to once again sail the Pacific.
These hopes are perhaps greater than they have been for several decades, as Bolivia awaits a recognition from the International Court of Justice on 1 October following five years of discussion.
Bolivia has a drive, a community spirit and a sense of faith, and of course expects the outcome with a positive attitude, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the announcement of the International Court of Justice on the big screen in many different places in the country, in the hope that the Hague court will give its announcement in favor of Bolivia's claim that Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia its own outlet to the sea after several decades of sporadic negotiations.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president who faces a controversial re-election campaign next year, has also put much on Monday's agenda.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he promised late in August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly take Bolivia's side, and that very little would change if it had done so.
The UN body, which was based in the Netherlands, has no authority to give up Chilean land areas and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ruling from the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the last arguments were heard suggests that the case was not complicated, according to Paz Z√°rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than promoting Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have actually made things worse.
The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration, Z√°rate said.
She believes that Morales' antagonistic rhetoric has torn away any remaining goodwill on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Earlier President Eduardo Rodr√≠guez Veltz√©, representative of Bolivia at The Hague, rejected the theory that the court's decision came unusually quickly.
According to him, Bolivia will on Monday provide an extraordinary opportunity to open a new generation of relations with Chile and the opportunity to put a stop to 139 years of disagreement, in favor of both sides.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, had used the maritime situation as a political shallow-skull.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The recognition is an opportunity to see what we must do to overcome the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never deploy its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust the US government.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to respect the promises it made during a meeting between the leaders of the two opposing countries in Singapore.
These comments come as US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appears ready to launch the nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "dream" that continued sanctions and American resistance to is declaration that ends the Korean War will ever force North Korea into a knell.
American authorities are skeptical of accepting the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to have a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt as to whether Pyongyang really plans to release an arsenal the country likely sees as the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest in massive headaches, which are on their way to a clothing store near you
If you want to add something to your hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you don't have to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne uncovered a selection of rare, oversized head plagues as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the motel rooms at the fashion house in Paris.
Very impractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino's most striking garment was an over-the-top beige hat decorated with a fj√¶rlignende wide brake that drowned the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-pruned watermelons, a troll hat or even an pineapple, but they are not made to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also uncovered a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had re-designed lips and resembled more Hannibal Lecter than last scream.
One creation remembered the dykkeut equipment, including snorkels and dykke glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream in a cookie.
And if you're looking for even bigger fashion accessories, then you're in luck.
Style experts predict that the huge hats may be heading to a clothing store near you.
The oversized hats come straight into the heels of La Bomba, the straw hat with a half-metre-wide brake that has been seen on everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highly unpractical hat that dominated social media has now sent yet another large creation down the catwalk  a beach bag in straw that is almost as big as the bathing suit model that carries it.
The orange raffiavesque, which is bordered by raffiafrynse and completed with a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the fashion house in Paris.
Known stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the clothing stores next summer. When the designer has had such a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are crucial for world citizens
The Scottish schools are continuing to show academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with yet another year of outstanding exam results, supported by individual and joint success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (the Scottish Free School Council), have more than 30 000 pupils across Scotland, and work hard to deliver the best school experience for both pupils and parents.
Frischools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational institution that can design and implement a tailored curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and sought-after elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the words reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we can't just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's exam results, we see that languages are at the top of the list with the highest pass rates from preschools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received the A exam.
The data, collected from the 74 member schools of the Council of Free Schools, showed that 72 percent of students received the exam character A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received A.
This illustrates that schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a crucial skill children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as a subject are now valued at the same level as real subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics on the curriculum for free schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the reasons employers gave up for having problems occupying a vacant position could be attributed to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become essential in a globalised world.
If you have learned a second language, these lifelong skills will provide real benefits in the future, regardless of your career path.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey responded by more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a twenty-four percent of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investing in language learning is now crucial for today's children.
Being able to speak more languages, especially those linked to emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland, every school teaches in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach in the languages that are considered most valuable to the UK on the road to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a choice of languages to choose from in private schools, with teachers who are experts in this field.
Scottish schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
It cannot be denied in today's global business environment that language is still crucial for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
Modern languages should actually be considered as international communication capabilities.
Frischools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and excellence to Scotland's youth.
It's not fair.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (the Scottish Free School Council).
LeBron is scheduled to make his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game of Sunday's preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play is still not decided.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James will likely play a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need pre-season fights at this stage of my career", he replied.
Time of Trump's public meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President begins a series of election meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of Trump's five planned meetings over the next week, including stopovers in cities where he has a lot of support, like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his elected Supreme Court nominee is on hold, Trump has as his goal to gather support for the upcoming midterm elections, as the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress when voters go to the polls in November.
When is Trump's West Virginia public meeting tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's public meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 19 p.m. ET this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via YouTube.
Trump will likely discuss this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault.
The main goal of all these meetings is to support Republicans facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has therefore said that these five meetings over the next few weeks are aimed at "inciting volunteers and supporters" as the Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"Congressional control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we move toward a busy campaign season", a campaign spokesman for Trump told Reuters who declined to be named.
The evening's popular meeting, which according to the plan will take place at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, will attract support players from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and will be covered by the Pittsburgh press, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the polls.
"It's a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a lift on the polls", said Simon Haeder, an expert on political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show fighting spirit to keep the faith as they enter Sunday's single-game
After three unilateral sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed this year.
The swinging pendel of momentum is a completely invented sporting concept, but it's something that players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
And where do they think the momentum is now?
"They led by six points and now it's four, so we're probably carrying that with us as a little momentum", Jordan Spieth said as he left the field for the day.
Europe will of course have the advantage  they lead with four points and there are 12 left to play for.
But as Spieth says, the Americans feel they've got some wind in their sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tee to green, and leads by example.
The deep feasting cries became higher as his round continued, and sank to a decisive putting to raise the match to a tie when he and Thomas were two under two.
His putting, who won the match on 15, was met with a similar scream of the sort that shows he still doesn't mean that the American team is unlikely.
"We really just have to put all the blocks together and focus on our own match", Spieth said.
That's all each of these players have now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas during the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are undoubtedly Ryder Cup's great success story.
Europe's unusual but glorious couples have four out of four and don't make a foot mistake.
Moliwood was the only pair to avoid a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are Sunday's biggest competitors, and there are no other players the audience will see secure a European victory as the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time, in each of their holes.
It is nevertheless too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson hammered off with Sergio Garcia, the morning fourballs-held, when he was partnered with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two doubles during the first nine holes, the spanjol and the swens were so far off on the other side that they did not have the opportunity to take back the foreshore.
But on Sunday, there's no help.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look at in close terms because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can turn on a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes-√∏kten also showed that Team USA has missed the battle spirit of some, especially in the United States.
Europe leads 106 at the start of last day in the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong advance at the start of the Ryder Cup's final day, after completing Sunday's fourballs- and foursomes-matches with 106 leadership against the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led an on-off with two victories against a broken Tiger Woods, and raised their points for Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bj√∏rn's European side, who are fighting to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unlucky side in the morning's fourballs and won the series 31.
The United States gave more resistance in foursomes and won two matches, but they did not get anything back from the advance.
Jim Fury's side must collect eight points from Sunday's 12th single game to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to have four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who together have been nicknamed Molliwood after a sensational weekend, are the only pair to have four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they worked together seamlessly to beat downbroken Woods and the American rookien Bryson Dechambeau with even more after-demanding 5&4.
Woods, who held through two matches on Saturday, glimpsed in-between, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested to the morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in foursomes and performed a 2&1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked number one and three on the world base.
But Europe did not get everything they wanted on this hot day of light breezes southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won majors three times, set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a hard-fought 2&1 victory over Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team managed to pull in after a four-point advance at the start of the singles game, but as current holders only need Fury's side to achieve a tie to retain the trophy.
But after being second best for two days, it doesn't look like they'll be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea will not agree to unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened suspicion against the United States, and that the country would in no way agree to unilaterally release its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's annual general assembly that North Korea has taken "significant well-being measures" during the last year, such as halting atomic and missile tests, demolishing the atomic test area and promising not to spread atomic weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have never seen any corresponding response from the United States", he said.
Without trust in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not under any circumstances unilaterally disarm ourselves first.
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a gradual nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea is rewarded for gradual disarmament steps, but his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang had done earlier.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12, at the very first meeting between a sitting president of the United States and a North Korean leader, where Kim promised to work toward the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War that lasted from 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first release its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for a reduction in stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States insists on "atomic disarmament first" and raises pressure via sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and opposes even the "declaration of the end of the war", according to Ri.
The belief that sanctions can force us to our knees is a wish-dream for people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further mistrust.
Ri did not mention the plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed before the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months, adding: "If the other party to this disarmament case were South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have been as firmly established as it is".
The tone of Ri's speech was however very different from that of last year, when he told the UN general assembly that an attack on the mainland-USA with North Korea's rockets was inevitable after Mr. Trump called Kim a missile man on a suicide mission.
After threatening to "destroy" North Korea last year, Trump stood this year before the United Nations and praised Kim for being brave enough to take disarmament steps, but said that much work still remains, and the sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is nuclear-armed.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he didn't have a time frame for this, and said that "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council must still be enforced vigorously and without exception until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament".
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to cut off the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and missile weapons program.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said they had made progress, but just hours later North Korea accused him of bringing in gangster demands.
North Korea committed to meeting Moon this month to lay down a missile range and an atomic weapons facility if the United States made "equivalent measures".
He said Kim had said that these "equivalent measures" he wanted were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures for normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is designed to help students get more sleep by tackling the growing unculture of combing through the night with caffeinated beverages as fuel.
One academic found out that students at the world's best universities often didn't have a polling station on how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He started the course after he gave a lecture about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
After I had finished speaking, a young woman came to me and asked, "Why hasn't anyone told me this before?"
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains to students the importance of good sleep habits to academic and sporting performance and to public health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's chief health officer, said the university decided to start the course after seeing students suffering from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts for one hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, it's a picture of a room in a bedroom, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, jogging shoes and books and hear about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and how important it is to have a sleep routine.
In another section, participants are taught how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons makes participants think about their own daily routine.
We are aware that this will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know about this, just as you have the right to know about the risks of smoking", said Professor Czeisler.
There is still a certain pride in being able to pug all night, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students led to sleep deprivation being a growing problem.
Enough and good sleep should be students' "hidden weapons" against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even as a means of weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain in hunger mode, leading to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course. He took one of the professors' classes last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course inspired him to work on a course that was available to the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all master students to take a similar study programme before they are enrolled at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm for when to lie down as well as when to get up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights.
Livingston 10 Rangers: M√•l by Menga beats out Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered a removal when Dolly Mengas' goal hit Steven Gerrard's team 10 on Livingston.
The Ibrox side wanted to get their first win since February's 41 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side caused Gerrard's other losses on 18 matches as manager and left behind his eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership-leaders Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers never managed to equalize.
Rangers now fall down to sixth place, while Livingston climbs to third and is behind Hibernian on goal difference.
It may be more trouble in the gree for Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was thrown from the bortepublikum.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which featured Ayr and entered the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, however, went for the same Livi 11 that took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been happy with how his well-trained team beat the opponents.
The Rangers may have had the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They were supposed to have scored just two minutes into the game when Mengas' first pass sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder forfeited the chance.
A long free-flow of Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot against the target.
The Rangers took control, but it looked like their game was more about hope than belief in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have a penalty kick after a quarter, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected this.
Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first round, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not get any problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tamt spark from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livis' opening in the 34th minute may have been against the game's pace, no one can deny that they deserved it for the strive.
Again, the Rangers failed to handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he chose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent in the break, and the player change gave immediate results when the winger sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran off his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the away players to play exactly the kind of game they liked, as Lithgow and Halkett caught up long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched the lead in the last round, but McGregor stood up against Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers-inbyter Glenn Middleton had a late claim to punishment spark as he came into conflict with Jacobs, but again saw Thomson out.
Almanakken: The inventor of the geigerteller
And now a page from the Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the apparatus we know today as the geigerteller.
The Geigerteller has been an important part of science ever since, and also became a part of popular culture through the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What in the world is that?
Rogers: There's a geiger teller. It finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals is giving off.
Evans: Should say it makes sound now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention he named lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see cancer cells
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to detect and kill cancer cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a lab.
The cells can now see a protein that is common in many cancers, and then inject it back into the patient.
A vaccine undergoing testing has shown promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who got the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced that the ovarian cancer she suffered from disappeared for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can see a protein called HER2, which is typical of many cancers, and then injecting these cells into the patient again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said the following: "The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2 drives growth of different cancer types, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, where immune cells were taken from the patient and oppl√¶rt to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, came up with a fierce defense of Trump after the SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was curled up in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a humorous performance praising US President Donald Trump and saying he would stand for election in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he extended his hand against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
It happens so often that I talk to a white person, and then they say, How can you like Trump, he's a racist?
If I was afraid of racism, I would have moved out of the United States a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee about the accusations of sexual assault that Christine Blasey Ford made.
Although it was not broadcast, West's recording was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock wanted to make West laugh by putting out the recording.
West also complained to the audience that he was hearing it in the backroom regarding the choice of head plague.
They bullied me.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on".
They bullied me!
And then they said that I don't understand what the reality is, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see that I understand what reality is?" He said, and said that he would put on me the Superman hood, because then no one can tell me what to do.
Try love.
His comments were cured at least twice, and the employees who worked on SNL were so embarrassed, Variety reported, where a staff member told: "The whole studio became dead-set".
West was brought in as the last minor replacement for singer Ariana Grande when her girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "Til one of our bravest: THANK FOR YOU STORY IMOT THE MASSES".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just who he is and it's absolutely amazing.
But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothes or supporting his art, which I believe cultivates and spews out ideologies that are harmful to society.
He's free.
We are too, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name.
He is not the first artist to change his name and now follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg has been known as Snoop Lion, and the late Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, was the artist who was known as Prince.

The prosecution will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is extending her reach to "giftic masculinity"
Kit Harington is known for his role as swordfinger Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotype of machohelteness and says such roles in films often make young men think they must be tough to be respected.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something has gone wrong and wondered how to attack the problem of "toxic masculinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he was very interested in the subject.
"It's a lot of worrying to me these days, where did the masculinity go wrong?" he said.
How have we raised men in the face of the problems we see now?
Kit believes that TV may have parts of the blame for the increase in "toxic masculinity" due to the strong masculine roles.
He continued: "What is born and what is taught?
What's on TV and on the street, what's that makes young boys feel they have to cultivate this very side of being a man?
I think that's one of the really big questions of our time -- how can we change that?
Because it's clear that something has gone wrong for young men.
In the interview, he also admits that he will not make any forerunners or successors to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and says he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play the lead role in a new production of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was that he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife during the recording, so that way something good came out of it, my future family and my life from now on", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, who Kits role-playing character Jon Snow is in love with, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family's property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 percent increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14 percent in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, says health representative.
Around 40 000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted through sex, marking a change from earlier.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China by blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV this way is now close to zero, a Chinese health official said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90 percent of men who have sex with men, after each marry women.
Much of the disease infection is due to insufficient protection by sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, Chinese authorities have promised all people access to HIV-medicine as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that co-workers leaked data about Republican senators, fnyers of dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
Representative Maxine Waters rejected Saturday's charges that members of her staff had laid out the personal data of three Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat assured of the claims was presented by ultrakonservative commentators and web pages.
"Lies, lies and more repugnant lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information was published, which allegedly included the home addresses and telephone numbers of the United States senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on the assault charges against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a little after the three senators had spotted Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was traced to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters' staff, according to Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a straightforward lie", Waters continued.
The members of my staff - who have had their identities, personal data and security compromised as a result of these false and inaccurate allegations  had absolutely no responsibility for the leak of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a lie.
Waters's statement was quickly criticized on the web, among others by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is aggressive", Fleischer wrote.
This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they should not be aggressive.
They must not go in defense.
They must not question the motives of the accuser.
They must act calmly and wisely.
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the critics of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too aggressive during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is working to remove Waters from the midterm elections, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great" if it's true, he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted relevant authorities and police about these false accusations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", she continued, "and that they are held accountable for all acts that are destructive and dangerous to each and every one of my staff".
Report of Johnny English Strikes Again  bloodthirsty Rowan Atkinson in spy parody
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit-hintings in all new films with a British skr√•blik and it seems to be relevant to this revival of the parodifranchise Johnny English action comedy that began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self-satire about how obviously hopeless we are become the nation's new export commodity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his boiling eyes and his rubber face has been given his license to roast it for the second time. His name says more than anything else that he is a distinct and comical figure intended for territories with non-English speaking cinematic audiences.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions is a mix of Clouseau, a d√¶sj Mr Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes with one single note in the music inslag with fire truck theme during the opening ceremony at the London 2012 Olympics.
He is also originally based on the role Atkinson played in the longest-forgotten TV ads for Barclaycard; the traveling and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
It's one of the most beautiful moments in the recent Johnny English trip.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blade sliced his helmet.
Atkins's talent for physical comedy comes to its right, but the humor feels pretty bloodthirsty and oddly superfluous, especially now that the "serious" brands like 007 and Mission Impossible willingly have their own set of comedies.
The humor seems to be more child-oriented than adult-oriented, and for me Johnny English's fades aren't as inventive and spicy as the silent film lions in Mr. Bean.
The current premise is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identities of all the British agents in the field, to the horror of the agent guarding a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop of a prime minister, a pompous and downcast figure who's already going through a complete crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does a very good job with this Teresa-May role, but the script doesn't give her much to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been revealed, she must recruit some of the retired.
And that means the clown Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in a snobbish establishment, but unofficially teaches in secret intelligence.
English is snapped back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old, plagued aide Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, played by an underboat commandant, a hysterical overclassamerolle in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a waste.
So Batman and Robin's style of rooting for the queen is back, where they confront Olga Kurylenko's amazing femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the prime minister is seduced by the charismatic technological billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's cyber-problems: the lumske Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey with farce-like side-springs: they are dressed as servants and set fire to a pranging French restaurant, creating chaos while hiding aboard the luxury yacht of Volta, and English tries to use a VR-headset to make himself known in Volta's house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but even so lovely and noisy it is, there's a lot that reminds me of children's TV with all the stuff.
Quite mediocre, all of it.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets to use his talent?
Labour denies they are working out plans to let the British work four days a week, but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is to consider a radical plan that will give the British four-day workweek but get paid for five.
The party will clearly want business leaders to use savings on the revolution with artificial intelligence by giving workers an extra weekday free.
This will mean that employees receive a three-day wage, while they receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea fits into the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favor of workers.
The trade unions support the transition to a four-day week so that workers can also enjoy the benefits of the new economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: "A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits with the party's desire to make the pendulum swing to the workers' advantage in addition to the party's overarching industrial strategy.
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea.
However, the idea is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day-long strike is not the party's policy, and is not something that is being considered by the party".
Labour's finance policy spokesman, John McDonnell, used the Labour conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of "ansictless directors" and "profitors" of public service providers.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current water company shareholders are in danger of not getting back the entire share office because a Labour government can take a deduction from perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place workers in the company governments and create an employee fund to transfer 10 per cent of the private sector's own capital to the employed, which can receive an annual outlay of 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" about the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh that could change their minds
The FBI review of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the high court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the agency's findings could lead some Republican senators to change their views.
In an interview that aired Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley in "60 Minutes" asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy stood more open to it than his South Carolina colleague.
I mean, of course, Kennedy said.
I told you at the beginning of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, "Did you do that?"
He was firm, scrapy, uncertain.
Graham's voice, however, seems to be cut into stone.
"I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and it must be a striking finding", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett energetically denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people she mentioned could confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't think anything new will change that.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it helped fight poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music car event that features an impressive list of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission to eradicate world poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh year, will draw thousands of people to the Great Plain of Central Park, not only to experience the likes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to fight poverty by getting more people to work actively against poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless one is willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks, or actions, such as volunteering, sending an e-mail message to a world leader, taking a phone or other meaningful ways to raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been now that there are only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to get people to fight for change, or just another case of so-called "clicktivism" -- that people feel they're contributing greatly by signing an online signature campaign or tweeting?
Global Citizen says they have since 2011 recorded more than 19 million actions from their supporters, with a wide range of goals.
They say these actions have helped to get world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could show 390 engagements and announcements as a result of their actions, of which at least 10 billion dollars had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secured financing so far has had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key initiatives are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and entrepreneurs based in the UK that aims to help children reach their full potential, and pledged to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of undernourishment a footnote in history, Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the UK to get better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional measures.
To answer one of the common questions on the website, what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?
Global citizen replied, "It's going to be a long and difficult road, sometimes we're going to fail and fail.
But like the important civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we stand stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon√°e are some of the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could come to use the navy as a blockade to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington can "if necessary" tap into the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, the United States' interior minister, Ryan Zinke, revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria  particularly when operating at the invitation of the legitimate government  is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to negotiate energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flank of Europe", he said.
And according to the speaker, there are always ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States has through the navy the ability to ensure that seaways are open and, if necessary, blockers to ensure that energy does not reach the market", he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an idealistic organization that profiles itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
He compared Washington's ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are far from the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel", he said, referring to Russia as a "trick pony" with an economy that is dependent on fossil fuel.
The statements came after the Trump administration has been on a round trip to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, seeking to replace Russia, the far cheaper alternative for European consumers.
Employees of the Trump administration, including the president himself, therefore tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "northern European gas pipeline 2" project, which according to Trump made Berlin the "fence" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the northern European gas pipeline worth 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States' stance has met with resistance from Germany, which has again confirmed its commitments to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, BDI, has asked the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have major problems with third countries interfering with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider her 2020 presidential candidacy, says senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would seriously consider whether she would stand as a presidential candidate after the midterm elections.
During a voter meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would be silent.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix the shaky government, and it includes a woman on top", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I'll be seriously considering whether to run for president.
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the election and said he "guided the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried to the brink about what Donald Trump is doing to democracy", she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his high-ranking candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
A poll published on Thursday, however, shows that a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe she should stand in 2020.
58% of the "likely" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not stand, according to a poll by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 percent supported her candidacy.
The opinion poll showed higher support for former governor Deval Patrick, and 38 percent supported a possible candidacy and 48 percent were against it.
Other high-profile democratic names being discussed in connection with a possible candidacy in 2020 include vice president Joe Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palin's PTSD during Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being drafted in Sept.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he gets home, I share with other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and some of the vulnerability our soldiers have with them", she told the audience at a Donald Trump voting event in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrestation the elephant in the room and said of his son and other war veterans: "They come home a little changed, they come home herded, they come home wondering if this is respect for what their soldier comrades and flyers and all other members of the military have contributed to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, including reporting domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police.
18 states and D.C. support testing new asylum policies
Eight states and the District of Columbia support a legal test of a new policy in the United States that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang- or home violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. issued an orientation from amicus curiae (friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal police, has not been published.
She claimed that her partner and his violent gang member sons abused her, but authorities in the United States rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations with pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a 2014 decision by the immigration court that granted undocumented immigrants who fled domestic violence permission to seek asylum.
State attorney Karl Racine of the District of Columbia said in a statement Friday that the new policy "is moving away from many decades of delstats, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum claims be determined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition is contrary to that principle, the amicus curiae brief said.
The lawyers argued further in the orientation that the policy of denial of immigrants' access damages the American economy and says that there is a high probability that they will become more established and provide necessary labour".
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political view, Sessions said in the June 11 announcement on the policy.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all problems  even all serious problems  that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue action in Palu: deaths double in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation got worse.
"It was very exciting", says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while comforting her fever-seeking son at an evacuation center in the crushed city of Palu.
All the time you see ambulances that bring the dead.
Clean water is scarce.
One could see residents coming to destroyed homes and leaning through water-damaged properties in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were damaged in the earthquake that had a strength of 7.5, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, are outside Palus military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing strong aftershocks.
He gets tears in his eyes when he tells how it felt when the violent earthquake rocked the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to save ourselves in safety.
I was slammed by the wall that crumbled, I think, Haris told the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of "trash" with propaganda ads
A week after a public Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American newspaper that penned the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the China Daily attachment paid to move into the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of trying to meddle in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, an accusation China rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to influence the U.S. election marked a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China, U.S. officials said, according to Reuters.
It is normal for foreign governments to use advertisements to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has resulted in rounds of new tariffs on each other's imported goods.
China's penalties early in the trade war were to hit export companies in states like Iowa, which supported Trump's republican party, Chinese and American experts report.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former multi-year governor of Iowa who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reader's post in the Des Moines Register on Sunday: "China is now stepping up the trakassering by running propaganda announcements in our own free press.
By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities are exploiting the freedom of expression and the open press that we enjoy in America to put a paid ad in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
As a contrast at the newspaper box on the street here in Beijing you won't find many divergent opinions and won't experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese around China's problematic economic course, given that the media are under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added: "One of China's biggest newspapers rejected the offer to publish his article, even though he did not explain what newspaper it was".
Republicans scare away female voters before midterm elections with the Kavanaugh fadesen, analysts warn
As many top politicians among the Republicans support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual assault directed at himself, analysts warn that they will get a counter-reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
The feelings around this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given signs that they want to move on with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flakes' (R-Arizona) proposal for an FBI investigation in the last second will be enough to calm angry voters.
Women will not forget yesterday's events, they will not forget tomorrow and not in November, said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior counselor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters sang "November is coming!" while demonstrating in the Senate when the Republicans who control the judicial committee chose to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will explode", said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, to the news site.
People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among female insecure voters in the forests and younger voters between 18 and 29 years old, who often do not vote even if they dislike the president.
Even before Ford's public testimony that gave detailed descriptions of the allegations of sexual abuse against the candidate, analysts believed that it would become a counter-reaction if the Republicans forced the appointment.
"This has become a sailing root for the republican party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or final approval or whether Kavanaugh is being appointed, it's also about the way the Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that promotes the election of democratic candidates, told the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem to be somewhat split over who they should believe in the aftermath of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a small majority in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of those surveyed were completely or fairly convinced of Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they were completely or fairly convinced of Kavanaugh's presentation.
In addition, 38 percent said they were quite or completely convinced that Kavanaugh lied under his witness, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the Flake case, the FBI is investigating claims made by Ford in addition to at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford explained to the Senate's justice committee last week that Kavanaugh in the drunken state had assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the high-ranking candidate exposed her genitals while they were at a party during the study period at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology giant, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
On Solid, users can choose where their data is to be stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose is world dominance.
"We have to do it now", he said of the start-up.
It's a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to let people create their own personal data warehouses online or a POD.
It may include contact lists, work lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What's unique about the personal data store online is that it's up to the user who should have access to that kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt is according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, that the company should provide with resources, process and relevant competence to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some contracted developers to work on the project, and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not they should introduce something completely new, which will cause their business models to be completely re-called overnight.
We're not asking for your permission.
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although he is launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the next era of the Web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of Victoriakors from World War I
The only priest in the English church who was awarded a Victoriakors during World War I as a struggling priest was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Oberstl√∏ytnant and priest Bernard Vann were awarded the honours certificate on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never got to know that he was awarded the highest British military award.
A memorial stone was uncovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was a "floating symbolism" that the stone was to be uncovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's prize-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Oberstloytnant Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29.
Later, he struck down the line of fire and led the line with great courage before storming a field gun with his own hands and striking three of the divisions.
Oberstl√∏ytnant Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 just a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said that my grandfather's actions were something I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial corps.
Michael Vann said he was "very honoured to play a role in the parade" and added: "The true hero's courage is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people".
MMA fans were up all night to watch the Bellator 206 combat sports program, instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine you've been up all night watching the tight-packed Bellator 206, only to discover you're not getting to watch the main battle.
The San Jose participant made 13 matches, including six on the main card, and was shown directly through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the viewers in Britain were sitting around to measure when the picture suddenly showed Peppa pig.
Some were less impressed after staying up early to watch the match.
A follower described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as a kind of sick joke.
"It is government regulation that it is not appropriate to send such programs at 6:00 a.m., so they must be transferred to children's programs", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the program.
Peppa pig, yes!.
Bellator's executive director, Scott Coker, said they will work with the sending plan to include the viewers of Storbrtannia in the future.
"I think we can figure that out for the sake of the fight", Coker said.
But it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday there, and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday your time.
But we're working on it.
And believe me, when we went over, there were a lot of messages going back and forth, and they weren't exactly the kind of friendly kind.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't that, it was a government scream.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce from six to five matches  that we usually send  and we tried to stretch far out to the fans, but we missed.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to sexuality
Olympic stuper Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority toward everyone because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it was not before at youth school that he realized that he was not like others.
In the first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for the rights of homosexuals to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular program manager for the traditionally rich program, Kirsty Young, is due to be gone for a few months due to illness.
Daley appeared as a bit of a departure on Laverne's first mission and said he felt less worthwhile than all the others he grew up with because it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls.
He said, "To this day, it's these feelings of being inferior and different that have been the real motivation and have given me the strength and the power to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was something, he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is a two-time Olympic bronze medalist and a high-profile LGBT ambassador who used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he stands out because he feels he is lucky to live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said that his falling in love with a man - filmmaker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, whom he met in 2013 - surprised me.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
When you go through so much at such a young age -- he participated in his first Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find anyone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his whole perspective had been changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about me winning a gold medal", he said.
You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals in the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he should die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they had obtained tickets to London 2012 since he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't live long enough to sit on the front row", he said.
"I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn't invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life" "to stand in front of a home crowd during the Olympics, the best feeling ever", he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud by Heather Small, which meant a lot to him in the run-up to the Olympics and still gives him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Formsvake Mickelson took out to the Ryder Cup golf tournament Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he's got to get in shape if it's not going to be a sad milepell.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial for the impressive 12th time, was put on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's fourball- and foursome-competitions.
Instead of being in the center of events, as he so often had been for the United States, the five-time major winner divides the day between being a heialeader and working with his game on the rank in the hope of correcting what cuts.
The 48-year-old never had the best swing, even at the top of his career and is not in perfect shape for the tight Le Golf National-banen, where the long rough-area still punishes wild-goose strikes.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, will meet even British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 singles, get a successful start, Mickelson's game could prove to be decisive.
Furyk expresses confidence in her husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood what role he had today, gave me a slap on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready the next day", Furyk said.
He has great self-confidence.
He's a Hall of Famer and has added so much to these teams earlier, and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I saw more for myself, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldos' record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, but Furyk said his participation attributed some immaterial values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny and likes to have sex with others. He's a great guy to have in the storage room", he explained.
I think the younger players had fun trying out against him this week too, and it was fun to watch.
He gives much more than just the game.
European team captain Thomas Bj√∏rn knows that his great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bj√∏rn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant leadership at the entrance to the final day of singles in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Danes debuted in the 1997 Valderrama match, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but carred to victory with the least possible margin, 141‚ÅÑ2-131‚ÅÑ2.
You're still reminding yourself that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so far, said Bear, photographed after seeing Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone else on that team that this is not over.
You'll give it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus is.
I've always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of what's on the other side -- the best golfers in the world.
Bj√∂rn is very pleased with how his players have managed to play on the tough golf course and adds: "I couldn't have done it better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, it's the individual achievements that are at the center, and it's something else entirely.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, your performance as a golfer is tested to the full.
That's the message you have to convey to the players, that they have to make the best of themselves tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner, and he's also going to have to go out and get the best out of himself.
Unlike Bj√∏rn, the opposing player Jim Furyk will try to get his players to perform better individually than they did as partners.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the great upheavals last day, and was on the winning team at Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe performed the Miracle at Medinah.
I remember every condemned word of it, he said in response to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had been harassing his players at the entrance to the final day.
We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we'd like to get a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, like we saw at Medinah.
When momentum starts to go in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We'll arrange our setup and then send people out the way we feel.
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the match and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the top half of the player sequence.
"I'm betting on this group of men in that order because I think it stands all the way", said Bj√∂rn about his selection of singles players.
Germany's new warship is delayed once again
The latest frigate of the German navy was to have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the Cold War, but it will not happen until early next year due to failing systems and gallopering costs, local media reported.
The final decision of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the stewardship of the entirely new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been delayed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cited a military spokesperson.
The ferry was supposed to have been delivered to the navy in 2014, but the big problems after delivery persecuted the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class marines ordered back in 2007, will replace the old frigates of the Bremen-class.
It is agreed that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft skits and anti-skips missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods. It would be possible to use the latest frigates for up to two years away from the home port.
Still delays mean, however, that the advanced warships they were told should give Germany strength on the sea will already be outdated before they are put into service, reports Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 frigate created headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of important software and hardware defects that made the warship useless in a combat mission.
The programware defects were particularly important since vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were to be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half of the crew on older frigates in the Bremen class.
It was also revealed that the ship has an enormous weight, which reduces performance and limits the ability of the navy to conduct upgrades in the future.
The 7000-tonne-long "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price tag on the entire project, including training of the crew, has begun to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems surrounding the new frigates are particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval strength is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German government's defence committee, confirmed that the navy actually is empty for usable ships.
The official said that the problem had escalated over time because old ships were being deprived, but no new vessels came.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the navy.
National Trust is stealing the secret life of the flagger mice
New research carried out at a land estate in the Scottish Highlands will reveal how flaggermus uses the landscape in the hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help shape future conservation measures.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common flaggermus and dwarf flaggermus as well as brunlang√∏re and water flaggermus at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special pick-ups will be held at important locations around the property to track flaggermus activity throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Experts' sound analyses of all recordings will determine the frequency of the flagger musropes and what species do what.
A habitat map and report will be drawn up to provide a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS's nature conservation advisor, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to the flagger mice and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will be included in the decision on what measures should be introduced, such as the introduction of beet markets and the best possible care for the forest for flaggermus and other associated species.
The flaggermus population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has sunk considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and construction work that affect breeding grounds and habitat restriction.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, the same with fluepapir and certain chemically treated building materials as well as attacks from house cats.
The flag bear is not actually blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, they have more use for ears than eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced ecolocalization to find insects and obstacles on the road when they fly.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes flaggermus very seriously.
They have ten skilled experts who regularly carry out surveys, mapping of breeding sites and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only own flaggermus reservation at Threave land ownership in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten flaggermus species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here on Threave we have a perfect area for flagger mice", he says.
We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about flag mice, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.
He emphasizes how important it is to map the flagger mice before it is carried out maintenance on a property since the unintentional destruction of one single breeding site can kill up to 400 females and young, and perhaps outwit a whole local population.
Flagger mice are protected, and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disturb them or destroy their breeding grounds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish co-worker for the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help with the work.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our flag mice, and for many of the species, we simply don't know how the populations are doing".
Ronaldo rejects the rape charges while lawyers will sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape allegations against him as "false news" and says people "want fame" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
The attacking player for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is accused of paying her 375,000 dollars in restitution for keeping a close eye on the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
When he spoke on a direct video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo rejected the allegations as "false news".
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to tell you.
What they said today, fake news, says five times wins by the Golden Ball into the camera.
They want fame by using my name.
It's common.
They want fame by giving my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and I am well", the footballer adds with a smile.
Ronaldos' lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called the unacceptable presentation of suspicions in the private sphere, Reuters reports.
Advocate Christian Schertz says the football player will demand compensation for "damages" in a scale equivalent to the severity of the offense, which is likely one of the most serious violations of personal protections in recent years.
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 on a suite in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga must have returned to the soccer player's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to documents filed with the district court in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell down on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was 99% a good person who was betrayed by the ene percentage.
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that it was taken pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later they entered into a plea outside the court because she was "livredd for vengeance" and was also concerned about "being publicly held".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to put the pleasure aside because she is still traumatized after the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged abuse, and moved this summer to Italian Juventus on a contract worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will forever mourn the loss of carmakers
Britain will mourn for ever if it loses its status as world leader in car production after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concernful" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, they would temporarily halt production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the consequences of delayed border crossing at a possible no-deal Brexit could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90 percent were exported to the rest of the EU.
"If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, I think we will see production at our factory stop", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement as to how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, they will close the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is whether the car manufacturers say supply chain risks are present at an eventual Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "bordered" basis, and it arrives every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a border stop, which industry says could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day's inventory at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production will stop.
Clark said Theresa May's Brexit plan for further EU ties is "precisely designed to avoid such border controls".
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the moment's success, but that we seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The message, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely have to be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain.
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that increased costs on a long-term basis would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is trade union leader at the factory, said that the members are becoming increasingly concerned: "My experience suggests that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back".
A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's fateful meeting with Vice-Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be delayed for a week while the fight against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein has oversight of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will dismiss the deputy justice minister or not, and thus threaten Mueller's independence, has for many months nursed up under the speculations in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of taking up talks with Trump and attempting to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was in the process of depriving himself of his rights voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he would "helst" avoid kicking Rosenstein, but then was met to avoid it colliding with the Senate Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh over a week, which further subjected a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "There was no date for the meeting. It could be this week, but I realized it could be a week's delay because of everything that's happening with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'm always busy keeping the press updated.
Some journalists will dispute that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Programmed Chris Wallace asked about the cause.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to a lack of self-will toward TV reporters, although she added: "I am not disagreeing with their self-worth".
Then she indicated that the contact between Trump and the press would become more frequent.
The President conducts more question rounds than any previous President, she said, adding without providing any evidence:We have looked at the figures
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but if the press gets a chance to ask the president of the United States questions directly, it will definitely be better than talking to me.
We're trying to get it done often, and you've seen that we've done it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open conferences or press conferences at the visit of important people.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause, when he conducted a solo race and had at times a strange behavior before a crowd of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit concerns
The Health Secretary has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS (State Health Service) to express their country's gratitude and a desire to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish parliamentarian, sent a letter less than six months before Britain was due to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the costs of applying for residence and work permits for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "Today's negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of exclusion have been ongoing throughout the summer and are expected to land on a solution by autumn.
But the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I understand this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
So I'm going to repeat how much I value the efforts of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond are providing valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the work of healthcare for the best of our patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we sincerely hope you will stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after headache
Defence player Christion Abercrombie of the Tennessee State Tigers underwent a rush operation after getting a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported in the Tennessean newspaper.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the injury occurred just before the first round was over.
"He came out on the sideline and kind of just collapsed there", Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie the oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a bar and taking him with them for further investigation.
A Tennessee State functionary told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is no information on the type/size of the damage yet and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before finishing the game, giving him a total of 18 tackles for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher documentation fee when they buy property in the UK.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's plan to attract young voters
The document tax increase will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
Experts at the Ministry of Finance expect it to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document tax when they buy property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's plan to attract young voters with a promise to offer more reasonable housing and to frame high-income groups.
The document tax increase will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The overhead  which comes in addition to the current documentation tax, including the higher tax introduced two years ago on housing number two and rental housing purchase , can be as much as 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to bring in up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by people who do not live in the UK, which drives up prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to get their foot in the housing market.
Many well-to-do areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost towns because of the many foreign buyers who mostly reside outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson came up with a proposal to reduce document tax to help more young people own their own homes.
He accused large construction firms of keeping housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded that Theresa May must reject quotas on reasonable housing to solve Britain's shameful housing policy.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a series of proposed housing reforms, including lease controls and an end to unfounded evictions.
He also wants to give the municipal authorities greater power to build new housing.
May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions to our declining housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a living here.
However, it cannot be as easy for non-UK residents and foreign-based companies to buy homes as it is for hardworking British citizens.
For many people, the dream of owning their own home has become far too distant, and the unfair situation of the homeless continues.
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland
Sunderland's chief, Jack Ross, says his ultimate goal is to become Scotland's manager before or since.
The 42-year-old Scot is looking forward to the challenge of reviving the club in the north-east, which currently holds third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
I got a B-cap and that's it, Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I was often with my father and I saw Scotland on the Hampden as a child, and there's always something that pulls me back.
However, that opportunity would only come if I succeeded in the club leadership.
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he was not anxious to follow such established names in the big club, and has previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
My success at the moment will be measured by whether I can get the club back in the Premier League.
From the structure and facilities of this club, they undoubtedly belong to the Premier League, he said.
It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably just consider myself to have succeeded here if I get the club back there.
Ross has only been in the management for three years, following a period as assistant chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month brief appearance in Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to re-establish himself from downtrend to third division and helped St Mirren from the edge of downtrend to win the championship title the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was probably a true road boy, he recalls when he took over the management of Alloa.
I really thought leadership was right for me, more right than playing.
Sounds weird since I did well, made a fair income from it, and experienced some nice highlights.
But playing football can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to go through on a weekly basis.
I'm going through it in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management feels perfectly right to me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do. It feels like the most comfortable thing I've ever known in my entire adult life.
You can hear the entire interview on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
Perfect time for a half-liter is 17.30 on Saturdays, research shows
The summer heat wave has strengthened the revenues of Britain's hard-pressed pubs, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced a sales increase of 2.7 percent in July, while the revenues for restaurants fell 4.8 percent, the figures show.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant who summarized the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's unexpectedly long participation in the World Cup made July follow a similar pattern as the previous month of June, when pubs went up 2.8%, apart from restaurants being hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8 percent in restaurant sales in June was only worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had the best results, but an increase that was stronger like-for-like than the restaurants went down.
Pubs with foodservice also had difficulty with the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for the rastaurant drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted out to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, sales increased by 6.6 percent that month, with food service dropping 3 percent.
Paul Newman, an analyst at RSM's hotel and restaurant industry, said: "These results follow the trend we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and large sports and social events are still the most important factors in terms of out-market sales.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups still have it hard, and a turnover drop of 4.8 percent year-on-year will be particularly painful at the top of running cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for foodservice businesses, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide a long-awaited respite.
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the braking of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, industry turnover controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sectors in the UK, collects and analyses the results of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of ¬£9 billion, and is the established industry standard.
One in five kids has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five kids -- some are only 11 -- have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, a survey shows.
A survey of 20 000 youths discovered pages of fake Insta.
The news has raised concerns about the sharing of sexual content.
20 percent of the students said they have a main account that they show their parents.
One in five kids  some are only 11 years old  create social media accounts that they keep hidden from the adults.
A survey of 20 000 youth school students revealed a rapid growth in fake Insta accounts, a reference to image sharing pages on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the sharing of sexual content.
20 percent of the students said they had an innocent head account that they point to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to rape me.
The research, which was carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC for private schools, revealed that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's scary that so many young people are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the 'freedmen' in the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role on the annual general assembly of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated freedom-player, and chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those leading the sport to gain insight into her extensive experience on international level during the last ten years.
Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and worldwide freedom-seeking environment, and we are sure that freedom-seeking practitioners in Scotland will enjoy her boarding", said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I'm excited to be a voice for freestyle athletes, and I hope I have a lot to contribute to guiding the sport in Scotland".
The American won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and has won four Olympic golds. She is now a BBC expert, and after she had a passing ischemic attack, she could not walk.
She tweeted: "A month ago today, I got a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I want to be restored and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm completely fine again and I've learned to walk again, and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!
Breast pump ads that compare mothers to cows divide opinion online
A breast pump company has split the opinion online with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be the world's first soundless breast pump that is carried close to the body, Elvie, the technology-based consumer goods company, released a fresh, flirty, music video-inspired ad to show the freedom the new pump gives active mothers.
Four real mothers dancing in a loft full of high and cows to a song with the following lyrics: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see any tails".
The chorus goes on: Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my balls.
The ad, which is published on the company's Facebook page, has, however, created a storm on the web.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many say it's the beauty of the milking industry.
Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth, someone wrote.
Elvie breast pump gets a nice place in an amme-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Opparently traumatic for both mother and baby.
But, hey, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?
Another added: "For a failed announcement".
Another woman admitted that she thought the song was "unbelievably funny".
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd like to have one if I'm still breastfeeding.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a genius product, was it the one who wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun advert aimed at mothers who pump (often on the workplace or toilets) and feel like they're "whooping".
This is not an announcement that celebrates or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discrete pump in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely stationary, has no wires or slings and gets a nice place in an amme-bh, so that women get the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: "Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to put a spotlight on breast pumps and all the challenges, while showing in an entertaining and recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump brings.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a two-year-old mom appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp at the Texas border in secret
The number of detained migrant children has gone up in the air even though the monthly border crossing has remained relatively stable, partly because hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children at supporting actors.
Traditionally, most support players themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of staying in the country by standing up and making claims to a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential support players and other household adults would have to take fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, an overarching official at the immigration and customs authorities, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of individuals seeking to be support players for single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal rolls.
Nearly 80% of the people who are either support players or members of the support players household are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to pursue these people, Albence says.
The officers are trying to handle the children faster and introduced new rules that suggest that some of them must meet in court within one month after being arrested, and not 60 days as was the previous standard, according to receiver workers.
Many will be presented via videoconference instead of meeting up personally to take their case about residence permits for an immigration judge.
Those considered as unwarranted asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in custody, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to receptionists and reports emerging in the sysem in recent months.
Advocates said these concerns have grown at a larger facility like Tornillo, where children who struggle more easily are overlooked because of the facility's size.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without them having enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could exacerbate traumas that many already suffer.
Syria asks the US, French and Turkish occupation powers to withdraw immediately
In a speech in the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as vice-minister, said the foreign forces were illegally staying on Syrian soil under the cover of fighting terrorism and would be treated accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror is over in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011 and several million are on the run.
He said that Damascus will continue to wage this holy struggle until we have cleared all Syrian territories of terrorist groups and foreign presence.
The United States has around 2000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and counseling of Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
In terms of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were so good that they could return, and he accused Western countries of spreading irrational flights that would keep the refugees away.
We have contacted the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns, he said.
They're policing what's actually a purely humanitarian situation.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffersone in the rebels' last major defense position at Idlib has created an opportunity to press for political talks.
The Russian/Turkish agreement sparked a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces against the province of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear time limits" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including militants from Al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, who "will be wiped out".
UN broadcaster Staffan de Mistura hopes to call soon for the first meetings of a new committee comprised of state and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem expressed conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the committee and said that the panel's work should be limited to the "review of the articles of the present constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump wants to win another term
According to that logic, Trump would have won re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, the riksdag and scandal put an end to the presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly become the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!
At the moment, there are no signs of visual strain.
Since 2014, the number of viewers for best broadcast time has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC The Rachel Maddow Show has topped cable numbers with as many as 3.5 million viewers on evenings with big news stories.
"This is a fire that people are drawn to because we don't understand anything", said Neal Baer, program director for ABC drama "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a well-known comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi tour in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? She asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh".
There's an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, contrary to everything else on TV, the actions that unfold in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Excursion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you go a long way to being an enlightened person when you sit for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of deep diving in the background material for the book Fear, Paul Manafort's strawberry leather jacket worth $15,000 and the aftermath of Stormy Daniels' colorful descriptions of Trump's, uh, anatomy.
I don't want to watch Super Mario the same way anymore.
"One of the things he does that makes it look like a reality show is that he gives you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump's varied cast and daily twists on the plot.
You can't miss an episode, or you'll be hanging on.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was 27 degrees and sun outside his house on the north shore of Kauai, Hawaii, but he was just sitting in and watching MSNBC while he was picking up CNN.
He could not rip himself loose, not when Brett Kavanaugh is to meet the Senate's Judiciary Committee and the future of high court in the United States is at stake.
"I remember when we were making all those crap programs in the old days and people were saying this is the end of Western civilization", Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.

Money flows from outside into the most regular midterm elections for the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district experiences a stream of money after a conversion of a congressional district that ended with two sitting representatives battling for the same seat.
This recently uprooted Pittsburgh suburb sits with the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a supplementary election last spring.
Lamb stands up to another sitting representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who at the moment represents the old Pennsylvania's 12th district, which in a high degree overlaps the new 17th district.
The map was drawn up again after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts were a constitutional manipulation of the electoral circuits in favor of the republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive race for campaign financing between the largest party financing groups, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a tightly followed supplemental election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district in March of last year.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a little leadership.
The United States assessed the sanctions against El Salvador for supporting China, then withdrew the threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a heartfelt meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the Trump Organization leadership team.
Officials in the Foreign Ministry decided to call back the American diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan, said Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, in a statement earlier this month.
But the penalties were only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penal measures, which included cuts in economic assistance and targeted show restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials held a conference at the highest level focusing on security and economic growth to follow up on a similar gathering last year that was considered a step forward in attempting to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, officials in the top administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, which halted all plans for punishment against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration is attaching to the gathering, the diplomat said.
And the three American missionaries returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or punitive action from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations under the premise of anonymity.
Their accounts were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn from History
The next spiker in the box could be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible hindrance to judicial exercise, which is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller is also reportedly expanding the scope of the investigation into whether Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in interfering with our elections.
If the congress were to change sides, Trump would be put in charge of that body, amid preparations to meet the voters again and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertain factors, and I don't mean to say that Trump's fall is inevitable  nor is it for his counterparts in Europe.
There must be choices made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up against him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such vippings, and the unwilling march of democracy is accelerated or hindered.
The Americans are facing several of these vippings now.
What will we do if Trump kicks out Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hard weather ever since this newspaper reported that he last year suggested secret interceptions of the president and speculated that he was unsuited to being president.
Rosenstein says The Times's presentation is incorrect.
How will we react if the recently launched FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if he is admitted to the Supreme Court despite credible assault charges and dishonest testimony?
And most of all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we will fail, because of the experiences I had in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to the shed to light the Sabbath lights on the table with the cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not look optimistically at our future?

Rangers' Graham Doran optimistic before meeting Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday, in certainty that victory over the Austrians after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season in the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard to get to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game and thought we could get something and got one point.
Maybe we could have snapped into the end, but the draw was probably a good result.
They were probably better in the first round, and we came out in the second round and were the best team.
Thursday will be a big night in Europe.
We're hoping for three points, but it's going to be tough because they had a good result in the last game, but with the home crowd behind me, I'm sure we can stand up and get a positive result.
Last year was absolutely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but it's a good feeling now.
The team is good and the guys are good; the training is good.
Hopefully we can stand on now, put the last season behind us and get it back.
Women lose their sleep because of the fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the study had a clear understanding of how they wanted to be handled, few spoke to their families about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the kids about it.
"People want to be taken care of by someone in their family, but they do nothing to take that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not say what you want in advance.
Discussions with the counselor and family on where and how the practice should be given can have a major impact on determining costs.
Take your financial advisor with you: The financial advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for expenses.
Long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own assets  if you have enough money.
Work out your legal documents: Get rid of legal problems immediately.
Get a health authority in place by appointing a person you trust to oversee your medical care and making sure that healthcare providers will comply with your wishes if you are prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving someone authority over your finances.
You choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and to make sure that your bills are paid if you cannot do it yourself.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly parents are in a medical emergency and on their way to the hospital.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and deaths are expected to rise.
The communication is out of operation, and rescue workers have not been able to obtain information from Donggala regenthood, a region north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
The Regenthood, an administrative region under provincial level, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the economic activities of the central province of Sulawesi, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nikkel-gruvedrift is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's emergency aid administration.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic ice age in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province north of Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that struck across the southern coast. Nearly 700 people were killed.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 metres that devastated dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A grunt earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and caused devastation and panic while people were reminded of the herrings of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but over 100 were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake hits the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused several thousand tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested after allegations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-president candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested after alleged assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, cluttering a report on domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska's state police.
According to the police report, he was taken by a female relative when she tried to call the police to report the alleged abuse.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su detention center and is being held for an unsecured debt letter worth $500, KTUU reported.
He was presented to court on Saturday, where he declared himself ikke guilty, absolutely when asked how he stood up to the blame question, the network reported.
Palin is facing three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in prison and a fine of up to $2,000.
It's not the first time that a charge has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case is being heard in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, including the reporting of domestic violence and the possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
His girlfriend claimed that he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: several hundred killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 triggered a tsunami and destroyed many thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and death rates are expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the outbreak.
Several hundred people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami dundered over the beach.
Federal prosecutors rarely seek the death penalty for suspected terror attacks in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he stalked pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims foreseeably and caused serious bodily harm with intent, according to a notice of intent to seek death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for possible death penalty, according to the case document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury threw out the 22-point statute, including eight charges of murder in connection with money laundering, in the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and the wrecking of vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and purpose", said the actor, who described the way Saipov carried it out as "grussy, cruel and corrupt".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, property damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, the warnings of the forecast state.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a case that could have given a death sentence.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The first time death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple was executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on the mobile, according to the prosecution.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag hung up on the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the charges at 22 points.
David Patton, one of the publicly appointed defenders of Saipov, said they were "openly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a confession and life in prison without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had earlier asked the prosecutors not to seek death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should take responsibility for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to mobilize the people's army today during a demonstration during the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians should be allowed to feel the pressure from the eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that Britain would have been untouched if Farage was Brexit secretary.
But May's challenge to reconcile her deeply divided ranks has been underscored by pro-Remain Tories who took part in their own demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she would go ahead with trying to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backlash and force euroskeptics and Labour to choose between her package and the chaos.
Bone told the Solihull protesters that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been responsible, we'd be out now, he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will stand for Brexit, but we must reject the Brexit plan".
When he was about to explain his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in two world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone rejected claims that the people's opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: "The claim that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely false".
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration and told reporters: "I say quite simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Brexit plan is unpopular with the general public. The opposition is not going to vote for it. It is unpopular with the party and with our activists, who are actually the ones who are ripping the streets and getting us elected in the first place.
Throw away the Brexit plan and start listening.
In a direct message to May, she added: "Statsministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Farage stated that the politicians should feel the pressure if they thought of betraying the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"This is about the trust between us, the people, and the politicians", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to let them know they won't get away with it
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.'
The Remainers marched through Birmingham before they had a two-hour political rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists were siding with Tories Against Brexit banners after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security problems they had with a party app when the conference started.
These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a friction-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland, he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about the future during a meeting of the Massachusetts Council on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is up for re-election in November against Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who was vice chairman of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She has been central to speculations about whether she will run against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with electors, who have used the city hall format since Trump became president.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it's time for women to come to Washington to fix our defective government, and that includes a woman on top.
Arrestation after Sims from LSU was killed by gunfire
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting incident that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, in a news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near campus at Southern University early Friday.
Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result of it, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the spot with weapons, admitting to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without charge and placed in custody at East Baton Rouge Parish political chamber.
Sims was a two-foot-tall youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 starts last season.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton sets out for the world championship title after stall orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' stall order would play a major role in the race.
From pole Bottas got a good start and defended Hamilton from the field as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and let Hamilton continue to run in the back of the main field, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes made a pit stop a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some pushing with the wheels which made the Ferrari driver reluctant to let the inside be free after a double pass to defend himself in the third swing.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and came in as No. seven at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race in large parts while lying on the wheels to try to get to a quick finish and overpower Kimi Raikkonen as No. four.
He eventually entered the depot at the 44th round, but failed to increase the pace of the remaining eight rounds and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fabulous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who got the message to let me out.
The team has done a fabulous job to get a good tospann, Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during a politician's event on Saturday for her holding that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
When the president spoke during an event in West Virginia, he did not refer directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are "understandable, flawed and speaking falsehood".
The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you experience the mind, when you see people who are angry and bad and ugly and talk untruths, he said.
When you look at the releases and leaks, and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I haven't done that.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document -- oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, you know what?
I haven't leaked.
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we didn't leak, he added, with an imitation of the senator's voice.
Feinstein received the letter with detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked.
But her denial was not graciously taken up by the president, who during the party rally on Saturday night commented, "I'll tell you one thing, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
In his continued defense of the high-ranking candidate, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, the president hinted that the Democrats used the claims for their own purposes.
They have decided to take back power by all necessary means.
You see the madness, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overcome to get power and control, the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League-tap against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return game in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants earned a first-round bye via shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equaled for the home team before Dwyer restored the leadership for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equaled for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come back after beating Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the third meeting of the season between the teams, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyers' opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with help from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford left the game when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan led the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt left up to Cownies' equation at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants had the lead at rest when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first inning.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again equaled a mastery of 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran went together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the late second half, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth halfway out in the final round.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are playing home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers die to ensure that hundreds of airline passengers escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as the man who died and ensured that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a powerful earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to terrorise the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after the colleagues fled for life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the strongly swirling control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely fly.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died later in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We cleared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts broke when we heard it", he added.
Authorities fear that deaths could rise in several thousand, and the country's disaster response agency reports that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
The numbers are expected to rise further since many bodies are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been possible to reach, said organ spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six metres high waves have razed Palu, which will hold a mass grave on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "All the time you see ambulances that bring the dead.
There is a lack of clean water.
Minimarketes are being robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working feverishly to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready? CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, killing over 550 people.
Air Niugini reports now that a man is missing after the plane crashed in the lagoon
The airline, which owned the plane that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, says one man is missing, and earlier reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that there was one male passenger they did not have overview of.
The airline said it cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped to save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and all were stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The U.S. Navy and the airline said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the roller coaster.
Some witnesses believed that the plane had crashed on the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's a very good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others were able to wad through mid-depth water to the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said the flyers were panicking and screaming, and that he had a minor head injury.
U.S. Navy said sailors who worked nearby to repair a bridge also helped in the rescue work by using a blasting boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters below the water surface.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network suggests that 111 people have died in crashes with PNG-registered aircraft over the past twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analysts lay out the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutors concluded the procedure Saturday in a new trial for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness on the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile prints to puzzle together the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to what he had claimed earlier, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same place as Chambers's cell phone at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford entered the witness box on Saturday and claimed he was not in the city that day.
When the actor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in the trailer to Sanford that night, Sanford said he was "lying" because my trailer was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile prints suggest that they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted calls, contact details and messages to and from Chambers from her phone.
He wiped her out of his life, Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be left to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is socially-engaged hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the singer by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its origins with political messages to social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make socially engaged hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a new flowering in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Child passers-by in New York sue couples for resignation after racial abuse
A child passenger in New York sued a couple for discriminatory termination after receiving a misspelled message from her mother, who complained that she was a black person.
The couple rejected their racist views and compared the suit with utpressing.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a two-child mother, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up to the first workday in 2016.
NEEEEEEII ENDA A SWART PERSON, Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the loss, a "comfortable" Plasco-Flaxman said Maurice up, claiming that their childhood adoptive father, who was African American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for his one day of work and was then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the resignation and demanding compensation in the order of $350 per day for the six-month-long, loji-based arrangement she was promised, but without a contract.
"I wanted to show them that, hey, you just don't", she told the New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple have turned to the accusations that they are rusty and say the resignation of Maurice was the only right, since they did not feel they could trust her after having offended her.
My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist, " the man Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
But would you have left your children to someone you'd been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Come on, please.
The comparison of the suit with the prosecution's "extortion" is due to the fact that his wife had only two months to terminate and was in a "swarmly difficult situation".
Is there such a person you want to punish?
It's not particularly beautiful, the broker added.
While the legal case is underway, the people's court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticize them for their behavior and attitudes.
Publisher Paddington feared readers wouldn't accept a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was published, said of the letter: "It's difficult to put yourself in someone else's place when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know what we now know about Paddington's great success.
She says her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book by a small teddy bear, would have been greatly pleased that his work had been rejected.
She describes Paddington as a "very important family member" and adds that her father was very proud of the success he achieved.
"He was a quiet man, and he was no boastful person", she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who's doing something: you're proud of it even though it's not really your fault.
I think he looked at Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give the honor to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
At landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
Nad called regularly to say that it looked bad, that he didn't think she would survive, said Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad that said she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, Tashi, I love you so much, my friend.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medicine the doctors had given her to make her heart beat, slowly lost its effect and left the system.
She died a little earlier and her body's organs clapped together.
I just had to sit there and wait, certain that it would happen.
I couldn't scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get myself together.
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers who did not know about the trials she went through.
"No one knew", she says.
I was looking down all the time and the tears ran in a steady stream.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Postcards with mourning women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 when he was struck by depression and took his own life at 18.
"I don't want any parents to experience what I have to experience every day", she says.
Sharon, 45, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him on the smile.
They said his smile could light up any room.
He quit the job before he died because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was one of those who found him after he took his life.
Sharon says, "I'm always worried about it being a committee effect.
Sharon made the cards to tell people that there are people out there that they can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit by yourself - you need to talk to someone.
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, her partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he felt down or depressed or anything", she says.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed the change in mood.
On the first day of Christmas, he was in the basement when the children opened the gifts, but they did not have eye contact or anything.
She says his death was a great trauma for them, but they must fight through it: It's breaking a big hole in the family.
It's going to tear us apart.
But we all have to endure and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
I thought that if we could get some of what he asked for, a time- and scope-bound review, we might be able to reach some agreement, Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would fall apart along fixed party lines.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The reluctance was due to timing.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, November 6. If the Republicans presumably do it badly, it will be significantly more difficult for them to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has called around to senators and lobbyed to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley there when she was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI delivers its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so that Vice President Mike Pence can use his double vote and get him in the high court.
The number of North Korean displaced persons under Kim
North Korean deployments to South Korea have fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug, who refers to data from South Korea's collecting department, said there had been 1127 hops in the past year compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices at human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented on it publicly.
Most North Korean refugees are offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China considers the displaced persons illegal migrants and not refugees and returns them with force.
The relationship between North and South  which technically is still in war  has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks on the negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they largely agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no possibility that we will unilaterally roost first", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh hysterical and says he's unfit to sit in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he had a temperament that made him unsuitable to sit in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi came up with the remarks in an interview on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would be called hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the emotion that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening remarks, sometimes almost shouting and crying as he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He was also strongly condemning the Democrats in the committee and called the allegations against him a "grotesk and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed he could not sit in the high court since it showed he was predestined against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi nodded when asked if she would try to put Kavanaugh on the bench if he was approved and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'd say this if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he's not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he's sitting in now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals (ankedom court).
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abortions), since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the investigation, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would override certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time to send a hysterical, partisan person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it", Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
It's a just anger, months and years of mind-bending, and she can't get it out without crying.
We cry when we're angry Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's that weird, do you?
She continues: "I got a lot of help from a woman who was my supervisor somewhere, who said that she cries when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You think maybe I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry with you.
And then she just kept going.
And I thought I was amazing.
Tears are allowed as an outlet for harm in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs was in a male-dominated office, where I started crying in inexplicable rage and was grabbed in the necklace of an older woman -- a cool boss I had always been a little afraid of -- who took me to a stairwell.
"Don't let them ever see you cry", she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're bored and happy because they got you.
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he stood as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to be unfaithful to her spouse on board a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the election, Schroeder became very frustrated and thought that there was nothing in the way to investigate the possibilities of running for president himself.
"It was not a thoughtful decision", she said with a laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last they needed was one more.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign was nearing its end, she was left with the funding and swore she would not stand if she did not get 2 million dollars.
It was a losing battle.
She discovered that some of the supporting actors who gave 1,000 dollars to men, gave her only 250 dollars.
"They think I'm getting a discount, don't they?" she wonders.
When she made the speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions  gratitude towards the people who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to drive in money and reach voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism - that she cried.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown", Schroeder recalls, referring to how the press described her.
You'd think Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my gravestone?
She cried?
How the US-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The opening rates of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and even if the fight is far from over, a rift between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on important Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on goods worth 200 billion dollars, which means tariffs on half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has, of course, retaliated every time, now most recently with a five to ten percent hit on US goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has promised to match US attacks for attacks, and the world's second largest economy will probably not raise the white flag with the first.
Making Washington step down means giving in to demands, but public submission to the United States will be too humiliating for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure around the trade war with the United States can give a positive outcome for China in the long run by reducing the mutual dependence between the two economies.
"That a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions that start economic repercussions in one of the countries is actually far more dangerous than viewers have realized before", said Abigail Grace, a research fellow focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria ready for returning refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to re-establish the country, which has been ravaged by more than 7 years of war.
When he spoke in the UN National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress towards combating terrorism", he says.
The state continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions now allow for voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would take good care of helping to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that it would not be accepted conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe secures Ryder Cup wins in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after beating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the throne when the team of the Danish team captain Thomas Bj√∏rn got the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The USA star Phil Mickelson, who was struggling during large parts of the tournament, missed his tee-slag in the water at par-3 16th hole, and had to be beaten by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari was brilliant in all his rounds and became one of 4 golfers who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament got its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten out 5th and 4th by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbj√∏rn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup final.
With a total of eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind him, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the tournament's most successful European during the era with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas picked me out and believed in me.
I'm very, very happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help", said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He leaves the staffing pin to his countryman John Ram, who beat the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods. I followed that man closely growing up", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and has now registered a career score of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest golfers ever, who has won 14 major titles, only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA spent the entire weekend finding the fairways, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk declared after a disappointing performance for his troop, "I am proud of these guys, they fought.
It was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and I'm looking forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their team captain.
You just have to take off your hat.
We were beaten.
Algeoplombstring update: Concentrations are reduced in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows a general decline in red-algae concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to FWC, it is reported that there are fleck-like flowering areas in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier County, suggesting reduced concentrations.
