Obama Receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
They wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East.
But the meeting is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed Two States solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been strained for years.
Washington criticizes Israel ’ s ongoing settlement building and accuses Netanyahu of lack of will in the peace process.
Obama ’ s proposed deal on Iran ’ s nuclear program has further worsened their relationship.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech to the US Congress, which was seen in part as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting he had rejected with reference to the then upcoming election in Israel.
In a distress call, professor confesses to having shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police in a somewhat shaky voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
It was important for Lamb to stress that his "sweet dog" is still alive and probably excited, and he said that the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the mobile phone.
Inside the house, the officials found Amy Prentiss ’ s body and a handwritten note scribbled on a white block: “I ’ m so sorry I wanted to undo it, I loved Amy and she ’ s the only woman who ever loved me. ” This, according to the authorities, was written in the letter, and it was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where, according to police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10: 18 am.
He said that Lamb made the fateful distress call sometime after that.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took his own life when the police surrounded him.
A day after the shooting at the university, which forced students and faculty to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get an idea of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he had written, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty includes 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that at the end of the 2014 academic year, he was dealing with stress at 15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for leave of absence for health reasons, saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university ’ s employment policies meant that the doctorate for which Lamb had worked so hard would be no guarantee for him of an automatic path to employment as an Assistant-Professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's mind."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing the campus, police later found Lamb ’ s trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parental home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work in 2009 at the University, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring.
One of Lamb ’ s long-time friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her how to play the guitar.
He was then the swarm of women.
All the girls melted away when he was there, "Hairston, now in his forties and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon, said.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the distress call Lamb said "I have killed my wife", but there was no certificate of a marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to a bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
The former Prentiss' husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he had heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss three years ago, when he and Abigail both performed at a summertime fair.
Later they played one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainer, at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5th for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and harmonica playing in front of a sparse audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joking.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the freshmen ’ s seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and the Students ’ Committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and community members, attended a candlelight celebration on Tuesday night.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We are trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus of Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana of New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the distress call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamm in his distress call referred to Prentiss as his wife, but there is no evidence that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it won ’ t hire as many Christmas employees as last year ’ s season, but the toy and baby products ’ retailer says it will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it was planning to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, and 45,000 more were hired during the holiday season of 2014.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start job interviews this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the holiday business is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with staff to sell, ship, and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "Date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royals, and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and I gradually realize that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it comes to mind that I am a simulated yawn and an arm ’ s length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It really is for me," Spielberg said, "indisputably the biggest time travel film ever made."
"Back in Time" will be shown on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN ’ s chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" to the almost five-year conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN ’ s chief once again calls on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
It regretted that the divisions within the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "render this situation insoluble."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the Syrian crisis that they demonstrated in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 polls showing that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand him a flop.
Others have dismissed it as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But, no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top in polls, it hasn ’ t (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump ’ s double-digit lead, and some are beginning to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still too early in the parliamentary term.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at that time in 2011 Rick Perry ’ s leadership was handed over to the rising Herman Cain, none of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush ’ s Super PAC and the conservative Club for Growth economic group are now recognizing Trump ’ s perseverance and starting to pour their dollars to topple him.
Here are some recent survey figures that suggest that real estate is not just a temporary phase:
Trump ’ s popularity ratings have shifted 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll by Monmouth University showed that only two in ten Republicans viewed Mogul ’ s real estate favorably.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Now six out of ten Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures hold true in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60% of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN / ORC poll last week, 67% of Republicans said they were either “excited ” or“ satisfied ” if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of ten say they would be "angry" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they are “enthusiastic ” vs. 40% who say the same thing about Trump).
The next one in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say they would be “dissatisfied ” or“ angry ” if Jeb Bush, the establishment ’ s favorite, became the candidate.
A Republican majority does not see Trump ’ s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Republican Irish voters believe that real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News / Washington Post on Monday.
The same figure applies in the nation ’ s first primary state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively carry out his office, and almost six out of ten independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, according to ABC / Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their scholars ’ hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet, according to a CNN / ORC poll last week.
That is a change from when four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the final cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28% for the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
Yet it turns out that many GOP voters regard Trump ’ s campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some pundits point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump ’ s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head at a head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps the majority support.
He is 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and finally 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It ’ s a head para head para race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-on head-on race.
A narrow majority of Donald ’ s Trump fans say that they have formed their opinion.
A new CBS / NYT poll on Tuesday shows that just over half of voters who support Trump say they have cast their votes firmly.
Of course, much can be done to change this, and no one can really say that they will never change their minds.
46% said they would leave the door open to switch to other candidates.
Still, Trump ’ s strongest rival at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “rapists ” in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 public discourse.
Some worry that Trump ’ s bombastic language will keep crucial Hispano Americans out of the Republican Party, damaging reorientation efforts.
But, according to Monday ’ s new ABC / Post, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So, as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will apparently do so.
Frustration with the government climbs to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now receive roughly half of the support of Republican voters, mostly through their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday poll by ABC / Post that they prefer a political outsider to someone with government experience.
And they are also angry with Washington.
A poll by Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of four Iowa ’ s Republicans are frustrated with the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent “dissatisfied ” and 21 percent“ hellish annoyed. ”
Munich, Sylt & Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea Watt.
In the street, one square meter of a thatched roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the range of objects is naturally limited", it says in the study - hence the high price.
A new study shows the special locations in which one square metre costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student booth in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany ’ s top places of residence, however, the price is like peanuts.
Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations – with prices per square metre at dizzying heights.
There are times several tens of thousands of euros nix - per square meter, mind you.
But well, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is not at the top of this list for once.
Champions League: Bavaria Dreamstart thanks to Müller and Götze
Double goal scorer in Piraeus: Bavaria ’ s star Thomas Müller simply has a run.
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a well-deserved 3-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it ran.
A commanding start to the Champions' League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze gave FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the witches' cauldron of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won its opening game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller ’ s double (52. / 90. + 2) and Götzes ’ s goal (89.).
The twelfth success in a row is intended to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola will finally bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third attempt.
On his 28th goal in the Champions League, Müller received a friendly co-operation from Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto, who let pass a shot of the world champion intended as a cross.
"We will not underestimate them", Bayern's captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the game in Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the residents of Munich kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining.
Piraeus had won his most recent six home games in the premier class, including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011 Borussia Dortmund also stumbled here (1-3).
But the Bavarians, undefeated in seven European Cup battles with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They approached courageously, but often too unimaginatively in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by shifting the game to the left winger Douglas Costa, the former Brunswick Omar Elabdellaoui seldom came through.
Müller had more luck from the right when his flank from the right half field hit the upper left corner of the goal.
In the 67th minute, the world champion gave away the possible 2: 0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First of all, when Olympiakos Stürmer Ideye Brown knocked the header of the Pole off the line (26.).
Then by direct check, the goalkeeper Roberto parted with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians raised their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to punch needles.
But goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was reliable.
For example, when he shot Ideye over the bar (56).
In front of Neuer Guardiola had a chain of four with David Alaba defended in the centre next to Jerome Boateng, which did well.
Mario Götze, back in the squad after muscular problems, sat outside at first.
The World Championship "Hero" gave the green light only after the final training, said Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "Who wants to make something different from it, that is already evil".
On the first change Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the battered Lewandowski (59th).
Goetze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and cleared everything up 13 minutes later, but Müller scored a penalty.
Before the game there had been riots in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially masked Bavarians had apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures in their spectator block, the security forces intervened and proceeded with batons against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bavarian fan was injured and transported out of the stadium.
Smokers have a higher risk of losing their teeth
A long-term study in Potsdam suggests that smoking damages not only the lungs but also the teeth.
The good news is that in the event of a renunciation, the risk is reduced quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This emerges from the long-term study of an international research team, among them several coworkers of the German institute for nourishing research (DIfE) in potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, the risk of losing their teeth prematurely was 2.5 to 3.6 times higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
According to the DIfE, the main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gums.
The authors emphasize that smoking is a risk factor for this periodontitis.
The link between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay.
People who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
First author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham explained, however, that it could take more than ten years for the risk to fall back to the level of non-smokers.
One must convince humans to become nonsmokers, explained study leader Heiner Boeing of the DIfE: “Smoking shortens the lifetime. ”
Not smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health into old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years is affected by toothlessness, DIfE reported.
Earlier studies had already indicated that smoking increased the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists encounter remains from late antiquity on the banks of the Rhine at Cologne
Once again, archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site of the new Rhine boulevard, archaeologists from the Roman and Germanic Museum have unearthed skeletons and remains of historical buildings, said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of construction on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called archaeological monuments.
For all construction projects in the Cologne district, the museum is always consulted as a specialist department for archaeological preservation.
In the third construction phase of the Rhine boulevard, the archaeologists found what they were looking for.
According to Trier, it had already been known from text documents that a fortress stood on the site in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with around 350 graves had been discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman captured by freight train
After a young woman had an accident at the train station in Geilenkirchen, Lindern, the Federal Police asked the population for help.
Early on Wednesday morning, around 1.40 a.m., the woman from the station building crossed the tracks at the end of the platform and was caught by a freight train coming from Mönchengladbach.
According to the Federal Police, she sustained the most serious injuries by registering the train.
She was treated locally as an emergency doctor and taken to hospital by the emergency services.
The investigating officials have no information about the reason for the young woman ’ s nocturnal crossing of the railway.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents may have heard acoustic perceptions.
Inquired are residents or passers-by of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Information on the cause of the accident can be obtained from the 24-hour, free-of-charge hotline of the Federal Police on 0800 / 6888000 or from any other police station.
European Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
To defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration mechanisms for disputes between companies and states are to be replaced by a more transparent system, which corresponds in its functioning clearly more traditional courts.
"We want to put in place a system that citizens trust," said EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the launch.
The Swede intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA.
The German government announced support.
TTIP is intended to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people.
Specifically, the plans to reform the current arbitration system foresee that the EU and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They are to come from the EU, the USA and third countries equally.
For the first time, a second instance is also foreseen.
It would allow appeals to be made against judgments.
Until now, the parties to the proceedings agreed among themselves on arbitrators, and there was no way of appealing their judgments.
In the discussion over the past few months, it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, it says it will work towards an International Investment Court.
For example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be resolved there.
One of the main reasons for Europe ’ s strong opposition to TTIP is that investors, especially large corporations, are required to arbitrate on the basis of state arbitration (ISDS).
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, through which companies can claim damages at the expense of taxpayers, annul national laws, or enforce lower consumer and environmental standards.
In initial statements, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the proposals of the EU Commission as inadequate.
The main criticism was that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
The German State Secretary for Economic Affairs, Matthias Machnig (SPD), described the plans as great progress.
During the reform, the Commission took into account key points that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel had worked out with other EU Trade Ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French Government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against limiting the scope for action by industry by introducing too many new rules.
Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular could be put at a disadvantage.
When the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) can be concluded remained unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the USA.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should have been in place by the end of this year.
This deadline is no longer tenable.
Delicate Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago Sufjan Stevens sat on the stage in the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart, on which the shy folk singer has recorded the picturesque state of Michigan with a felt-tip pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost moved by Stevens lecture.
Using various places, which he repeatedly draws on the map, he tells us what his meticulously and delicately arranged songs report on.
Where they originated and how it looks there, in his homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderfully creative lunatic.
With the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", released in 2003, cleverly composed songs appear that nestle harmoniously very close to American folk of the late sixties, but can drift at any time into the great opulent.
There is a rumor that "Michigan" is the first part of a bold series: Each of the 50 U.S. states should be sung in succession.
But already in 2004 and close to the Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already been released and is positively breaking certain expectations.
Stevens appears reduced here.
Live guitar and banjo are enough for him.
One year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
"Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") is a widely acclaimed 2005 masterpiece.
Exuberant in ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the American Billboard Charts and is not missing in any annual best list of the influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then makes extensive use of electronic elements on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth proper studio album is still broadly orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and reverberation.
Long ago emerged from the smaller clubs, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon, headbands and large fluorescent stage decoration.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-piece band.
In the dark Hamburger More!
He mainly presents the theatre "Carrie & Lowell", which has been available since March.
Although almost 2000 guests now sit spellbound in their chairs, the considerably more mature Stevens returns to intimacy and folk.
Without saying a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the broadly enriched album.
From the audience one hears: The lecture is "more opulent" and one can "basically throw away the record".
Only for an encore Stevens says thank you modestly, plays acoustically few older songs and finally bows down to thunderous applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time is eagerly awaited
Labour ’ s new leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is due to make his debut at Prime Minister ’ s Question Time and take on David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six prescribed questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely to be closely examined by the media and Labour MPs.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some sittings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination of Mr Corbyn ’ s leadership, as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and his speech at the TUC ’ s annual meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Labour ’ s leader ’ s decision to remain silent on Tuesday while singing the national anthem at a commemorative ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is at the center of several front pages of newspaper stories.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said that he had "stood in respectful silence" and had acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England."
But one member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two Newsnight's programme that he had advised Labour's leader to sing the national anthem "independently" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadows of ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn ’ s top team, citing economic, defense, and foreign policy differences, while less than one-sixth of the Parliamentary Party initially supported him as a leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also "piling up" within Labour, following Mr Corbyn's comments on the position on the European Union and limiting profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC ’ s conference that Labour was tabling amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow of the Labour and Pensions Minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was opposed only to government plans to lower the £26,000 limit to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron over the past decade, over the dispatch of the Tory Box in Parliament, ever since he became Tory leader.
Labour ’ s leader, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has “crowd sourced ” ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both 'quick-wittedness' and barbed disputes, and has instead set out to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economic minister, will represent him if he does not attend - for example, when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He has also put forward the idea that other colleagues speak occasionally and that he raised the issue with John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics, often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
Since it was first aired on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the main barometer of a leader's judgment and leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and requires far-reaching reforms.
'Shot in Joburg ': Homeless youths trained as photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a tough place if you are homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound increases due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
The pound jumped to data showing an increase in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was boosted by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.9% year-on-year.
This percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and has provided estimates of when interest rates will rise.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and had climbed to 0.84% against the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 Index closed with a 1.49% increase to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20% after takeover of the rival AB InBev was received.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
According to encouraging news from Richemont, a competitor in the luxury goods group, the company ’ s shares were up 0.9%.
Richemont ’ s latest sales figures beat expectations and also showed that sales in China – a key market for Burberry – are back on track for growth.
Glencore shares rose 5% after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5 billion through a share sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper company Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a 4.3% decline after Goldman Sachs had "sold" its rating for the company.
JD Sports grew by 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the first half of the year.
The head of J.D. Sports says that higher wages threaten expansion.
JD Sports Managing Director Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But that purchasing power is unlikely to offset the company ’ s higher labor costs, he says.
The costs could hit the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and that could mean fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in der Hauptstadt: On Bieber ’ s Expedition to Berlin
Justin Bieber, megastar.
Lapped 21 years young, a linnet with a chic haircut.
The guy with the platinum blond hair is 100 million euros heavy.
Rather even more so.
Monsieur Bieber is currently based in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is going crazy.
Like Viktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 o ’ clock in the morning, however, the Polish woman has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
Bieber Bieber Bieber Bau: Here lives her idol, whose poster is hanging in Szczecin, since Monday night.
The suite, in which the Canadian singer lives, costs as much per day as her mother Ewa earns in half a year.
If anything.
She says: "Actually, my Wiktoria should be in the tenth grade in high school."
"I fulfill her a dream".
Compulsory schooling?
Who's itching?
The fans not.
Nor Bieber himself.
He has already ruled out.
For the advertising in the advertising break of the Super Bowl he cashed three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pimple company flushed many, many dollars on Bieber's account.
And Bieber also collects money for every doll that looks like him and walks over the counter.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, one marvels at the window pane.
He is said to have captured more than 100 million.
Some say the hype goes too far.
Others emphasize that Bieber is number one in the USA and Great Britain with his new single "What do you mean?"
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros at first.
At least he does so.
PEGIDA poster brings Lebanese to potato döner
Potatoes or Döner?
It goes both - and in the Kartoffeldöner, which the Oldenburger snack owner Hani Alhay developed.
Inspired by the slogan "Kartoffel statt Döner" ("Potato instead of Döner") on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potato and meat together on a skewer.
The idea came from a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Kartoffeln statt Döner" ("Potatoes instead of Döner"), which he happened to see on television.
Since then, his shop has been spinning a barbecue spit, stocked with meat and potatoes.
"This is multicultural for the stomach," says Alhay.
The Lebanese has meanwhile registered the idea with the Patent Office in Munich.
According to the authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
Therefore, Alhay does not want to reveal how much meat and potatoes the skewer contains.
Only so much: "It tastes even better together", he thinks.
Also with its customers the culinary international understanding goes well.
Metcash Launches Proprietary Campaign to Combat Aldi Incident
Metcash is trying to protect IGA ’ s stores from Aldi ’ s presence in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food Wholesaler Metcash has launched a roadside campaign to defend IGA ’ s market share of retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi Invasion.
While Aldi is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA ’ s supermarkets are strengthening their ties with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media, as well as events such as Adelaide ’ s show.
IGA ’ s dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands like Dunsborough ice cream maker Simmo distributing samples in IGA stores and shop owners selling discounted South Australian Football League tickets to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the food, alcohol, and appliance wholesaler will conduct its annual Investor Strategy Day.
The stakes are high as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcashs IGA ’ s retail operations and generate higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA ’ s network in the Eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial, and IGA ’ s retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that, twelve months after the opening of its first markets, Aldi will snatch away around five percent of the food market in these two countries and take away sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA ’ s retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and achieve a turnover of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and beverage business and in quantities on Metcash ’ s high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash around $13 million in earnings before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the Eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found IGA buyers to be the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash ’ s revenues in the food business will drop by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and will reduce its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash was likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglass's comments.
But it is assumed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA ’ s market share has dropped from 18% to 14% since 2010, and earnings from Metcash ’ s food and beverage business, which supplies some 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen 43% since 2012, reflecting operational deleveraging while squeezing revenue and margins.
However, the wholesaler is fighting back and is investing more than $150 million to align retail prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, and to improve IGA ’ s retailers ’ ability to improve their stores through faster growing fresh food, and to deliver a better selection of home label foods.
Metcash ’ s Chief Executive Ian Morrice said the price adjustments and store restructuring programs will gain momentum and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damages" in the recent storm around his friend Nick and according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Healy deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behaviour.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, which is often referred to as "Special Ks", came into the limelight at the Montreal Masters due to Stan Wawrinka ’ s notorious fight with them.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated by the referee twice, with Harrison exclaiming, "Wawrinka should have beaten, and I should have beat the child."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis racket after a cramp thwarted a potential US Open victory for Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in the singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cups and the semi-finals against the UK.
"One thing I'm rather more excited about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a bit drawn into the argument," Healy said.
He broke a bat when he lost to a cramp in the US Open, but he's not the first player to break a bat out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the U.S. Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him and I think he was treated a bit too strict.
He is a very mature 19 year-old, he works very hard, and he fits in the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the locker room area, he trains hard, he is in good shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take account of the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the Canberra man that he will return to the team as a long-term fixture. "
“First of all, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around it, ” Healy said.
And I believe that Nick has made it very quickly, as the likes of Federer and Murray have pointed out. He is rising in the eyes of the public, and he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions. I think that some time out of the limelight, when he can only think about it, is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is best for him.
Europe ’ s refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, withholds refugees
Hungary declared a state of emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, detaining all those who tried to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border, as hundreds of migrants piled up in a no man ’ s land, and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
The people, who had fled from violence, stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
When a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia ’ s Foreign Minister has stated that it is “unacceptable ” that migrants are being sent back from Hungary, while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
Talks with Brussels and other countries must be held in the coming days, "said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian Serbian border came one day after the 28 nations of the block could not agree on a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
The ministers, however, agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in surprised Italy and Greece, expressing the hope that eventually, next month or by the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that the EU would take in another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent.
However, Hungary did not place its hopes in early action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to close roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said that his country was also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania in order to stop the influx of migrants into the country after it ended a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News ’ correspondent Charlie D ’ Agata reported that even prisoners were used in the race to build the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that the majority of arrivals are economic migrants seeking a better life and not war refugees entitled to protection - a view that is strongly at odds with other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, make it a crime to cross the border or to damage the 4 metre (13 foot) high fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia. These laws also stipulate higher prison terms for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovac's reporters in the southern town of Szeged.
Let us be very clear: an illegal border crossing is a crime.
In procedural terms, Parliament still has to agree to the deployment of the military, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, country ’ s security adviser to Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are quickly repairing the fence.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with barbed wire arrived to close the border.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing point near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people ’ s data and squeezed a crowd to push into it.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary, saying that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary. Branko Ćopić – a magician of emotions and words
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton cut in half ahead of Bernie Sanders in national poll
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders gains ground over her.
Clinton now has the backing of 47% of Democratic voters in the primaries (58% before), while Sanders is second, with 27% (up 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, has the support of 15% of primary democratic voters.
More than five months before the primaries begin, most democratic voters say it is too early to say which candidate they will support.
But Clinton ’ s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates.
Since CBS ’ s “News ” poll, Clinton has lost out on a number of demographic groups, while Sanders made some gains.
Clinton holds a big lead among women and moderates, but these leaps have diminished.
Her support for men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind.
Clinton ’ s advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
But Clinton still has a big lead over the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by a double-digit margin with the liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point advantage with that group.
About half of Democratic primary voters across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15% would support her only because she is the candidate.
Six per cent would not support them.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton ’ s current supporters are mostly enthusiastic about her.
Views are more mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48% of primary Democratic voters say they enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say so about their top candidate, Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton ’ s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton ’ s supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to dealing with the problems and eligibility are also quoted.
With the vice president pointing the finger at presidential potential, 57% of Democratic primary voters want him in the race – though one-third believe that he should not.
If democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
Of Clinton ’ s supporters, more than half say that Biden ’ s second election would be far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton increases her lead over Sanders, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five per cent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the election; but that figure fell to 78 per cent last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that considers him the "most eligible" has risen.
Still, when it comes to determining what is more important for a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about eligibility.
Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these primary voters proves unacceptable.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, perform well on some important characteristics among their party ’ s primary voters.
Majorities regard Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest and trustworthy, with strong leadership.
Biden is the best at honesty among the three candidates, while Clinton ’ s strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% have no opinion of him.
Democratic primary voters generally also see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as ideologically aligned with their views.
In all of these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton ’ s use of a personal e-mail address and a server continue to be asked during her tenure as Secretary of State, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their overall views.
But it is a different story in the American public at large.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their declaration, while only about one-third is.
Public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the E Mail controversy had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton, though 36 percent said that their opinion of her had deteriorated.
It is mainly Republicans, more than six out of ten, who say that their views of Clinton have deteriorated.
Although Clinton is viewed by her party ’ s voters as honest and trustworthy, this remains a problem for her among registered voters as a whole: only 32% see her as honest and trustworthy, 8% less than last month, and 15 points less since May.
62% of those entitled to vote do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55% of voters across the country see Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush do best in honesty.
A majority views Sanders more honestly, but, as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in primary elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson joins Donald Trump in nationwide poll
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News / New York Times poll
The two candidates now account for half of voters ’ support in the new poll, and others are losing dramatically in support
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, with support growing from 23% in the last CBS inquiries conducted prior to last month ’ s Fox News debate to 27% in Tuesday ’ s poll.
But Carson fell from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The survey also found that Carson is well received by demographic groups, outperforming Trump with higher education among Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio ’ s governor, John Kasich, is beaten by Wisconsin ’ s governor, Scott Walker, who has fallen deepest, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida ’ s Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas ’ Governor Mike Huckabee, and Florida ’ s Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the 376 Republican voter sample in this latest poll is plus or minus 6%, conducted in September.
The latest CNN / ORC poll, released last week, shows that Carson is rising in the polls – he ends up with 19% Republican support, behind Trump with 32% support.
The recent ABC News / Washington Post poll also showed Trump ahead of Carson.
Looking at a rising Carson last week, Trump found some blows for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump ’ s faith.
“We need energy, ” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing holidaymakers to still find warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at maximum 17 degrees.
Some do not go there any longer into the sea: The water in the north and Baltic Sea has maximally 18 degrees in this week, communicates the German weather service (DWD).
The Mediterranean continues to offer bathing temperatures: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic, the peak is 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is at 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch College ’ s newcomer
Almost two years after a student died during a bullying student union ritual in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are being filed against five people.
Members of New York ’ s Baruch College, Pi-delta Psi Fraternity, brutally attacked Chun “Michael ” Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he had been burdened blindfolded with a thirty-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked as he tried to walk across a frozen field toward a target.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache, then fell unconscious.
According to the police, members of the Pi ’ Delta ’ Psi ’ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng fainted, and allegedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital.
However, they had time to change Deng ’ s clothes, google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood ’ s national president, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide paraphernalia and placed the welfare of the Brotherhood above that of Michael Deng," said Police Chief Wagner.
He could not be resurrected and died the next morning from his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly inflicted with blunt force on the head, torso, and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood. At least one student has died of the harassment every year since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also charged with harassing attacks and forming a criminal association.
"We do not only want to blame the people involved, but if there is an organisation that has - officially or unofficially - sanctioned this, we will also hold them to account", Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has revoked its affiliation with the local branch.
That will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
An interest-rate hike is coming, and the boom will falter, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will last and how long it will last.
In particular, history provides little guidance for the economy.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve ’ s aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That is why US central bank officials have so strongly emphasized that investors should focus not on when they start to raise interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants may find that the whole fuss over an increase in interest rates may have been exaggerated.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the 'cheap money' era," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to clients.
By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still at too low a level to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no impact.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy might respond, based on historical trends:
As the market saw last month, anticipating interest-rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase arrives, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for asset income to stall 12 to 24 months after the first hike, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hikes.
More specifically, over the past 35 years, the market has mostly been on an upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to raising interest rates, fairly flat in the 250 days thereafter (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the effect on the shares tends to occur later in the cycle of increase and the yield is beginning to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest-rate hikes often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed faces some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
What is most remarkable is that gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point if the Fed raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, out of the 118 interest-rate hikes since 1950, nominal GDP has been below 4.5% only twice.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, few expect this to continue and, according to the Atlanta Fed, expect only 1.5% for the third quarter.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economic setting could be risky and raise the question "is it different this time," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have braced for a Fed interest-rate hike throughout the year, and all eyes have been on this week ’ s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting, the Futures ’ Trading indicates only a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all cycles of increases from 1950 to the present day have taken place in a Super Cycle with increasing momentum in GDP, rapidly dwarfing recessionary peaks after recovery began," the report said.
By contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the period observed.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, or 74 months so far.
Fixed income has also been volatile, as the market anticipates a rise in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than on equities when they change their strategic course.
For bonds, yields appear to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the cycle, bond yields drop immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab ’ s strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds to converge and flatten the curve.
In such a climate, high-yield bonds often yield better returns, even though "we are still wary of expecting higher returns," said Kathy Jones, Schwab's fixed income analyst, in an analysis.
What is interesting, Jones believes, is that markets have already adapted to Fed strategy.
"Beyond the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there is some evidence that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened, and volatility has risen – all features of the market when the Fed tightens its strategy.
By and large, companies that do most of their business in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market, as well as financing their debts.
"History shows that" quality "stocks tend to respond extremely positively three months after an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have exceeded firms with a weak balance sheet by an average of 5 percentage points after each increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital and low stock volatility also outperformed their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt is becoming a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, said Goldman.
Beyond pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see gains from higher returns, even if experts differ on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative Member of Parliament criticised the station for its "stupidity"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said they only imitated The Brits
Parliament ’ s colleague Damien Collins attacked the programme The Voice and said that it was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" into Classic FM, a leading member of parliament claims, increasing new pressure on the station to prove that it is doing something that private broadcasters are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC ’ s bosses that the public legal radio station was “stupid ” and increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word" dumb "- but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which kicked off last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be The Brits under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you're actually just imitating what's already on the market, "Mr Bingham said.
BBC ’ s executive director rejected the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educating the public.
What I learn from Radio 3, I will not learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there ’ s a commitment to live music and making music that ’ s truly unsurpassed.
"And I think Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works is really important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it needed to work harder to engage audiences than it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of the BBC ’ s production that caught fire during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport in order to trample on the commercial rival.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - be produced "in a special BBC way".
He added that he wished the company would "find a hit from our own barn" the next time it started an entertainment series.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or to spend the payers' money on other entertainment formats.
Internet conversions rose the slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000
Sales online increased three years ago due to the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that Black Friday in November slowed spending
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain ’ s main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with only a five percent increase over the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000, that has developed over time," IMRG publisher Andy Mulcahy told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when shoppers started making purchases with their phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do it in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now it is leveling out, and we may see growth slowing.
The black light Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is cited as a reason for declining sales.
Experts believe that buyers hold back their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, the average number of buyers gathered around their computers five times to make their bargains, and some merchants ’ websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, on which buyers fought for bargains, may discourage buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that just over £1 out of £5 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made via web-based shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in downtown.
Muslims bury those killed in the crane accident in Mecca - Bin Laden's family sanctioned
The corpses of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first burials in Mecca
Saudi Arabia attributes part of the collapse to the giant Saudi bin Laden group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca ’ s Grand Mosque.
Mourners, dressed largely in white, filled the track to pay their respects as the first of the dead set out on their final journey to Al ’ Adan Moaissem ’ s graveyard.
The funeral procession passed by the holy place, where only days before a construction crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the praying people.
The bodies were released for burial when the Saudi King sanctioned the construction company of the Bin Laden family for the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 praying men who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell down.
Mr Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj.
Saudi officials have already pledged that the Hajj will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said that the Bin Laden group should not have left the arm of the crane standing when it was not in use.
An Arab version of the decree, issued by the Saudi State Press Agency, said that the Bin Laden group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The news agency ’ s English-language service did not report this detail, but said that the company ’ s management was prohibited from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to unveil what caused the fall of the crane that crashed into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Hajj, which takes place later this month.
The Bin ’ Laden group has issued no statements about the collapse of de Crans, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also reprimanded the group for not taking current safety measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca ’ s Great Mosque as part of a massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been linked to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and undertakes major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990 ’ s.
The fall of the crane came amid strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million riyals (£174,000) be paid to the relatives of the dead and the same amount of permanent injuries.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B & Q Boss says the time of cheap Eastern European artisans is over
British increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
As a result, another 200 Screwfix shops aimed at artisans will be opened
At the same time Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief, Daily Mail correspondent
It is claimed that the British lay down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen to carry out the work in their homes.
If you can skillfully use a hammer or brush to paint walls, you now seem to belong to a minority.
For Britons increasingly employ craftsmen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes, according to the boss of the company behind B & Q.
Véronique Laury, the new managing director of Kingfisher, which owns the hardware stores chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at rock-bottom prices is now obsolete.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops aimed at artisans and close 60 B & Q outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q ’ s shops because eight out of ten in-store purchasing decisions are made by women.
At the moment, men are the majority among employees.
She said it was necessary to address growing demographic trends, with more single female households doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "There is still a majority of men working in our stores.
We need to shift this more towards a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women, with 80 percent of the decisions about the purchase of products by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a British FTSE100 Index leading company, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company to have women in exactly 50 percent of the team, including its management and CFO.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year profits and sales after the group shouldered the costs of closing the stores.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B & Q, will open 200 new stores.
Officials of Aich / Dob charged with infidelity in court
On Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball team Aich / Dob had to answer for infidelity and tax evasion at the Landesgericht Klagenfurt.
The defendants pleaded not guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was finally acquitted of this charge in May.
The current trial has been postponed.
According to public prosecutor Robert Riffel, the preliminary investigation revealed that between 2006 and 2011 the defendants used funds from association accounts, which they were allowed to dispose of in their posts, for private purposes.
He puts the damage at around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also accused of financial crimes.
This fact was ruled out by Judge Michaela Sanin, President of the Senate.
It will be negotiated at a later stage.
To the rejection of the infidelity the defense explained that a financial disadvantage had developed to the association at no time.
The sports officials had only offset expenses and removed the sports club, for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, from the debt - the liabilities amounted to approximately 600,000 Austrian schillings (approx. 44,000 euros) in 2001.
"At that time we were faced with the situation: Are we going to continue the club or are we going to shut it up?", one of the defendants told us.
Together with his colleague and co-defendants, he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We advanced money, put our life insurance at the bank as collateral," he said at the interrogation.
With the association was agreed upon: They can administer the money freely, it may only no debts be made.
Furthermore, in case of corresponding financial success, the payment of the reimbursement of expenses had been decided upon retroactively until 1991.
Therefore, a part of the reimbursement of expenses was not paid out until years later, i.e. from the year 2003 onwards, when there was a plus in the account.
Therefore also lump sum and not detail deductions appeared, described the former chairman the procedures.
The accounts and savings accounts managed the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
The judge asked why the disbursements had not been disclosed to the club in detail.
The association did not take an interest in the details of the financial management, only debt relief was important, according to the answer.
In 2011, when one official was investigated for abuse of office, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association ’ s account.
These were reserves, the defendants said.
This securities account ran on the name of the second accused and was not known according to its statement the association.
"Why?" the judge asked.
For a long time, the respondent did not know the answer.
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known about this money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The co-defendant was informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "damage redress".
Why indemnify?, the judge and the prosecutor asked.
The first defendant then declared that he had not agreed with this formulation, because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what can I do if the lawyer says, "With that you are all out of the woods."
"Am I a lawyer?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he had never received a cent in salary, he had only charged for mileage allowance and diets.
As parliamentary allowance he had charged the association 1,000 euro per month, the actual expenditure was however much higher, added he.
The defendants could not provide exact documents for the early years.
These were no longer kept after a tax audit in which everything was judged to be correct, they explained.
The second defendant also received mileage allowance.
All repairs had been made in cash, and he had had to drive from his domicile in Völkermarkt to the bank in Bleiburg, he explained in his testimony.
The main hearing will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard cuts another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the staff cuts that have been ongoing for the past three years, the computer giant will cut further jobs as the company splits up.
The job cuts at the U.S. computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) find no end.
The US-based technology group is planning to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate client division as part of its restructuring.
This is expected to save costs of 2.7 billion dollars (2.4 billion euros), the company announced on Tuesday.
The move would lead to a special burden of around 2.7 billion dollars, which would accrue from the fourth quarter onwards.
The dismantling of 55,000 jobs that has been going on for three years is not yet complete.
HP still had around 302,000 employees at the end of fiscal 2013 / 14.
In the post-trading period, the Hewlett-Packard-Shares declined by 2.3 percent.
The company from Palo Alto, California, which grew up with printers, is currently splitting up: the computer and printer business is to be pooled in a new company this year - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services.
Both parts of the business are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A again disappointing PC paragraph as well as a weaker demand of enterprise customers for its services set the world-wide second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo recently.
In the third quarter at the end of July, shipments of personal computers and printers declined 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.4 billion dollars.
Revenues decreased in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP is responding with a split and massive job cuts to the industry ’ s transformation.
The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, has only reacted late to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and that more and more businesses are doing business online.
Whitman ’ s restructuring plans envisage a total reduction of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority supports anti-IS training mission
A direct participation of German soldiers in hostilities in Iraq would, however, meet with predominantly negative reactions: 54 percent spoke out against it, 35 percent were in favour.
61 percent think it is positive that other states are launching air strikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.
24 percent are against intervening in the conflict.
51 percent of respondents reject a cooperation with the Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad, 20 percent would be in favour.
29 percent could not decide.
Auto: Second press day at the 66th IAA
Until 27 September, the focus of the trade fair will be on connected, self-driving cars and electromobility.
After two press days, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition on Thursday under the motto "Mobility connects".
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday onwards.
As two years ago, the organizers of the German Association for the Automobile Association (VDA) expect about 900,000 visitors.
Röszke: Violence on Serbian border
The Hungarian police have used tear gas and water cannons against several hundred indignant refugees at the Serbian border near Röszke.
Euronew ’ s correspondent Dániel Bozsik witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by telephone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
Behind it a police line had formed and behind the police stood a water cannon ready.
Forty to fifty refugees began throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officers initially used continuous pepper spray.
The police then used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
Thus the group was disbanded.
The refugees have now withdrawn a little while waiting.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried out of the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees collapsed and suffered from shortness of breath.
The press officers of the Serbian police also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of Decision on Interest Rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching when the US Federal Reserve meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists interviewed by Reuters found that a little more than half of those who thought last week that the Fed would do so now think that the Fed will stay a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0-0.25%.
It is a historic event because it is seven years since the Fed set interest rates on zero.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may be leaving the zero zone and starting a process of interest-rate normalization," said Angel Ubide, senior executive at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is at a relatively good performance level, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
But the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global affairs.
It has warned markets to prepare for an increase, but the evidence suggests that the odds against such a move are good.
The decision will be announced at 20: 00 CET on Thursday
Death shooter at Delta State University left apology
After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later in the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" at the first murder and wanted to "undo it", authorities announced on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, a lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number around 10: 00 a.m. Monday morning
and said he had shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency call centre employee that the police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that there was a "sweet dog" in the house, but "nobody will disturb", but he will probably be upset.
The police asked the caller his name, but he did not give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm so sorry I wanted to undo it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me. "
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday night when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's mind."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities on Tuesday said there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangular relationship".
Prentiss was described as a "good person" by Shawn O'Steen, who testified that they had been married for about seven years.
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19 and she was "devastated".
He said that her daughter Prentiss were "absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, had been meeting Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people", said Knowles
Police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them that "he is not going to prison."
When police caught him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the woods, and killed himself with a shot.
In the spring of 2015, Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University, as stated on the university ’ s website.
Stars who have lost their lucky charm
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor is also allegedly struggling with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All this certainly takes its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa restructuring the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major corporate restructuring.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organization alone.
The restructuring of the Group will cost 150 of the approximately 1000 managers worldwide their jobs.
There are, however, new negotiations with the pilots' union.
Lufthansa is restructuring its corporate structure and upgrading its low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.
The goal of the realignment is a profit contribution of around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, there will no longer be a Executive Board member responsible for passenger business at Lufthansa.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In the future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the management team headed by Carsten Spohr.
With this realignment, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organisation of the 120,000 strong company has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passenger Airline Group, which accounts for three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective bargaining dispute with the Cockpit pilots' association (VC), negotiations are to be resumed after the strike stopped by the courts this Thursday.
The union announced this.
The talks will focus on the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to come "in a year with a predicted record result" as soon as possible to sustainable results.
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional provision of the pilots, the background is the savings concept "Wings".
It provides for Lufthansa to outsource routes to its own low-cost airline Eurowings in the fight against competitors.
Under the title "Morning Train to the South", paintings by Leena Krüger can be seen in the Künstlerhaus.

Luke Shaw from Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Champions' League in Manchester at the PSV Eindhoven.
While this made the left winger cry and will keep him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV team.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being hospitalized.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It is terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, has it very hard and then plays fantastically, and then that happens.
In the changing room he had an oxygen mask on.
He cried.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it takes six months and he will not play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of an elevenmeter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account said: "I thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my recovery is starting now, I'm coming back stronger."
Related to this: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at the PSV
With the European Championship in France, England ’ s defenseman has an additional incentive to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said, "It's a very serious injury."
When a player leaves the pitch with this type of injury, they are all very sad.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when Mexico played against Van Gaal ’ s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
“He ’ s having a hard time because it wasn ’ t his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you hear it ’ s a very bad injury, it ’ s not good, ” Cocu said.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad about it. I am so sorry.
PSV team player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a foul of Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
It is something all parents will soon learn: if your child loves a book, it won ’ t be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you are perhaps David Cameron.
When he was asked by a childcare provider to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, the 1971 published environmental fable by Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read to my children, because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far."
All well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead reproduces a synopsis of the 2012 version of the film, adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the middle of the walled city of Thneed, Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss hostage and who died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if that wasn ’ t suspicious enough, Cameron ’ s text partly reads like the summary of the Lorax film presented on the Internet Movie Database ’ s website and begins: “In the walled city of Thneed ’ Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams. ”
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the story of the book. Here, an unnamed boy hears how the local environment is ravaged by the money-hungry, tree-felling thneed knitting once-ler, despite protests from name-giving Lorax, a squatting, moustachioed creature who "speaks in the name of the trees."
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing ’ Street spokeswoman said that the text probably came from Cameron ’ s constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron ’ s staff, but made no further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened with expulsion from England, but it is still difficult
Finding Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you look at the squad England has selected for the tour, a repetition of the three 0 test series is not on my map.
I would not rule out an away victory.
Alastair Cook ’ s side may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there ’ s good spin, players in the batting line-up, and the community spirit is strong; they won ’ t carry scars from 2012, just a youthful and positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin, Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown quantity on test level, is an option for the attack.
News Relating to this: Adam Lyth retires from England and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to skip Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult for me as his head coach in Yorkshire to analyse.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but tough reality is that cricketers are focused on results.
There were no question marks with Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because - and I said this earlier - players are their own best selectors.
Long ago the run of Lyth would have been prolonged, but he had control over his own fate.
If he hopefully pulls out more runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
England ’ s head coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he didn ’ t perform so well, and that doesn ’ t surprise me; he ’ s mostly a team man.
The question of how much time a test is given to a batsman to set his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away games.
The only charge that could be made was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in top form - but that lost opportunity now lies in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he ’ s a hitman that I value highly.
He ’ s an X ’ factor umpteen cricketer, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge course, which hit us hard.
He must be given at least the same chances as those before him, but of course this depends on the team line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of making Moeen beat next to Cook, which would provide an extra spin, Bowler and four Quicks, emerged, and I have nothing against it.
I don ’ t see why a batsman can ’ t beat there, and this left-hander has already shown himself to be a vicious cricketer.
Moeen may not have done his job for his county of Worcestershire, but is he a number 3 for them, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before appearing as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs at once and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he has impressed me a lot as a young man.
People might look at his stats – an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball – and think it ’ s a punt, but there isn ’ t a large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as advisor for the test games could be a masterstroke.
He is one of the nicest guys of the game who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood arrives for the white ball “phase of the tour ” and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup.
I have always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or coach, and like Mahela he has insights from which we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring a breath of fresh air, even if the news is in line with what was said earlier.
Collys teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with that.
Some may disagree, but coaches and team stand-ups do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made lightly.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = the UK leaving the EU) could gain ground if the economy goes into a slump by 2017
David Cameron's ill-conceived renegotiation of his strategy to keep Britain in the EU will run deeper and deeper into trouble every day, even without the election of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn as leader of Labour or the TUC, which clashed fiercely over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn ’ s and Nigel Farages ’.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some member states, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is and not always out of their own fault, are fed up with Britain ’ s self-made agenda with split concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they mostly don ’ t want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that they did not like the idea of endangering social protection.
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie ’ s agenda.
Prime Ministers and finance ministers climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local greats, then come home and say they are winning allies for reform.
It is always about me.
My European friend, who wants an outward-looking UK inside the EU tent - 'Don't leave us alone with France', says Berlin - and makes it clear that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have reached the point where they don't care whether we stay or leave.
Germany ’ s cautiously level-headed Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before things look bad for her, as happened to the excessively long-drawn-out like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14), and Kohl (16).
France ’ s François Hollande is looking forward to his re-election or replacement in 2017.
It is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, and Spain a left-wing one.
It is hard to imagine them pulling out a leg to help selfie the British, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don't want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
As a result, some such ministers may even be intentionally planning unhelpful remarks, SNP style, during Britain ’ s 2017 referendum campaign to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a default," and "Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at its expense, and which EU skeptics are the oligarchy of press barons, as they were not during the Tony Benn-inspired referendum in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 at a ratio of 2: 1.
You may have a faint memory of Boris Johnson, the ore "Euro" opportunist, who made a name for himself as an "EU Straight to Bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 90's.
For all his folly, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
These included the medley of tax fearful rogues, telephone hacking foreigners, and the pseudo non-nationals who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought of them in a similar way, but found that, when you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, it is better to distribute bananas to distract him rather than become his lunch and dinner.
Indeed, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself in resisting Cameron ’ s referendum flurry, because Blair had put the principle above the EU ’ s unenacted constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, opening a back door.
The press has never forgiven him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on the back in Westminster Monday - I told him he didn't need to waste any more time for me - seems at risk of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80's, a mistake then and now.
It may take, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC ’ s sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn ’ s official position on Europe is, to put it mildly, in development.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional blue dye "tendency" and the wilder realms of Tory's Klein "Englishism can probably say yes to it.
It is what Hilary 'Ein Benn, aber kein Bennite' Benn said on radio and television this week as the Boy Scout was struggling in him not to admit that Corbyn's provocative appointment of John McDonnell as Shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father tried on television to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to stay 'at all costs' - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow combatants and MEPs according to all the reports at their conclave meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever the stirring bottom of Corbyn ’ s “Up ’ up ” image – remember that it even touched me – news discipline remains important in the age of television around the clock, and especially in the vortex of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that allows him to take Labour's support for the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn ’ s fundamental ambiguities about EU membership – in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past – are no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central principle of dogmatic strife.
As with his ambiguities about NATO – Tom Watson firmly believes that JC will not launch a campaign to quit – foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of everything at home for their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have distrustful voters - to make concessions to the British, if all this can be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cut in Tory ’ s government ’ s costs in power, which I was reminded of at the start on Monday of what was called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
Claims by a government-funded agency that cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined Lancet in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "Policy Report" last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
But some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy basis" on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the claims "are based on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy."
They said that the public expects PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that E" cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking "to be based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who have been convened to develop a model for a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), in order to synthesize their opinions on the damage of various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO is said to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said they would receive funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but did not add to the funding he reportedly received previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reasons for the selection of members of the board are not supplied, but these include several well-known E ’ cigarettes ’ champions, some of which also specify an industry ’ s financing in the paper.
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the Tobacco Directorate of PHE.
The group ’ s research “significantly ” admits that there is a lack of“ hard evidence for the damage of most products under most criteria, ” wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these compounds or limitations are discussed in the PHE's report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "so far there is no evidence that E" cigarettes serve as a route to smoking for children or non-smokers "were premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Wellbeing at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been reacted to.
He said: "E" cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking.
Every second smoker dies of addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of cigarettes are small in comparison, but that we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what is and is not proven, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related disease, and smoking costs the national health system £2 billion a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national responsibilities.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would “give their right arm ” for hit shows like the Albert Square soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK ’ s broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for having to place publicly available legal programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in hard-won timeframes against the most popular shows of their rivals and broadcasters such as BBC4.
After BBC Director General Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had spent six years in Channel 4 trying to get in touch with the BBC without success.
“I have problems with the idea that BBC commissions or broadcasts programs that would also clearly be shown by unsubsidized rivals, ” Johnson told the House of Lords ’ communications committee as part of its investigation into the BBC ’ s future.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least produce it on programmes that others do not make or commission.
They send The Voice in a first-class time slot because they want to achieve the broadest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is of course nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax would finance programs that could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.
Frankly, other channels would give her right arm.
I am trying to see how this is to be public television.
I do not think that would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame for the ratings hunt “because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support. ”
His comments on the BBC ’ s most popular shows reflect what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh that the BBC shows should sell like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public-sector legal niche programs “should go to BBC4, where you can ’ t pretty much measure the audience, but they do their jobs, and they can argue if they go on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion in broadcasting fees, ”“ Well, of course, we ’ ve created all those obscure programs that no one has seen. ”
They put it in a time window where no one ever wanted to see it.
On the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: "I call on you to find a more regressive system of terms and conditions on who can get the best value out of it.
Of course, you all think, we all think, that you get a lot of value here for £150 a year, but for people who are a lot of money for £150, I wonder if that ’ s true, because they don ’ t consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 executive David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian ’ s mission “to inform, educate and entertain. ”
He said little of the BBC ’ s production is now officially classified as education – he said that it is 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on the radio – and she should take an example from the public television channels in Australia and Canada to change this into “inform, educate and entertain. ”
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of Proms, of which he said that only a handful will be shown on television, and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
Sonogenetics can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by sound wave outbreaks.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by switching on motoneuron ， cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane ， channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method, called Sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the method might one day replace the Deep Brain Stimulation, an invasive method that emits electrical impulses into people ’ s brains to treat the symptoms of Parkinson ’ s Disease.
Threadworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP, or 4, ion channels found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves open up these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report by Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasound, controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP, or 4, ion channels.
When he applies ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted to the worms, where they turn on the altered motor neurons.
The process has some similarities to Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to turn neurons with pulses of light on and off.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
In contrast to light, which has to be sent down to the desired location in the brain via an optical fiber, ultrasonic waves can pass through tissues unhindered and can thus be sent into the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

The Ads Shame Britain ’ s Arms Trade
Amnesty International Anti-Weapons Fair Watch Video.
Terrible killers, drones!
ankle shattering leg shackles!
Cluster bombs!
And electric batons that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world ’ s largest arms show is a bellicose parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government ’ s willingness to sell arms to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London ’ s Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the underground trains and require a second look.
"Important announcement: Will you be travelling on DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) can be read in the fonts of the London Underground and the hallmarks of the DLR Line-changing into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will be driving with DLR... Customers are asked to help stop the arms show.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy ’ s Dismaland.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a £6 pack of Allen keys that are claimed to "gain access to around a third of the bus stops" on the planet.
Transport for London does not find this poster "vandalism" funny.
A parody of the advertisements that was produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more critical and trying to bring political work to audiences outside of galleries.
Many artists get to work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the anti-arms trade posters greets the commuters in the underground train.
Amnesty ’ s video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profit with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works free of charge.
VCCP ’ s creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence surrounding the arms show promotion – through a blank space in the ExCeL ’ s calendar – and thought, “Let ’ s give them the campaign they ’ re trying to avoid. ”
They played with the invention of a more realistic seedy corporate advertisement, but "by infusing it with bright colors and animation it sticks stronger."
"They have done a fantastic job of helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," says Amnesty's Tom Davies.
What we need now is action by the British Government to ensure that torture equipment is not traded illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from within ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the US Army for "the AT4CS RS shot down from the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead that delivers outstanding repercussion effects inside the target."
Whatever that does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Residences
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgetful nineteen-year-old, I moved into a dormitory, still believing in Beret ’ s and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I have annoyed – and the many long-winded complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving into student residences ranges from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely frightening.
It's tempting to chat: people tell you where you come from, if and where you took sabbatical, where you stand in relation to Corbyn, and why you "honestly neither love nor hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find out the people you like as opposed to those you would not talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those were fire extinguishers.
Let people.
People ’ s rooms often turn into beverages, movie nights, and community meeting places, but they are also the places where people dress and dress up.

Introvert receive a rough treatment at the university.
Their room was supposed to be a refuge, but many student residences form a home to a home, with a friendly and social culture that can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away to get the energy back that I have spent interacting with you."
Try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by conviviality - and send him an SMS instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
A guy in my dormitories had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Make friends by baking.
As you begin the university at the height of back-and-forth mania, knocking on the doors of people to imagine a plate full of brownies is less strange than welcoming the 1950 ’ s “Welcome to the neighborhood, I ’ ve baked you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions. ”
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to converse and may end up associating your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to fall asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Of course, the claw of chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check with the milk owner.
Chances are that they will say they serve themselves even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your things, it is annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it in a more balanced way than my roommate, who added a detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She is now in prison.
They should not make noise that keeps people away from sleep or work.
It is not just a matter of being a decent person, but that you are, in the truest sense of the proverb, one of the people sitting in the glasshouse.
A girl in my corridor asked her neighbors if they mind making Drum & Bass a little quieter, because it was three in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for another two hours before she blared her own music, locked her door, and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn ’ t it be romantic if your future spouse moved into the same dormitory by chance?
Conversely, wouldn ’ t it be profoundly embarrassing if you took a roommate for your future spouse, got up to her, separated again, and then had to see her every day and perhaps see how she pulled all the friends together over to her?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to make your abdomen reason a little.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between an ulk and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it only takes moments before it becomes a boomerang.
Teach a valuable and amusing lesson about safety by hiding - but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock your door and put your keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't grab your possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Row houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds terraced houses in Eckental in central Franconia for people who do not have much money.
For refugees, for example, but also as a signal: "It is not only refugees who need room to live, but also the single mother and the low-income earner."
"I show how you can build well and cheaply even today", says the 44 year old in an interview
Thousands of refugees will enter the housing market.
Entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how quickly cheap housing can be created: he is building row houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will enter the housing market.
Which solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gymnasiums has no sustainability.
Because people stay here to a large extent.
In view of the influx of refugees, we will also need sufficient housing in the coming decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when you put people in apartment blocks.
Each of the six houses under construction in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.
It may be that many refugees will say it is peace again, I am going back.
Then the houses can be easily converted according to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros, excluding land.
That is manageable.
The construction took six months.
That is appropriate.
Did the building regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: In terms of construction law, I carried out my project correctly.
Particularly complicated it always makes the threatening special construction Damoklesschwert and the parking lot regulation.
Creepy.
It is still assumed that whoever creates three apartments in a terraced house needs at least three parking spaces.
Only in the cities is there no room for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house?
Gildner: There were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But are you not intensifying the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: It ’ s true: We ’ ve had a building boom in Germany in the last five years, but we ’ ve built luxury apartments that hardly anyone can afford anymore.
My project has the message that even ordinary people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also single mothers or low income earners.
I will show you how to build well and cheaply.
That is what it is all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems engineering in Regensburg and initially worked on environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone ’ s operating system when Apple ’ s update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app, tapping on "General" and then selecting "Software ， Update".
When it ’ s ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install it.
Some have encountered problems after installation because they get an error message that says "Software update failed".
To work around the problem, users are advised to either wait until the rush decreases or try updating via iTunes.
The phone itself guides you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to make room - but Apple has made this less likely by streamlining the update. Likewise, it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your phone is charged during the upgrade or is near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may shut down halfway and this could cause the update to stop.

You should also make sure that you have reviewed our checklist of all things before downloading to prevent things from going wrong and to protect yourself if they do do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and tremendous new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that speed up and repair the operating system.
Rosberg ’ s only motto: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg has only one motto left in the fight for the Formula 1 World Championship title against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Full Attack".
Before the start of the decisive seven overseas races, the World Championship in second place emphasized "that I have nothing more to lose".
53 points separate the runner-up before the Singapore night race from defending champion and two-time champion Hamilton.
The Briton has already won seven of the previous twelve races of the season and is also attacking the floodlit Grand Prix as the favourite in the city state.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Briton won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city-state will influence the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a haze bell has hung over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Schachclub has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", which was founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player, who stayed more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen for a cure.
Gauselmann is bearer of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation, which chairman Alfred Klein accepted.
This makes it possible to accommodate chess players who cannot afford the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search will also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club "Red White" is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town.
Quartiersbüro searches direct contact
Saludis and the Antonistift Retirement Centre have joined forces under the umbrella of the Social Foundation and have opened a new contact point at Graf Stauffenberg.
In addition to consultations, you can also participate in courses there.
The Social Foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city centre.
More precisely, to the Count of Stauffenberg.
A new district office was recently opened there.
Here, directly beside the purchase market, seniors and advice-looking for receive immediately information to questions like to the care insurance or to achievements of the health and care cashes.
For years, we have been using our outpatient care service to establish that caregivers are often left alone.
There are endless questions.
"Also often many achievements of the cashes are not taken up, because the complexity of the insurance is hardly understood any longer", described the new Hausherrin Jutta Weigand, which is responsible as division chief old person assistance also for the Antonistift and the citizen hospital as well as for the ambulatory service “Amadeus ”.
In addition to consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this, the Saludis was taken on board.
Therefore one can use additional offers like fall prevention, memory training or a physiotherapeutic treatment.
The services of the Senior Centre and the Saludis complement each other perfectly.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The Senior Care Center", Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis, described.
Both managing directors see the reason for the opening of the new quarter office in the city center particularly in the demographic change.
This will make a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined at the inauguration ceremony, the district office is also dedicated to loneliness in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social gathering."
Thus the social donation makes a large contribution that seniors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar surrounding field.
The Quartiersbüro is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 o'clock, Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o'clock and on Saturdays from 10 o'clock to 12 o'clock.
Eintracht Bamberg vs. Würzburger Kickers on October 6
Now it is official: After the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third division soccer club Würzburger Kickers had not yet been specified because of reorganization work at the Fuchsparkstadion, now 6 October was specified as date.
The meeting of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth-finals of the Bavarian Football Totopokal against the third division club FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finally scheduled.
The match will take place on Tuesday, October 6, at 7pm in the Bamberg Fuchsparkstadion.
“We are glad that we know now, when the play goes over the stage, now we have planning security ”, so FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, which refers also to the ticket advance sale begun now.
It is something special for our team to play against a third division side.
We therefore hope for a large number of spectators, and not without reason, because floodlighting plays have a special appeal.
FC Eintracht Bamberg entered the round of the last 16 teams in 2010 by victories in the district league 1. FC Oberhaid (3: 1) and at home against the regional league 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3: 2).
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 euros and qualify for the first round of the 2016 / 2017 DFB Association Cup.
Defending champion SpVgg Unterhaching is third division relegated.
Viennese architect Karl Mang died at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on 5 September at the age of 92, as the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Kuenstlerhaus lost an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as stated in the press release.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna under Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
From 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer and director of the institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned with the establishment of the Imperial Treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and the conversion of the Lobkowitz Palace into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Parking penalty: Tim Wiese throws money at policewoman
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has been noticed in Bremen bad.
A former footballer, Tim Wiese is now former national goalkeeper in Germany and a wrestler with Bremen and Hoffenheim.
According to his own statement, he claims to have gained 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years.
Intellectually, however, he has not grown.
Wiese had his hair cut in the city centre of Bremen when he saw a parking garage guard outside issuing a parking ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
As a result Wiese stormed out of the shop, insulted the officer and threw the due fine at her feet, as the "Bild" newspaper reports.
The city of Bremen confirms the accusations, but is not yet aware of the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under examination", it says of the city of Bremen.
Only then will it be decided whether meadow is displayed or not.

Men beat up on 17-year-old Afghans
Police are looking for witnesses for an incident in Bad Soden, near Salmünster. On Friday evening, around 11.45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
According to the police, one of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called out to them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the same level as the petrol station.
There were also three people on the site of the gas station.
One of these men now shouted at the young man and slapped him in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a broken nasal bone and bleeded heavily from her nose.
When his two friends hurried up and appeased the thug, the latter at first gave up on his victim.
The injured young man was brought home by his friends.
The perpetrator pursued the group with a car to their apartment and drove demonstratively several times over there.
When the vehicle was no longer visible, the injured man went outside the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the thug and another male person.
A baton was used to beat the victim's face and thighs.
The injured man had to be taken to hospital for medical care.
So far there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second bat is said to have been about 1.65 feet tall and was dressed in a pair of jeans and a brown and white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and whistleblowers to call 06181 / 100, 123.
Dr. Frank Müller acquires Felstehausen practice and invests EUR 310,000
Silvia Müller, Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Also Samtgemeindebürgermeister Bernd Bormann, Wirtschaftsförderin Uta Seim, Schwartz and Asendorf's mayor Heinfried Kabbert are pleased about this.
In many villages in the country doctors are missing - Asendorf on the other hand has luck: There Dr. Frank Mueller takes over on 1 October the practice Felstehausen.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl, Heinrich, will still be at his successor ’ s side with half a job in the coming months.
After a renovation phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, by then investing €310,000 in the premises at St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathetic at first sight when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller in Gongoll years ago, who is currently completing her specialist training at the hospital in Verden and will also be entering the practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice", says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it happened, I just called her".
The Müller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and the constant contact to the patients are very attractive for us", says the 39-year-old miller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years".
He also sees the advantage of soon being his own boss.
And so it was agreed that the Müllers bought the house with practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen in Vilsen.
The father of two, Frank Müller, also grew up there. His medical studies in Hanover were followed by postings in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
Currently he is working as a senior physician in Sulingen, he was also appointed in 2009 to the senior emergency doctor in the district of Diepholz and volunteered in the DRC, Willingness Bruchhausen Vilsen.
From 19 September, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl Heinrich Felstehausen works as a family doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) has specialized in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as family doctors.
"The endoscopy comes out of it", says the 38 "year-old Silvia Müller" Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a more consultation room.
In addition, the IT will be completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a grant of a total of 50,000 euros from the district (25,000 euros) as well as from the joint municipality (12,500 euros) and the municipality (12,500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is being continued," said Mayor Bernd Bormann.
About 2000 Patients come, according to Silvia Müller, Gongoll every quarter in the practice Felstehausen, in the northern German average practice is about 500.
In Asendorf there is another family doctor's practice.
A positive side effect of the practice assumption by franc Mueller: The pharmacy remains according to Ursel felstehausen in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, it would have gone.
By the way, those who visit Müller ’ s office hours will continue to look into familiar faces: they will take over the seven medical employees and the cleaning staff from the Felstehausens.
With their departure an era ends in Asendorf, after all the physicians practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we only had two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen remembers with a smile.
She already felt a little melancholy after the long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many more patients," says the internist.
Her husband added laughing, "We have a 6000 square meters of land."
"So far I have always shirked gardening, now it could be different".
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now border controls are also being ramped up at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl in Leitner.
At the same time, controls at the Hungarian border remain in place.
It was still clear that anyone who wanted to apply for asylum could do so "of course".
The care and security of the people are in the foreground.
It is also clear, however, that "clear signals are needed", said the Minister.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, not even across the Austrian border.
A controlled approach is needed.
Croatia considers "corridor" - Slovenia denied
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to allow incoming refugees to travel on to Austria and Germany and might also set up corridors for the refugees.
But interior minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana did not see it that way.
The idea of corridors was "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia would rather intensify the surveillance of the border, especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already strongly controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
However, as the Minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to close its borders for refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system will not work," stressed Györkös Znidar.
According to the Croatian government, the first refugees had already tried to enter eastern Croatia at the Tovarnik / Sid border crossing during the night hours on Tuesday in order to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby maize fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been arriving in the Croatian town of Tovarnik ever since.
They were mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are also already in action.
In the coming days, the Serbian Interior Minister, Ranko Ostojic, said that his country was expecting some 4,000 refugees.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted towards Croatia, reports Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade denied that it was instructing people to take certain routes: "We cannot and do not want to do this," it said.
According to media reports, a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the morning, and more buses were expected later in the day.
Via Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been travelling all night from the Macedonian border through Serbia, some 500 kilometres away.
"We heard that Hungary was closing down, so the police told us to come here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could actually lead to the shift of the previous Balkan route, which has already been predicted by observers, from Turkey to Greece and Macedonia to Serbia and Hungary to a slightly further western route.
Croatia: "Extensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia ’ s Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible emergency situations in the event of a large influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, had "comprehensive possibilities for border control".
Strict controls are in place to qualify for Schengen membership.
Slovenia has been a member of the EU since 2007 and the EU partners have consistently given Slovenia good marks in terms of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees remain behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they spent the past night at the Horgos border crossing, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings at Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic has tried to calm at a local inspection in Horgos on Wednesday morning, saying that the debate on alternative routes for refugees is premature after the Hungarian border is closed.
There would not be very high numbers of refugees at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey via Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee aid workers have already started to distribute maps to the refugees showing alternative routes through Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not without danger: 20 years after the end of the Croatian war, there are still not cleared minefields in parts of the border area.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of minesweepers had been sent to the border region.
Stock exchanges ’ hackers: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals accused of having repeatedly accessed unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
With the captured information insiders are said to have done business on the financial markets.
In this way, according to the investigators, a total of over 100 million dollars were raided.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately caught," the SEC said in a statement.
The trials against 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted both in the USA and from Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Aid Mannheim exists for 20 years
The Mannheim Paradeplatz is bustling with activity.
People do their errands, sometimes quick steps, sometimes leisurely strolling.
They head for the two stations of the Mannheim Motor Show at Paradeplatz.
trams.
Pulsating, blazing life in glorious autumn sunshine and in the midst of it four large tables each with the title "Before I die I want to"....
With this action, the Ecumenical Hospice Aid drew attention to its 20 years of existence and is confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The director of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid is available to passers-by for questions and discussions as well as the volunteers.
While some passers-by spontaneously reach for the chalk and add the words "yes to my life", "can read", "drive a camper through the USA", "stop the war" or "do not suffer for long", others stop for a moment, read, say sentences like "I have not yet reached that point" and then go on.
Again and again small discussions develop on the edge about the action itself, about life, about dealing with death.
Peter Huebinger is also on site.
"Only if I realize that the end of this world will come for me at some point can I live responsibly", says the director of the Diakonisches Werk Mannheim, which together with the Caritas Association is the carrier of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore this publicity effective action is good to the 20 The year.
It was understandable, however, that not everyone wanted to communicate publicly on the boards; after all, it was a very personal matter.
According to Josefine Lammer ’ s experience, the topic of death and death is still subject to taboos, although the hospice movement in particular has contributed a great deal to opening up people in recent years.
An assessment shared by Angelika Godefroid.
The dying and mourning companion belongs to the voluntary coworkers of the first hour.
Confronted with the topic through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid looked for volunteers by appeal, it immediately contacted them and was present at the foundation in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany those affected and their families in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and the Hospice Saint Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid knows how to handle her task and the experiences she has made.
"I see life from another point of view, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and non-denominational.
The financial support of health insurance funds and donations from relatives and associations enables the training as well as further training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The tablets described on Saturday are now on display in the house of the Protestant Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Also there further personal desires can be noted down on postcards.
FedEx ’ s earnings mixed, financial outlook for 2016 lowered
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the shipping giant lowered its profit outlook for an entire year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The share fell about 2.5 percent in the premarket, trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it will earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year that ends next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84 according to a survey by FactSet.
The lower prospect comes despite the price increases, which average 4.9 percent and will take effect on 4 January, and despite higher surcharges for ground transport of heavy and large parcels, which will be collected from November onwards.
The company said it still expects earnings to increase year-on-year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "yields solid returns, taking into account the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
Holiday employment plans were announced a day later than those of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent year-on-year.
Earnings per share were $2.42 per share, just short of $2.44 per share, which was predicted by twelve analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenues rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has caused sales to stagnate in its Express Shipping unit.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales of ground transportation increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
In the premarket, about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At its most anticipated meeting this year, Federal Reserve strategists will spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras mahogany table to decide whether it is time to raise the federal funds rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Threatening above them at one end of the decorated, two-story courtroom is a mural of the United States.
The card is a reminder that the Fed ’ s chairman, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues should put the nation ’ s economic interests ahead of all else.
The central bank has a double mandate from Congress: maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable here.
But, since the Great Recession, the Fed ’ s leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be weaned off the unprecedented incentive by the near-zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.
While most economic data show that it is growing solidly, recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives anxious to amplify this volatility by raising the federal bond rate, even if only by a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a pretext to not raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself is unsettling the financial market.
About half of the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted an interest-rate hike this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to wait and see, with a key indicator that indicates only a 30% chance of an increase.
This suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate, unless strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another increase is far off.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed will maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed were to raise rates at this point, "he said.
If it does, "it would have to go very far in its statement to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argued that an interest-rate hike would calm financial markets, because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed well on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that she expected the rate to increase this year, despite Liberal complaints that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labor market this year was solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and close to what the Fed considers full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And, while inflation has been consistently below the central bank ’ s 2% annual target, the Fed ’ s representatives have said that the main reason is the temporary impact of much lower oil prices.
The economy “can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of labour market tensions, ” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world flinched at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell more than 16% below its peak in May, when investors feared that a slowdown in China ’ s economy would slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below its May high.
For the Fed, market turbulence affects the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks had not occurred, they would be tightening the reins at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the impact.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data to describe the developments in China, ” Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed ’ s main concerns, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But, in the end, the Fed has become the world ’ s monetary authority.
The influence of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication in 2013 by then-head Ben S. Bernanke that the Fed could “narrow ” its monetary expansion caused confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, the Fed can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global wealth management strategy for Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of financial market over-reaction, which seems to be linked to movements not related to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee advocating an increase in interest rates, cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions “despite limited discernible effects on US growth, ” Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed ’ s representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put financial stability first only during a severe crisis like the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England ’ s interest-setting committee.
The recent turbulence is not coming close to this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into a situation where she is afraid of an interest rate increase because the markets get upset," said Poznan, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think it should run ahead of time.

Hoyerswerda: Small help for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
To give them a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers.
In Hoyerswerda, too, there are a number of people who selflessly support asylum seekers in the city.
Among them are Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with heart and soul.
Even with her 74 Lenzen she still likes to teach.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum seeker's home at Dillinger Straße.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is not the case at a real school.
Brazil ’ s Rio Grande Paediatric Society Promotes Nutrition for Healthy Breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is shocking in its efforts to educate women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by presenting pictures of babies sucking breasts painted with images of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine, Texas, showed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects their babies ’ genes and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernried sports hall
The municipal council of Bernried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flatter for solar plant.
The plans for the long-awaited construction of the gymnasium on the Bernried sports grounds are progressing step by step: in the most recent municipal council meeting, the drafted building application was unanimously approved without much discussion.
Before that, the committee had among other things decided on an application for an "exception" or "exemption" from the valid development plan.
The "exception" was about the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction.
Therefore a "gable roof with not central ridge and overhang" is to be erected.
Background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar plants: “Thereby we get a wonderfully large south roof together ”, explained mayor Josef Steigenberger in the meeting.
With the "liberation" it concerned again the roof inclination, which should lie for energetic reasons - differently than in the development plan prescribed - under ten degrees.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "liberation" became necessary, because the development plan permits no "exceptions" with regard to the roof pitch - whereby the Bernrieder local council proceeds as a rule with liberation requests rather restrictively.
However, the construction of the gymnasium is not a recurring project: "We are not setting a precedent", says Steigenberger.
The sports hall construction at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
At costs approximately 2.3 million euro are factored in.
Grants are expected from schools and grassroots sports funding.
In the next procedural step the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large resounds is submitted now to the district administration office for examination.
Peißenberg Clinic moves to Schongau
The hospital in Peißenberg is to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes the new Medical Director at Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of the staff move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is provided for by the surprising plans of the County Hospital Ltd., confirmed by District Administrator Andrea Jochner.
However, the Supervisory Board will make a decision on this and will meet next Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were to be implemented, all of the almost 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in Peißenberg.
The vast majority should move to Schongau with Fischer and the further existing Inner Station.
The rooms are available.
The coworkers, who cannot also to Schongau to be able, are to be offered a job in Weilheim, so Jochner wrongly white.
The employees were informed about the plans.
The change was triggered by the dismissal of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the Medical Director of the Schongauer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
With the question, which is to begin the follow-up, came according to Jochner white, the name “Fischer ” into the play, which agreed to take over starting from 1 October the line and to change with its team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau this means in each case an "appreciation" and a broadening of the offer in the range "internal medicine", so Jochner white.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialised in gastroenterological diseases.
If the supervisory board agrees, Fischer and his team will manage both houses for the next two years, until next year, when the former hospital of the Knappschaft, which still has 35 beds, is finally closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the county had planned this for 2018, when the current rehabilitation at the hospital Weilheim is completed.
Regional councillor Jochner Weiss, who is also chairman of the supervisory board, countered rumours that the house, which is owned by the Federal Shortage, will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers.
“I exclude that. ” Jochner“ Weiss ” could not say how the property would continue, there were several considerations.
Currently there is a short-term care of Caritas and a daily psychiatry.
"What could not have happened better to us, such an opportunity does not come back", said Fischer about the quasi relocation to the Lech, which was received "positively and very sympathetically" by the employees.
There was no real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as chief physician for over 30 years.
He had been asked by Schongau colleagues to take over the post of medical director.
The hospital in Peißenberg (once 100 beds) has been threatened with closure again and again in recent decades, and departments have been closed, for example surgery and obstetrics.
The handball players of the Rhine River Neckar Lions are challenged tonight (20.15) at the Bergisch HC.
The league leader is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason to be arrogant.
In the past season, the Baden team had a painful defeat at the BHC and have to make up for something there.
Hunting accident with two injured in Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured by shots during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the withdrawal on a corn field with Pratau (district Wittenberg) several hunters were in the employment, as the police communicated.
After one shot, a 63 and 22 year-old man sustained serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.

Missing 16 Years old Rhineland Palatinate Victims of Violent Crimes
A suspect has led the police to the body of the missing since Saturday 16 Years old from Rhineland Palatinate.
During interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted that he had killed the youths and thrown her body into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A missing since Saturday 16 Years old from Rhineland-Palatinate has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, as announced by the prosecution and the police on Wednesday.
Also suspected of the crime on Tuesday evening was a 20-year-old man who confessed to the crime and led the investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old was reported missing on Sunday morning, after she had come home the night before after a visit to an autumn festival in Rockenhausen not as agreed.
In their search for the young woman, the investigators first came across the victim ’ s personal belongings.
Surveys in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing persons finally revealed a suspicion of crime against the 20-year-old.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the authorities, the detainee admitted during the police interrogation that the 16-year-old had been killed and that the body had been placed in the sewer.
The 20-year-old should be brought before the judge on Wednesday, the investigators charge him with manslaughter.
The investigation is intended to shed light on the circumstances of the crime.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also looking for affordable accommodation.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are entering a market that is already overloaded in many big cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the association "Sozialer Wohnungsbau".
For comparison: 260,000 units will be ready in Germany this year.
This means that 140,000 homes are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in initial accommodation.
Many then hit the housing market and join the long queues in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees.
The study also identifies significant shortcomings in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is pushing ahead with a housing deficit that is growing from year to year.
Currently, around 770,000 residential units were missing in the conurbations, laments Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many working people therefore had to live in large cities in shared flats.
Young adults involuntarily stayed longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the slump on the housing market.
In the big cities, the number of square metres per capita has fallen again for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Social Housing Alliance proposes a new start.
New incentives are to stimulate social housing.
The land transfer tax could be waived and the property tax for subsidised housing temporarily suspended.
In addition, attractive tax depreciation options are necessary according to the Alliance.
The KfW state bank ’ s support programme for refugee accommodation is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the launch, more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available had already been called up on Monday evening at 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be extended.
Refugees have free passage: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
There is practically no way through to Hungary, with more and more refugees choosing the route via Croatia.
Zagreb announces to allow the passage through Slovenia to the north without hurdles.
But the route is still dangerous.
Croatia intends to reach agreement with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a refugee corridor.
"I spoke to the Slovenian Minister of Interior and if necessary we will organize a corridor," said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian / Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have left for Croatia in order to reach Western Europe.
500 people have crossed the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV station RTL.
Hungary had closed its border for refugees the day before.
Moreover, new laws that entered into force on the same day make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary practically superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "They can pass through and we are preparing for this possibility."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who live and want to achieve something.
However, they are people who do not want to live in Croatia.
In the morning, the Croatian police picked up the first refugees at Serbia ’ s border with Croatia, a neighbouring country of the EU.
According to media reports, most of them came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came to the Serbian border town of Sid by both bus and taxi.
Immediately after their arrival, they had tried to cross the green border to Croatia on foot.
The refugees do not encounter border fences at the Croatian Serbian border.
But the border strip poses other dangers: sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s are still lying there.
Mine clearers should now quickly create a safe passage.
However, there are hardly any refugees coming to Hungary after the closing of the border.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people apprehended.
Shortly before closing on Monday, it had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify the overcoming and damaging of the border fence as a criminal offence.
Therefore, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
Those sentenced face prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, of which almost all - 93 - were at the most important crossing Röszke.
The applicants include 13 families with young children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees there.
In practice, however, no one has any prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary.
In Hungary's view, Serbia is a 'safe third country'.
The rejected asylum seekers will be deported there.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the "transit zone" in Röszke.
In Röszke started to clean up workers.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.
Barriers were dismantled and one of the reception centres in the border town was rebuilt.
Nobody wanted to comment on the aim of this reconstruction.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, only a few refugees reach Austria.
The country has also strengthened border controls.
According to the government, around 20,000 migrants were still in the country.
In Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the onward journey to Germany.
Train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the orders of the German authorities.
Smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot in Freilassing.
Mayor drove "stranded" across the border
"After the bridge party on Sunday we were busy cleaning up, when suddenly ten people with suitcases were standing at the entrance of the tent", says Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
However, because Germany had surprisingly stopped the train traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flood of refugees, it was the end for them in Wernstein ", said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and chauffeured the stranded people together with two other helpers and their cars across the border to near Passau.
Before that, we fed the unexpected guests with snacks and drinks.
We said straight away, we bring them by car to Passau.
"That was a matter of course for us", said Stadler in the OÖN.
They were very grateful.
One man did not want to miss out on handing over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
"We were very pleased with that," said Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had changed from an ICE train to a regional train in the direction of Passau on Sunday evening in Wels, in order to try to cross the border after the announcement that the train traffic to Germany had been stopped at short notice.
The regional train was parked before the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, cross-border travel is generally very popular.
The Bridge Festival was a social event with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, the day before it was a sporting two-bridge race - organised by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
That Viktor Orbán is now sending us tens of thousands more is a logical result of hypocritical politics:
Instead of immediately helping to set up structures in the Röszke camp that guarantee humanity, our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly placed the attitude of the Hungarian government in the milieu of National Socialism.
The victims of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now faced with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to realize that the "promised land", which invited and welcomed them, is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, in view of the continuing refugee flows and the approaching winter, to create humane conditions for those seeking protection in our country.
And it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winterized accommodations
Konrad has his hands full with refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word carries weight.
The government has used the powerful former Raiffeisen banker to build quarters for the thousands of refugees.
Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos in the initial reception centre in Traiskirchen.
"We have no more homeless people in Traiskirchen", he reported about his first success.
The 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday were also accommodated without much ado, said Konrad, praising the organisational "masterpiece".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation".
Konrad expects a total demand of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to fulfil the figure, 35,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 to be provided by the federal states, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can make it.
“But it ’ s not a bottomless pit, ” Konrad said.
He has already held talks with the Landeshauptleuten.
They had assured him that they would also create quarters for the coming refugees.
"Things are going well in Upper Austria," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP of Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to clarify how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also has great expectations of the ORF ’ s “Help like us ” campaign.
Private individuals can easily offer accommodation on the platform.
In addition, one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter.
Yesterday Konrad and Maier criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of need it could not be that accommodation providers have to adhere to a certain height of the towel rails or the size of the skylights.
For a limited period, "emergency standards" should apply.
Konrad explains with his experience that, unlike the Interior Ministry, he is more successful in housing.
I am an elderly gentleman who is not easily told the untruth.
His main weapon is persuasion.
Konrad and Maier do not cost the Republic, as they themselves explained.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
The search for accommodation has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there seem to be problems with the permit.
Linz Calls for Better Distribution
For the time being, the city of Linz is not planning an opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as Tips ’ Arena and the Design Center for housing refugees.
This is currently not necessary, as the affected can currently be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, other sites will be tested for their suitability in the event of an emergency.
The city chief criticizes the distribution of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts must also make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Borders are not sealed off"
In a long telephone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) on Monday, Landeshauptmann Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on the way forward on the refugee issue.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off.
The onward journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
There will be no special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being.
The protection seekers would be brought however with regular trains to Germany.
From the other EU member states, Pühringer once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue.
For Pühringer, the fact that Austria is now also reintroducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" of the actions of the Germans.
The Next Runtastic Is a Matter of Time
The general refurbishment of the "Neue Werft" in the Linzer Industriezeile is officially completed.
The publicly listed IT company S & T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and production building, with the remainder (2,700 square metres) being leased to young, innovative companies in the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to make them work for us," says S & T Group CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Shipyard and later to acquire some.
Right from the start, S & T wants to cooperate with its new neighbours, of which Niederhauser has high hopes: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time."
S & T invested 1.7 million euros in the location, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which is owned by one third each of the city of Linz, the Province of Upper Austria and the Federal Government (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG to S & T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30 percent of the remaining 2700 square meters in the building have already been let, and there are inquiries for a further 40 percent.
Lia ’ Peroni ’ owner opened second shop in the arcade
In the new shop, the focus is on Furla ’ s handbags.
Actually Jutta Breit wanted to buy herself a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the Pigeon Market, Arkade, had to postpone this project without further ado: After all, she has now grown in the form of another local store.
In the Furla ’ Shop across the street from the shop, where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothes from various manufacturers, everything revolves around ladies ’ handbags of the brand Furla, wallets are available from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday the new shop is in operation.
Previously, several weeks were rebuilt.
"But I thought long and hard about whether I should still open a shop," says Breit.
Decisive for the decision was, among other things, that the Furla-producers, who are at home in Bologna, were taken with the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
“We are the only ones in the Linz metropolitan area who sell this brand, ” says the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots.
Her mother laid her fashion in the cradle.
It suits me best when something is developing and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so some woman with the sight of a beautiful handbag comes into rapture, the specialist woman cannot answer also with last certainty.
Perhaps it is because a beautiful bag upgrades every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatinate ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called show-offs.
Some people also associate this characteristic with the billionaire who wants to become US President.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for exciters.
Whether he is xenophobic, rude to journalists, or reveals gaps in international crisis-management knowledge, the US presidential candidate is making a big splash.
And it does well.
This is also recorded in the Palatine town of Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the hairstyle is known to many in the winegrowers' village on the Wine Road.
Some of the 1200 inhabitants in the place is about -zig corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
Simone Wendel from Kallstadt made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find it somehow exciting, but are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadt way," says Simone Wendel.
Born in Kallstadt, she has made an amusing documentary about the town and its famous offspring, which includes Trump and the Heinz ketchup family.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also has his say in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014), saying that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not get to the King of Hearts there.
While there is respect for the family ’ s performance, there is also a tendency to believe that Trump is “a bit of a bigmouth, ” says Wendel.
Coincidentally, the nickname that Kallstadt has in its vicinity is "Die Brulljesmacher" (The Brulljesmakers) - in High German: the show-off, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of boobies.
Trump ’ s success story began in 1885, when his future grandfather emigrated and opened a restaurant for gold diggers in the United States.
The foundation stone of the real estate group was the first purchase of land in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy: Their desire to return permanently to their homeland failed because of the Bavarian state to which the Palatinate belonged at that time.
The director of the Institute for Palatine History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared that he had not accepted Trump because he had once run away without permission.
Trump is the grandson of an “illegal immigrant. ”
This is in contrast to the sometimes pithy statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly disparaged Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
“As he rumbles, it ’ s not so likeable, ” says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ’ s (“ Grandma was a born Trump, Grandpa was born Heinz ”).
The retired winemaker sees the American rather distanced, "he is always so effervescent".
Does he think Trump will come?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never cared about Kallstadt".
The innkeeper Veronika Schramm mentions, like many people in Kallstadt, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine Donald's," says the 68-year-old.
It would be better if he didn't win the election, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good."
If those who were in charge in the USA at the time of his grandfather had been like him, "he would never have arrived there".
"There are more interesting topics than him", says winemaker's daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
"It's not my president," she says.
And: "The grapes ripen even without President Trump".
Wendel ’ s film, for which Trump was long interviewed, has seen 12,000 moviegoers, and interest is also arousing in the US.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountaineering village".
On Wednesday, the 1800 inhabitants of the village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for sustainable tourism from the vice president of the German Alpine Club, Ludwig Wucherpfennig.
In Austria there are already 20 "mountaineering villages".
In the neighbouring country, the local Alpine Club is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountaineering village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise Dominates Reviews, Despite Nine's Attempts to Take the Loss of Leadership at Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report following the loss of liberal leadership, but there has been no big shift in ratings for Today.
Nine ’ s breakfast show was broadcast from the capital when Malcolm Turnbull toppled Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with presenters David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a week-long series of international television programs, which also included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of distance didn ’ t seem to matter to Australian viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to today ’ s 339,000.
Today posted a slight increase over the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number fell short of last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to the 330,000 from Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year the gap ran between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise stands with an average of 349,000 spectators to 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for checking!

The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could carry a hit show solo without the rafter star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result answered with a resounding 'yes'.
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and easily beat The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results in evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (5: 00 pm to 5: 30 pm) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, yielded an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (5: 30 pm to 6: 00 pm) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire`s Hot Zehn Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia scored 520,000 spectators and in the second half hour a whopping 720,000.
Hot ’ Seat Average 620,000.
The drop in the odds on the second night of The Chase Australia will give Nine confidence that Hot ’ s Seat will finally prevail at 17: 30.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that couldn ’ t get past the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret Revealed?...
Lana Jeavon ’ s ， Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly apparently who wins The Bachelor ’ s.
The woman Sam Wood ends up with in The Bachelor has been shrouded in secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski, and Lana Jeavons, Fellows, the day before three become two, you may have accidentally given an indication of who the winner will be.
Sam Wood holds his lips tightly sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women have lyrically expressed why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humour, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons for wanting to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If not you, who should get Woods last rose?", their answers could become the spoilsport of who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavon ’ s “Fellows ” and Markoski quickly named Mackay – except themselves – as Wood ’ s best partner.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from day one.
"From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarah's) and Sam's energies, I felt that they were pretty compatible, and I thought that throughout the whole show," Jeavor's fellow students said.
"Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet, it's so much fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry.
You feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that the house visit last week made it clear to her that Wood could be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was obviously not just a game - I am now fully attuned to him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should vote for, if not her, she was puzzling.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the leftover girls equally - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday, 19: 30.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL Football career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the US - and there were many other teams that sent in inquiries after his impressive open practice day late last year.
But Hayne picked the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have relegated Hayne to the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a tussle just as the Aussie ’ s Rugby ’ s league did when convert on his first Punt ’ s return on Tuesday at the 20 + 3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a punt ’ Return and also into the ongoing game after an injury from Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne publicly in his press conference after the match.
The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his battered catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patches a punt restored in the first quarter by the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian entourage had been hoping for for his NFL-debut.
Hayne left the field cursing after the fumble and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start into his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the carver to his Origin debut back in 2007, when a pass at his own in his own goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was still a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans, holding an Australian flag after the game and posting it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested by force of arms on a Siberian runway.
Having openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his Yukos oil company confiscated, and his democratic efforts stopped.
The Free Voters demand the employment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees.
Party and group leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the University of Bavaria Herbstklausur in Großwallstadt of a severe crisis at Bavarian schools, if there are not correspondingly new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers, to save the schools from collapse", Aiwanger said.
"Otherwise we will get distortions in the Bavarian education system."
The parliamentary group of Free Voters meets until Friday in the Lower Franconian Commune.
In fact, quite different main themes were envisaged.
But the record number of refugees is now also dominated by the Free Voters ’ meeting.
"Of course, the subject of asylum will overshadow the enclosure," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as was the case during the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s.
“So it doesn ’ t go on, we have to address the causes, ” said the Free Voters ’ head.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport the Free Voters as soon as possible.
Aiwanger therefore also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum applications: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," Aiwanger said.
The FW ’ s chief criticized that several federal states were not consistent: “We need uniform standards of the federal states nationwide. ”
"Bavaria departs, others not."
"We need to be more able to act."
But the state policy in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-standing favourite remains on the agenda: education policy.
At the beginning of the new school year, Minister of Education and Cultural Affairs Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot experiment "Mittelstufe plus" (middle school plus) at 47 grammar schools, in which an extension of the secondary school stage from three to four years is tested.
But this does not go far enough for Aiwanger.
"The topic G9 must be accelerated", said the FW.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools who want it.
Free access to the G9 wherever you want.

4 people killed after police officers shoot rubber bullets at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, some 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, senior district official, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, some of them throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, known to kill but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The dispute was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal ’ s southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal by the Tharus ethnic group, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been involved in violent clashes since the 10th
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week, legislators voted on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The site at the Alte Post Youth Centre in Emden is to be redeveloped.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of 4000 square meters.
A mixture from trade, trade and living is planned - there are however not yet concrete offers.
Emden - The city of Emden intends to market a 4,000 square metre property in the immediate vicinity of the Alte Post Youth Centre.
Preparations for this are under way.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade, commerce and housing.
One waits for appropriate offers, it says on the part of the city.
It is not yet clear which investor would be eligible.
Accordingly, no contracts had yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought a part of the property, which is located at the Ringstrasse / Große Strasse corner, a few months ago and had the building located on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The planning for the cottage settlement at the Little Sea near Emden is taking shape.
The investor presented plans for the project to the public for the first time.
Many residents are still worried - they fear the sellout of their leisure resort
For months they had been negotiating, brooding, debating and drawing behind closed doors.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement at the Little Sea near Emden are on the table.
The prospective customer, the medium-sized Emden company "System-Construction", presented its plans publicly for the first time on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Emder Council.
This item was originally on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP parliamentary group, which accused the investor and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends of the system "Bau" management went on the offensive: "We do not yet have an answer to all questions," he said to the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it was good to be able to meet all rumors now.
The project, costing around ten to twelve million euros, has been under discussion for months.
The pictures and new details of the desired hotel building provoked violent reactions among the seafront owners who had come to the meeting.
Roberto Schulz, owner of a seafront booth and board member of the local residents' interest group, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a huge block that towers above all other buildings."
Furthermore, like many other project critics, he fears that the traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant: "Whole bus loads must come so that it pays off," says Schulz.
However, what exactly happens on the one-hectare area of the former restaurant is still open.
There is still no operator.
"First we have to have a coherent concept", said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the development plans were still variable.
Twin offspring of gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is happy about offspring of its gorillas.
Yesterday, 26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo dates back almost 50 years and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the zoo.
The sex of the newborn gorilla, twins, is not yet fixed, as mother Dian keeps her tight to the body.
First the "Bild" had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde
The U.S. National Hurricane Center announced on Tuesday a wide low pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60 percent chance to develop into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined rotogravure system in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60% potential to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google Launches Doubling Donations to Raise $11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL. O) announced a doubling fundraising campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has taken an unusually personal approach in announcing the donate-calling on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But, as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people, including my family, are desperately seeking help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Médecins Sans Frontières, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first globally collected donations to a value of 5.5 million on google.com / refugeerelief will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabetics.
According to a new study, the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years.
It is still too early to say whether slightly obese people with diabetes will live longer after weight loss surgery than those who do not receive surgical treatments.
"The mortality data take a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss, who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight inducing loss, operations or obesity, surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body ’ s ability to eat.
Over the years, operations to treat type 2 diabetes have proven to be effective, but most studies have been conducted in people who are morbidly obese with a body parameter index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain level of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan ’ s Min ’ s Sheng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity – gastric bypass and gastric tubing – to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent this operation dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained roughly the same in those who did not receive surgical diabetes treatments.
Among those who underwent surgical intervention, 36% of those with diabetes dissolved completely and 28% partially.
In the medically treated group, diabetes was resolved completely in only one percent and partially in only about two percent.
In addition, the results in the controls of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL, cholesterol "were generally better in the" surgical "group, the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient ’ s blood level of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to senior researcher Dr. Chih, Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In its fifth year, the bypass surgical group had lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg) compared to the gastro-rectomy group, achieved greater declines in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and recorded more of a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit from surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people undergoing obesity surgery were about 29% less likely to die over the course of 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show any benefit for survival in surgery, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group," without an increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we are waiting too long for people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult. "

"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT ￣ News
Europe cannot take in all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the refugees ’ home countries.
The Dalai Lama raised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK in his speech at the inauguration of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that, in the given circumstances, the interests of humanity should take precedence over the interests of individual nations, or even continents.
He also stressed that Western European countries ’ response to the refugee crisis, while admirable, was not appropriate to the situation.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe", he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria ’ s efforts to overcome the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Caring for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions on how to create real peace and development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama raised the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9 / 11 terrorist attack and pointed out that the violent reaction of the US led to a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and I told him that the way to solve this problem is through non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has led to unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the intake of hand disinfectants by children in the last four years
Poison control centers in the United States report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow heavily alcoholic hand disinfectants, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand disinfectant revenues in children under 12 years of age reporting poison control centers have increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children come more and more frequently to these products, and unfortunately ends up a percentage of them go to the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a dare test on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants just because of a cheap experience.
Teenagers have reportedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by the attractive scents of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand ， disinfectant) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange scents, which are very appealing to children.
Hand disinfectants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in infants, a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Poison Control Center at the University of Kansas Hospital, Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you would not let a sip of whisky stand around, but people leave this hand, disinfectant within reach of children, and if children get it, then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four splashes of strawberry-scented hand disinfectant at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Their blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room physician who treated them at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah uttered her words and was unable to leave when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children ’ s hospital for signs of brain trauma as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use alcohol-free products or disinfectant wipes and store hand disinfectants out of the child ’ s reach.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand sanitizers containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in New York State planned to poison their "mean" teacher by displaying antibacterial products around the classroom, "a police report reported.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banished her from her room.
The police regarded the foiled plan as "chatter" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authorities.

Lack of championship competition in Scottish football bores Dutchman - de Boer
Former Rangers midfield player and former international of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football team fans have lost interest in Celtic, because there is no title indicating rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they show no more highlights of the Celtic, and why?"
It ’ s because the Rangers aren ’ t there.
People here aren ’ t just talking about the Rangers ’ return.
They talk about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that ’ s what interests them.

We feel the same - but we must go further.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Standing together now is so important.

Players who come in the summer will have time this preseason, to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.

Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while rising in the UK as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed people in the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland ’ s 5.9% unemployment rate was higher than the UK ’ s 5.5%, according to figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with employment now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0% over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5%.
Commenting on the latest figures, Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland took the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a fall in unemployment.

Why I'll Witness an Execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch as a man is put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn ’ t, I will sit in a viewer ’ s gallery in the Death Chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was issued for the first time in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I began to fear.
So why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States, and because there are often more applications than places, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media outlets from 12 to five.
Those who are selected will observe it without emotion.
I cannot.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip ’ s closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months of phone calls and a two-and-a-half hour visit.
I like that guy.
We often laugh a lot when we speak.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the story of the detainee as he wants it, and you get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have formulated it better", but she still thinks that what I am doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write.
When he dies, he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I have made.
I do not want to go back over all the details here.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the assassination of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the crime.
But I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective I will see him die.
I cannot claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can turn.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man persuaded to come out of the Canning River after police chase
The Canning Vale policeman stayed dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and swampy water, just a few yards from a police officer who was trying to "gently persuade him to return to the shore."
Police from Canning Vale were called to a trespass incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape in the direction of the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I can't get out, come and get me', said senior sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about wetting his uniform, so he used a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiates".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said senior sergeant Castledine.
Football champion Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, cousins drove his car into the trench to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to humorously plan a Ben Cousin ’ s biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that stewards tried to spy on him and threaten to end racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted the stewards and integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they were conducting a personal campaign against him with late scratching by Lady Tatai for a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he ’ d always tried to do what ’ s best for racing and found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt in Lidaris, which he can ’ t explain.
He had held back 18 months for espionage and did not want it "to look like too high hanging grapes."
"I didn't intend to say anything about it, and I sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you are so frustrated that it all comes out all at once," Moody said.
You know that it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around with my head held high, and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.
If they start thinking that I don ’ t, then I shouldn ’ t be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what to do with my license.
Previously, Moody had let the bomb go in an interview with racing.com that the Integrity Department had tried to spy on his barn.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name if asked - and offered him employment in my stables to provide information about what I am doing inside my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
They seem to believe that I am a cheat.
If that is the case, I am sure they should grab at their noses because they failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and still are today.
Should this lead me to believe that it will be personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardly and maybe blames people outside of coaches for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think that I am.
Perhaps they will have to take my license and disown me, and I have no doubt that what I am saying makes them think about it now.
But I have now reached the point where I don ’ t care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach ’ s frustration levels have been built up with the long-term cobalt testing at Lidari, and the late scratching resulted in him saying he could “throw his license over the table. ”
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeaten champion Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse's legs, which violated the rules.
“It ’ s against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this, "he said.
"One of my staff mistakenly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like that all day yesterday, as it was.
But it was the same on race day.
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day. An investigation of this matter was opened.
It is a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all recognise that we need rules, but here we have gone too far," Moody said.
Man Arrested after Driver Ride
At the weekend, the police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist and a subsequent driver-escape in Cobram.
The cyclist was brought to the Royal Melbourne Hospital by helicopter with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the motorist drove on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with driving abuse, failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram remains in hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne / Storm / Coach Craig Bellamy Strikes Back Against Rival for Claims on Wrestling Fights
Melbourne ’ s Storm ’ s head coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his players ’ tackling the “agenda ” setting of two of the NRL ’ s Premier League favorites.
Sydney Rooster ’ s coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm ’ s players to “wrestle ” with his team during the high Storm ’ s victory in the Qualifying Final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled comment on the Storm ’ s team after his team won the final against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a “prime example ” of the Rugby League and said the two from Queensland were not“ too good ” at wrestling.
Bellamy defended the tacklimg of his team and said that they only focused on their "contact" when doing tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team gave him confidence, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm ’ s team.
"That keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact at Tackles a real focus, and that has brought about a turnaround for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train for. He ’ s probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It is funny how this always occurs at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his Saturday night game with ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was, ” Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said that he would take care of a shit.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants to play all of his kind of football – not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like this.
I build greater confidence because they say these things, because they are a little concerned about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn ’ t think about us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roosters scored a higher score than the game Broncos vs. Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12?
Our game was 20: 18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are pauses and no points something exciting?
For me, it is the schedules.
When they mention us, it means that we will still meet them at one stage.
Storm ’ s team is off this weekend as they have won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night in the pre-final at AAMI Park. Ticket sales will start next Tuesday morning.
Serbian with 200,000 $bail after drug charge
A man who may face a life sentence for attempting to acquire 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and landed in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was watched as he met his co-defendants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic ’ s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to possess the entire quantity and that there might have been a harmless reason for being in the café.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned about the danger of Maksimovic fleeing.
It has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic ’ s mother and stepfather had jointly offered a $200,000 bail as security to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of the two, it is clear that imposing a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, under the conditions that he surrenders his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police daily and complies with a curfew of 18: 00, 06: 00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: cab is torn apart
In a rear-end collision with three trucks on the Autobahn 5 near Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to move to the left at the last moment, as the police announced.
The cab of the person causing the accident broke completely apart.
The driver was taken to hospital with serious injuries.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe, North was over six hours to 2 Clock completely closed.
The damage amounted to 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used phone from girls to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl ’ s phone when she was asleep, logged into an online “messaging ” service, from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the sleeping Hogg ’ s hand.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers found at the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used terms to search for indecent pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done so because it would lead to "pedophiles on the Internet" and he then "pretended to be a policeman to scare them."
The prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: “He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said that he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in his head when he was drinking and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added, "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computers and PlayStation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charges of taking indecent pictures of children on 14 June last year, violating the conditions on 25 January this year, and not appearing in court at a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, arguing that "no significant sexual element" was to be found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was added to the list of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Traffickers divert to small border crossings with Germany
More and more refugees are being picked up off the major checkpoints at the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers increasingly left people at smaller border crossings for fear of discovery and arrest
on the Austrian side, said a spokesman for the Federal Police.
Along the border river Inn, more than 1000 refugees have been intercepted since Tuesday in the counties of Passau and Rottal.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and weirs.
There they are received by federal policemen and forwarded for registration.
According to Federal Police data, significantly more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station than at the beginning of the week on Wednesday.
Around 700 people had arrived in the state capital by 8 a.m. alone, a spokesman said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls at the German border in Austria, 1759 refugees reached the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: Foothills of tropical storm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of squalls in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area over Western Europe, warm sea air currently flows into the country, announced the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart.
The strong low is the offshoot of tropical storm "Henry", which has moved in recent days from the Bermuda Islands across the Atlantic.
Violent storms and thunderstorms are expected, especially in Baden.
According to DWD, gusts of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour can be expected until Thursday morning in the Black Forest, the Swabian Alb and the Lake Constance region.
On Friday the sun can be seen longer.
The masses do it: every two years the automakers show their new products at the IAA.
In 2015, the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well, are particularly moving.
Cars in the compact class are currently in particular demand: According to the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA), around 28.1 percent of new registrations were in this segment in August alone.
This is also reflected at the IAA (public days from 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept cars and new luxury and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at dealerships in the autumn.
“The Astra is an extremely important model for us, ” said Opel / Vauxhall CEO Karl Josef Neumann at the show.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
To ensure that the high-volume model also sells well, the new Astra is not expected to become much more expensive.
Opel offers the prospect of an entry below its largest competitor, the VW Golf, which starts at 17,650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16,990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp.
In addition, Hesse offers further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / 200 hp, which for the first time also includes three-cylinder gasoline engines.
Unlike its main competitors, the VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-door model.
The station wagon, which can already be seen at the IAA, will follow as the second variant in the spring.
And in addition to the Astra, what other new compact cars will be shown at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault has entered the fourth generation of its Astra rival Mégane.
At the show, the Mégane will be presented exclusively as a five-door version in a conventional and a decidedly sporty GT.
It will be on sale at the beginning of next year, then also as a station wagon.
Infiniti: Brand new in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
With the new model, Nissan ’ s new offshoot wants to find its position in the fast-growing segment.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the design line of the brand.
The basic model will be equipped with a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp.
A diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp is also available.
Suzuki Baleno: Another new addition to the segment is the Suzuki Baleno, which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with gasoline engines, including a newly developed 1.0 liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp.
According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 Newton metres (Nm).
The Baleno will be launched in Europe in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
On the exterior, the designers of the high-end Citroën buck mainly applied a hand to the front end: the radiator grille was redesigned and the modified headlamps were equipped with LED technology.
Above all, the infotainment system in the interior was modernised, the number of buttons was reduced by a touchscreen and Apple ’ s CarPlay was integrated for the first time.
At the IAA, there will also be a series of revisions in the compact class and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class and the Peugeot 308 GTI.
Berlin jail Tegel: Five square meters of cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court ruled in favour of an ex-prisoner of the Tegel penitentiary who had been held for months in a cell that was too small.
Prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation for violating their human dignity if they are housed in cells that are too small.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, the persons concerned can hope for money even if they were only imprisoned for a few days in the confined spaces (Az.: 1 BvR 1127 / 14).
Thus, an ex-prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: He was in the correctional facility in Berlin, Tegel accommodated between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space; the toilet was spatially not separated.
After that, the man, who according to his lawyer is now at large again, was transferred to a larger cell.
His official liability action against the Land Berlin because of the unworthy prison conditions failed.
But the constitutional judges overturned the judgment of the Berlin Court of Appeal and remanded the case for reconsideration.
They see the human dignity of the man as being violated.
Court of Appeal now decides on amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days' imprisonment was decisive for the compensation of the period in question, there was a claim for compensation, it was said.
Otherwise, 'a deterioration of the legal protection of the personality' would be to be feared.
The Court of Appeal must now clarify the amount of the monetary compensation.
Constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
They only awarded damages to a detainee in April because he was locked up naked in a cell.
According to a decision in 2011, the multiple use of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy of humanity.
In addition, on Wednesday, Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court, which in a parallel case in November 2009 had certified a degrading accommodation for a prisoner.
The plaintiff at the time was placed in a cell of the same type as in the Karlsruhe case for three months, daily between 15 and 21 hours.
The Berlin prisons have also made headlines in recent weeks because of the lack of personnel.
Prisoners are therefore locked up again and again for 23 hours, the aggressiveness increases, even fights are said to have occurred because of the tense situation.
According to information from the Justice Press Office, 21 vacancies in Tegel are unfilled due to a lack of young talent, 19 of which are due to disappear in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We can do it"
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What is to come for Germany?
According to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, around 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year. According to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even in a position to take in one million refugees.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do it and we can do it."
The following overview gives an overview of what lies ahead for Germany.
According to different forecasts, between 350,000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400,000 (estimate of the Pestel institute) apartments will be used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as the current construction (250000 apartments).
However, the lack of housing is particularly dramatic in the case of affordable rental properties: every year 60,000 to 80,000 social housing units are excluded from the fixed rent, and refugees will also apply for these particularly cheap apartments.
Federal Minister of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
From the point of view of the Pestel institute, this is far too little: 80 000 social housing units would have to be built each year and the federal government would have to invest 6.4 billion per year in funding for this.
Scientists and the Federal Building Minister agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing.
The Institute for Employment Research estimates that 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany are not systematically asked about their qualifications in order to help them get started, criticises Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany.
According to migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt, work is the key to social contacts, to esteem in the host society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants.
According to Thränhardt, there has been a political change in Germany: from a working ban for refugees to the recognition of work.
Whereas in the past there was a working ban for asylum seekers of up to five years, in November 2014 this was reduced to three months, as was the Residenzpflicht, which restricted asylum seekers to one place of residence.
The majority of society - also due to the shortage of skilled labour - has accepted the view that refugees should be given faster access to the labour market.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German.
There is not yet a sufficient supply of general and professional language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often placed through personal contacts.
The structure of networks is therefore according to opinion of Thränhardt the king way to the work integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugee parents put their children in the day-care centers, an estimated ten to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it is first and foremost very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of the kindergarten, the administration distributes leaflets in various languages.
Should the demand for nursery school teachers rise sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the educational capacities - for example by allowing more technical schools.
In the countries, students without knowledge of German are prepared for lessons in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin School Administration.
The German Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.
As a matter of principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or those who have patience with them from studying - the only exception so far has been Berlin, but Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his position.
Access to higher education could be facilitated for refugees willing to study.
Refugees with a residence permit or toleration no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Seekers' Benefits Act when they begin their studies.
As a matter of principle, the latter do not receive any bafög, as they do not fall within the circle of persons entitled to bafög.
Until now, tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be entitled to Bafög. From 1 January 2016, this period will be reduced to 15 months.
Steffen Krach, Berlin ’ s State Secretary for Science, and the German Studentenwerk demand that this funding gap also be closed.
Students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should successively grant Islam the same rights as the churches have, and further develop the existing state - churches - right to a new state - religions.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare organization that would professionally care for the newcomers.
Rights also include duties.
So the representatives of Islam must agree on clear interlocutors and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant it certain possibilities of control.
This includes a willingness to take a courageous stand against religious fundamentalism.
The Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed his concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "have immediately forfeited their right to stay here, in Germany," he said on Bavarian radio.
He proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be an issue for the whole of society even more than it is today.
As a result, the majority society will also have to change, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
As a result of European decisions, Germany has had an anti-discrimination body and a General Equal Opportunities Act for almost a decade.
But it is slowly learning, as the NSU showed, murder series, in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have been calling for for a long time, and what international agreements such as the Anti-Racism Convention commit Germany to, must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens are to make use of its opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the refugees expected so far, according to the President of the Medical Association, Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"In terms of man power and capacity, we can do that," he told the Tagesspiegel.
However, additional money had to flow into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery requests to hand out health cards to all arrivals at the time of registration.
Services rendered could later be billed to the Länder.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to fobbish so many people with the limited list of benefits provided for in the Asylum Seekers' Benefits Act.
Apart from that, it is above all the language barriers that cause the doctors trouble.
The Berlin-based health scientist Thea Borde has already shown that migrants are less well informed about their illnesses than other patients.
Not only in clinics, also in physician practices would have to be taken over interpreter costs, demands it.
However, many refugees would already be helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there were significantly more untreated disabilities, and young people were concerned with HIV education.
However, Montgomery believes that German doctors can cope with the partly different clinical pictures from their training.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect," and as far as the shortage of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even bring relief.
Syrians have a sophisticated education system, and some refugees are even doctors.
In order to be allowed to practice, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take tests again.
The Federal Chamber of Psychotherapists (BPtK) estimates that at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill: most of them suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recently published study by the Technical University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children arrive in Germany traumatized.
Those suffering from a post-traumatic stress disorder suffer, among other things, from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe fright and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment was necessary, explained Munz.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social services, the treatment usually takes several months.
Furthermore, in the social welfare offices, it is usually specialists or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses who decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to miscalculations, says Munz.
Manege invites to dream
With the new staging "Passion", Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to captivate every age group with fascinating acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to dream in the arena on the brick washer.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family", says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior boss.
"Passion" - this is the motto of the current arena.
The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years.
The gift of enthusiasm is in the blood of the family.
“It is important to us to take the people away from their everyday routine and take them away for two hours into a completely different world ”, emphasizes the 27-year-old junior boss.
"Manege cocktail with cosmopolitan flair" is how director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities can now experience this flair on the almost 3,000 kilometre long tour.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also know their craft.
The Cuban duo wants to easily compete with the heroes of the silent films.
Lightness and agility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art at the mast is meant to take women ’ s hearts by storm.
Apart from numerous volleys of laughter, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with sensitivity and agility.
Balancing on a ball with a unicycle?
For He Yuan no problem.
Serpents fascinate and scare at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinates with its agility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family", emphasizes Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Circus animal malkeeping is all too often an issue for various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also comments: "If our animals are not doing well, we are not doing well either".
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every stroke.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, every wish is read from the eyes as far as possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel well, it also does not want to go into the ring.
The first commandment: take good care of the animals.
The Probst family is especially proud of their Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPony stallion and a Zebra mare.
The two animals lived together in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there", Brigitte Probst tells.
The zebroid is not yet ready for the arena, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So there should be something for every visitor.
"One thing is for sure", says Stephanie Probst: "Whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always give our best and are there with all our heart".
The Circus Probst invites you to its performances from 17 to 20 September every day at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday is family day, for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced.
The animal show is also open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe ’ s Robert Mugabe gives false speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa ’ s oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He was unharmed, but the video of the case quickly spread through social media.
The opening of Parliament was also marred by allegations by opposition members that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned not to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with boos.
Last month they booed him and interrupted him during his State of the Union speech in Parliament - that is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Spokesperson for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones warning them not to interfere with Mr. Mugabe ’ s speech.
"The news comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity ends in Parliament and that, as soon as they leave, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers for the politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the restructuring and saving efforts in the company ’ s services.
Later this year, HP will split into two listed companies, separating the computer and printer business from its fast-growing hardware and service business.
The expected job cuts will result in a burden of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, said HP in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will allow for a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard", said Meg Whitman, HP ’ s Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of businesses to help companies transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenues and “will be focused on providing unmatched, integrated technology, ” a statement said.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical installations and whose Palo Alto Garage has been called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world ’ s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US Tech companies, is the latest in the industry, based on the belief that tightly focused companies will perform better.
Arsenal team captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must stand behind injured Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger pointed out to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is going according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is still uncertain.
The big shame with this current problem is that Wilshere had ended the last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old momentum during the preseason.
“This kind of injury doesn ’ t threaten the career, ” Wenger said.
It is a bone that did not heal well.
This is not a major issue.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical perspective, but as Wenger acknowledged, there is the inherent risk of further injury whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The survey by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He also played in just 65 of Arsenal ’ s 157 league games over the past five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007-08 they have been one of the two Premier League clubs with the most injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in injury rates over the past season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat power," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and that he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal will begin its Champions ’ League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb before the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger will face a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta will start.
Wenger is also starting with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I ’ m trying to keep the balance and give the players who need it a little breather, ” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to advance through Group F, the Maksimir ’ s stadium in Zagreb is one of the most intimidating playgrounds in Europe.
Dynamo is undefeated even after 41 games, after the "invincible" campaign was started last season.
The stadium was hit by an earthquake on Tuesday night, with 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned the lesson from last season ’ s Champions' League surrender to Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club with his management to its first European Cup triumph.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
It has never worked with Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand I am in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy / show that gives us serious lessons about male friendships
The absence of similar depictions in shows is evident, especially in view of how the need for men to open up has now become more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men at a 15-year age prove.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of the Man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the fight to master this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course you first have to have friends in order for a friendship to work.
In the age of social media communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, joyful and successful, even when in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner yearning for personal development and friendship, which affects our mental health much more profoundly.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently stated, money really can ’ t buy happiness.
The great thing about Friends was that this focus was turned upside down.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shone through interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments watching football in cosy armchairs and Ross's longing for Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to it in any case, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As one counselor told me: "My role as a listener for people who feel depressed and at risk of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old saying "I get on with it" has an enormous effect, like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk openly about problems. "
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
She clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective outsider ’ s status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you ’ re visiting Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the redesigned backdrop to celebrate the day, why not take your friends with you for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends will be aired on Comedy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held their course as Paris Saint Germain kicked off its Champions League season with a very comfortable 2-0 win over Malmö at the Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria made his debut less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League as PSG ’ s player who put the French champion on his way, but then missed a number of opportunities before finally raising their lead when Cavani scored a header goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Shakhtyor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they are not only aiming for the qualification for the knockout rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they scored the points, it was not a class match of Laurent Blanc ’ s team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics that missed opportunities before the goal. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he began his illustrious career in 1999.
“It ’ s not easy to win the Champions League at home or abroad, so it ’ s a good start to winning 2-0, causing problems for our opponents and looking back relaxed, even if there are certain things we need to perfect over the course of the season, ” Blanc said.
"That is a good omen.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn ’ t score another goal or two. ”
The club returned to the Paris team after injury in one of three changes. The team managed to keep a 2-2 draw against Bordeaux in the first division at the weekend, but Di Maria beat him in the fourth minute.
The Argentinean winger was described as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when it was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he hinted at why, when he ran into Marco Verratti ’ s pass behind the Malmo, before he finished off past Johan Wiland beautifully into the long corner of the net.
However, if anyone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, that was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach that level, competed in Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was a tough opponent with a five-man defense and two deep in the midfield.
But except for a shot from Nikola Djurdjic, who missed Kevin Trapp ’ s post in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG sometimes gave up on himself, with some mispasses and bad deals, not least by Ibrahimovic, who failed in no less than five attempts in the first half alone and was then abandoned after Cavani had used him after the restart.
However, he showed much more skill in bringing his fellow players into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that turned Di Maria into a reel shot that Wiland passed the post in the 52nd minute...
The second goal finally fell short of the hours mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season after he picked up a left cross from Maxwell.
This ended all thoughts that Malmö could come back into the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from a very short distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before substitute player Ezequiel Lavezzi was deprived of a goal at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class above his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions' League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying matches are not enough. "
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through stock sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, hit by collapsing commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge debt redemption plan.
London registered Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth approximately £1.6 billion to pay off its own debt.

The stock jumped 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore announced last week the $2.5 billion share sale as part of its broader plans to pay off about a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new holdings at 125 pence per share, meaning a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half; coal, copper, and other commodity prices have fallen by 20-40%.

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented change to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European Champion Xavi plays since summer 2015 for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar
The FC Bayern obviously faced the signing of Spain's superstar Xavi, who played for the FC Barcelona at that time, a few years ago.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times cup winner, four times Champions' League 'winner, two times club' World Champion ', two times European Champion, one time World Champion - the titles' list of Xavi is breathtaking.
The 35-year-old left FC Barcelona in the summer after 24 years and moved to Al Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with the Marca, Xavi reveals that he had already left Barcelona before the European Championship 2008.
"They told me that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything, we won nothing," he says.
And that was also registered by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Ruminy wanted me."
As a reminder: In summer 2008 Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change
But the change did not come about.
And the decisive man for it today works for the German record champions: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great European Championship."
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change, that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"With that he got me."
Who knows how Bavaria's 2008 / 2009 season would have gone with Xavi?
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-final of the Champions League against the Bayern over the entire distance on the pitch, eliminated the red (4: 0, 1: 1) and celebrated at the end of the royal classes Triumph.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During an episode of Sunday Night of HBO ’ s Project Greenlight, experienced actor Brown interrupted as she emphasized the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black protagonist in the project ’ s chosen script.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it in the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show," Damon assured.
Brown reacted shocked, with offended disbelief, shouting "Hoo! Wow. Okay" as the comments of the actor of The Martian solidified.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and Farrelly ’ s brothers to discuss the show ’ s finalists.
"I would like to ask people to think about how they treat the character of Harmony, whoever the director will be," Brown said first.
The only black person, and she is a whore who is beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People stood up for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the direction of the film; Damon replied that their direction "in the end could give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was aired, social media exploded in disapproval of Damon ’ s comments.
Twitter-Users Mr Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO KNOW it hurts".
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon ’ s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved nationwide impact, urging legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter", (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have issued a statement in response to Fox ’ s question of whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
American Ninja Warrior crowns first champion
Professional climber and operator Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and take home the $1 million Grand Prix.
The competition “Show ”, which just finished its 7th season, had never seen a competition-team participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the finals.
The last task was climbing on a 75 foot long rope in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task within the time limit, making him the first athlete to complete the strenuous Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished the challenge full three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke with E! News after the hard-won victory, still in shock at winning the Grand Prix of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live on," Isaac E! said about his heap of money.
So all of a sudden.. as I can not even imagine how that is... the future is unknown.
The executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, despite being the first ever to finish the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
“If there ’ s more than one finalist, the one with the fastest time gets it, ” Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful prize and changes life, he gets the great bonus.
I don't think he has any grudges about that.
He is just so happy to have done what he has done.
Crowds of awards he received from fans.
He is such a great guy and a family man.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had switched roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, the shooting will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
In the past they were one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are on the last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins with 5 “4 ” in Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to advance within one half of the Houston Astros game for the second American League wildcard.
For Detroit, if only for one evening, it was a return of the three-letter F ’ word, which was so hard to grasp over much of the second half of the season.
"All victories are fun, no matter how it comes," said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger ’ s pitcher, Alfredo Simon, maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13 “9 ”) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 innings and made three runs possible.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to end this year strongly," said Simon.
It is hard to throw any game in the bullpen, so I want to concentrate on the game.
Tiger ’ s designated hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez ’ s first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the stick well," said Ausmus.
He looked good at the (punch training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it right into play.
With three runs behind at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton ended the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a Bunt, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overran Mauer, the only man he was confronted with, in front of the designated rookie "beat man" Miguel Sano, who snatched a two-and-a-half run from right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the conclusion of the second run, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the leading 27th time in the Major League this season that Plouffe beat a double play
After Detroit added an Insurance ’ s run at the end of the ninth inning, Mauer managed a RBI ’ s double against the Closer of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and scored the stand of 5
The right-hander, however, ousted Sano in three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited at the beginning of the game from a not yet movable Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been dropped from the list of injured players before the game after missing more than a month due to a back injury.
"Obviously not the start I was hoping for," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable when I got started and felt I was going to make some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After receiving the lead off in the first, Hushes gave a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
A "two out walk" for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who created a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez managed his 0 & 21 winning streak with the runners in the scoring.
The third baseman, Nick Castellanos, followed with a single on the right, making another run, but Victor Martinez was kicked out of the game as he tried to get to the third, ending the threat.
The Tigers advanced in the second, scoring a one-way out double from Catcher James McCann and a two-way out single from Center Fielder Anthony Gose at 3: 0.
“That was a big blow, ” said Twins ’ manager Paul Molitor.
He did not beat very well, but he got the right job.
Hughes was in a pitch-and-count, scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by relief right-handed A.J.Achter.
Hughes had three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
OBSERVATIONS: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez retired due to injury to the throw-shoulder.
It is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez ’ shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the list of injured due to a distortion of the shoulder, should be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is dropped from the injury list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1 and 1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30th
He has been missing since 20 August due to a tug in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2 Monate 2,4.43 ERA) wird gegen Minnesotas RHP Ervin Santana (5 Monate 4, 4.73) spielen
Hundreds of refugees to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night of Wednesday.
The people who arrived there are to be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She reckoned with 450 to 750 arriving refugees.
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days.
Up to 1000 refugees can be accommodated there temporarily.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
Alone in the past ten days according to data of the provincial council pouring responsible for the first admission 7500 humans had arrived in Hessen.
Due to the large number of refugees, Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up temporary accommodation in sports halls.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, sees military measures with German participation in Syria as a possibility.
"I believe that decisive reflection on options for military action cannot take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "collective looking the other way".
Four years ago, they were glad that Germany had passed the chalice of military involvement.
“Now the conflict lands crashing before our entry door ”, he said in the Deutschlandfunk.
The former German Ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controls the southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also reintroduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Minister of the Interior, Johanna Mikl, told the Austrian television station ORF on Tuesday evening that nobody would be sent back to Hungary.
Nor did Germany send any refugees back to Austria.
"No, it's agreed," she said.
On the question of an agreement under which Germany could take in a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl ’ Leitner said that there had already been talks in this regard between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not give any concrete figures and referred to talks in Berlin on Wednesday.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their destination is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian counterpart Werner Faymann, together with several other EU leaders, called for a special summit next week.
Germany began temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have not yet been able to agree on a joint approach to the crisis.
At a special meeting next Tuesday (22 September), the EU interior ministers intend to make a new attempt at the binding distribution of a further 120,000 refugees.
In view of the strong influx of refugees in Germany, the Federal Government intends to provide more support to the Länder in receiving and distributing refugees.
The federation will manage this together with the countries, announced Merkel on late Tuesday evening after nearly four-hour consultation with the Prime Ministers in the chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel underlined that those in need of protection would get it.
But those who have no prospect of remaining cannot stay in Germany.
This view was emphatically shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now master a "huge effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
On Tuesday night, Hungary closed its 175-kilometre-long border with Serbia.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also fence off the border with Romania.
Unlike Serbia, this neighbouring country belongs to the EU.
Hungary wants to prevent smugglers from crossing Romania, said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
Meanwhile, in Turkey, according to eyewitness accounts, thousands more migrants headed for the Greek border.
Space probe "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
Under the ice shield of Saturn's moon Enceladus a global ocean is spilling.
Researchers conclude this from observations of the space probe "Cassini".
Accordingly, the moon staggers slightly on its orbit around the ring planet.
This tumbling motion is only small, but still too large for a continuously solid celestial body, it is said in a message from Cornell University in Ithaca (United States of New York) on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the scientific journal "Icarus".
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
In 2006, for example, "Cassini" discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn's moon, which spew water vapour and ice particles and thus feed Saturn's so-called "E" ring.
At least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers concluded at the time.
The extent of the hidden ocean, however, was not clarified.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
1860 Munich has to forego offensive player Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation had resulted in an adductor injury in the 27 a year old, communicated the association.
Rama had already complained of pain at the beginning of the week.
According to the Munich Lions, the diagnosis means "probably four weeks compulsory break".
"This hits us hard, Rama is a bitter loss."
"Of course, we have to think about it now," said Sporting Director Necat Aygün to the Bild Newspaper, looking at the possible commitment of a clueless professional.
The sixties, however, initially presented a defensive man as a training guest.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was recently active in Belgium and was previously under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croat currently has "the opportunity to prove his skills".
Rubin Okotie can return to team training after his concussion next week.
Already on Thursday the Austrian international is to enter into running training.
In the match with Fortuna Düsseldorf (0-3) Okotie had injured his head in a violent collision.
Contrary to initial fears, however, he remained without a serious blow.
No Diet - Fruit - Mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy, sweet.
But who wants to pay attention to his slim line, is often rather discouraged by them.
Because mangoes contain relatively much sugar - above all sucrose.
Nevertheless, the exotic fruits are healthy: they contain B ’ s vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Above all, however, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta ’ s carotene.
Whoever eats the fruits thus supports eyesight, the immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The peel colour alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so even green mangoes can taste delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then they taste naturally pure or in sweet dishes.
But a mango also gives a special touch to savoury dishes.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicory and radiccio.
And a mango chutney goes well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The U.S. parcel service UPS hires for the Christmas business in the U.S. again up to 95,000 temporary workers.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS announced on Tuesday.
Drivers are mainly sought after.
Last year, UPS added 95,000 temporary workers to its workforce for the holiday season.
With online business booming, UPS and its competitor, FedEx, have been making early arrangements to prepare for the holiday season since last year.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought harsh criticism to parcel services.
First foehn storm, then distinctive cold front
In the coming night the foehn breaks through in the valleys of the north side of the Alps, as announced by Meteosschweiz on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and the night of Thursday, the foehn partly blows with storm strength through the foehn valleys.
After Föhende on Thursday morning a distinctive cold front crosses us, which brings strong rainfalls, gusts of wind and a drop in temperature.
As MeteoNews writes in a news release, Switzerland currently lies on the front of an extensive low-pressure area above the British Isles in a strong southwest current.
On the north side of the Alps the foehn breaks through the valleys in the night to Wednesday.
As a result, the foehn blows until Thursday morning in the foehn valleys with gusts of 60 to 100 km / h, occasionally and especially in Urnerland sometimes with over 100 km / h.
The Föhn can sometimes reach the adjacent Mittelland, and on the mountains even hurricane gusts of over 120 km / h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy foehn provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity on the southern slope of the Alps begins to accumulate.
This is where rain sets in, which lasts until Thursday evening.
In total, south of the Alps, over 100 litres of rain per square metre have to be expected in the next 48 hours, after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the Föhn runs out of air, followed by a cold front with heavy, partly thunderous rain from west to east over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front the wind refreshes strongly to stormy, and the temperatures decrease clearly.
The following days present themselves in the north autumnally with 15 to 20 degrees, in the south however it becomes sunnier and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a seat to Martin ’ s Luther
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin ’ Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of city mayor Ignazio Marino, a previously unnamed square in the park on the Oppio Hill was baptized on Wednesday in the name of the German reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now being honoured as the "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the heart of ancient Rome, next to the Coliseum.
The designation had been applied for by the Association of Protestant Churches in Rome.
On Wednesday, Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran congregation in Rome, recalled that the Protestants in the city of the popes for centuries as a minority often lived their faith in secret.
With the square it became symbolically visible that their tradition of the Christian faith was welcome in Rome.
As a young Augustinian monk, Martin Luther (1483 - 1546) spent a few months in Rome at the turn of the year 1510 / 11.
At that time he regarded the city as a depraved babel of sins.
According to historians, his negative impressions must have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome.
With his theses against the sale of indulgences, Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church.
Hammer Künstler invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gilded) crown of thorns is one of the major works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the Word?
No, not in the Otmar Alto Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent images.
In the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
The 75-year-old has received his "language" with colourful colours and imaginative shapes - but this is by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, it can look quite gloomy.
Otmar Alt worked for about three years on his project Bible, for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many thematic areas of the "Book of All Books".
The result are cycles dedicated to themes such as the Way of the Cross, plagues, commandments or Our Father.
He was able to fascinate several partners spontaneously: This applies to the Luther Verlag with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler Verlag with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective biblical passages on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" them into the present, into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Old Painting.
They are embedded between the original quotation from the Bible by Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The binding has golden letters.
The 75 Years old allows twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Ultimately, emotions were the very trigger for the Biblical project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter order.
"That's when the education happened with the cane", remembers Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to come to terms with this, in order to perhaps get along with my father again."
His second concern was to help art regain its status in a fast-moving time: "Nowadays the perception of visual worlds is shaped by advertising, and this is loud.
Symbolism is being suppressed.
Artists have a different desire and delight to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect I am a dinosaur".
Otmar Alt wants the viewer to let himself "fall" into the pictures, let them affect him, discover and feel what power they have: "The picture seeks its counterpart".
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar Alto Bible in the Otmar Alto Foundation that he has "always" been a lover of Otmar Alto's art: "I like how he understands life with his paintings".
Alt had not paid attention to fully grasp the Bible, but had chosen the subjects that were important to him and also mysterious.
"This was not a collaboration at eye level," says Altepost. "This is about the pictures, the text merely explains." The result was a picture, a Bible.
For Hans Möhler of Luther ’ s publishing house, this work is an invitation to “deepen one ’ s life and find freedom. ”
Otmar Alt ’ s paintings speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
A part of the originals - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition, which will be opened on 15 November in the Otmar Comment Foundation.
Construction Commencement of BMX Railway
Plans made, space found, contracted companies, modeled mounds of earth for a circuit: A year later, almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BMX track was already over again.
Failures in politics and administration caused annoyance, especially among the residents, who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So hills deported, new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The approval will be received in October, could the First Councillor Sabine Mosebach Bock now announced in the Children and Youth Committee.
"I hope that something visible will happen this year," she said.
Work on the former indoor swimming pool should then begin without a "further commemorative break".
DFB intensifies its commitment to refugees
The DFB is extending its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga is sending a clear signal at the weekend.
Football is reacting to the worsening situation in Germany and is assuring politicians of its help in overcoming the pending problems.
"I think this is the biggest challenge our country has faced since reunification."
"In principle, no one can say that I have nothing to do with it, I have nothing to do with it."
"Everyone has to be interested in getting a grip on this topic", said DFB head Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on 23 September, he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I will be in the Chancellery next Wednesday to meet Minister of State Mrs Özoğuz and the Chancellor."
"The issue will certainly play a central role here," he announced.
Football can and will help.
Politicians, however, must set the decisive course.
The German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative "1: 0 for a Welcome" by four years.
"Through the Egidius-Braun Foundation we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019", said Niersbach on the sidelines of the UEFA conference in St. Julian's / Malta.
Some Bundesliga clubs also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs will send out a clear signal when they wear the imprint "Wir helfen - # refugeeswelcome" on the left jersey sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make clear with it that everyone should help, where and how they can", said Leverkusens head of sport Rudi Völler of the "Bild" newspaper (Tuesday) and called the project "matter of course".
"The refugee drama concerns everyone, no one may look away."
"We can, no, we must use our charisma, our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim CEO Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
The women ’ s national team invites 100 refugees to Halle / Saale for the European Championship qualifier against Hungary this Friday.
Niersbach called the support of refugees "a great cooperative effort of German football".
It is great that all 36 licensing associations in their respective locations have started their own projects.
It is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The message "1: 0 for a welcome", which we have spent, is lived in football.
"That is of enormous importance," he said.
This year and next, the association, together with the DFB and the Federal Government, is making 300,000 euros available for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already called up the entire sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP Team Chairman loses eye in accident
The CEO of Europe's largest software company, Bill McDermott, has reportedly lost his left eye due to a fall in early July.
In the case of the accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the USA, he fell on a glass of water that he carried in his left hand after midnight, the "Wirtschaftswoche" reported on Wednesday.
"He almost bled to death, fainted, then dragged himself out onto the street - that's what he told us last week," quotes the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could do his job.
"At the beginning of October, we will meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully capable of working".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday issue) that he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company.
"I am fully dedicated to SAP, fully in my job."
"Of course I was in regular contact with the supervisory board and its chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," McDermott said to the "SZ".
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It was important to him to go public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "This can happen to anyone."
"It's important to get up again when you've fallen."
Magnussen out of the running...
Magnussen tweeted a photo and said he suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
At the night race in Singapore at the weekend, he will therefore not be considered as reserve driver for the two regular drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, just like one week later at the Japanese Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in goal
At Borussia Dortmund all hopes for a comeback of Marco Reus in the first group match of the Europa League have finally been dashed.
The international will be missing the championship leader of the Bundesliga in the duel with FC Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 / Sky).
"Unfortunately we can't fall back on him", Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga with a top match against Leverkusen, BVB coach left it open: "We expect a return from him to practice on Friday".
In view of the heavy burden of his professional players Tuchel will change his regular team not only on the Reus relegation position.
So he announced a change on the goalkeeper position.
Therefore Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Roman Bürki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether Weidenfeller will be used in future in all European league games, however, left Tuchel open.
With high probability he will also play the second match.
Julian Weigl, midfield player of the Europa League, considers it comprehensible to hear Reus' inquisitive statement that BVB's goal must be to qualify for the final: "Marco is not so wrong with that."
"I think we have a good chance to grab the title."
Robotic cars: Government wants to lead the way for Germany
The German government wants Germany to be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet adopted a strategy paper from the house of transport minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke of a "new age of mobility" on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the IAA motor show.
Automated and connected driving will improve road safety and reduce congestion, said Dobrindt.
He will also discuss the topic with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who will also meet representatives of industry at the ILO.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid switch to digital radio.
To test new technology, a test track is currently being built on the Autobahn 9 in Bavaria.
To ensure that the driver is "not burdened with any additional liability risks", the federal government wants to "review the legal framework and adapt it to the new developments where necessary".
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the speed limit for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 km / h.
The Federal Government also wants to push for an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which currently only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car increasingly takes the lead, the driver becomes more and more a passenger.
The technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically feasible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads were "not to be expected until well after 2020".
The authors of the study estimate the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany at around 8.4 billion euros for 2025.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic," said the SPD "transport politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of drivers' personal data must be clearly clarified.
But Germans still view self-driving cars skeptically - much more than French or Americans.
A survey commissioned by the Dekra testing organisation, which was presented at the Foreign Office on Wednesday, shows that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail in the next ten years, while 32 percent do not expect this to happen until 20 years from now, and 31 percent do not believe at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, and 33 percent in the USA.
In any case, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to surrender control during the entire journey on all roads.
On the motorway, this could be as much as 15 percent in traffic, and 45 percent in traffic jams.
A good one in four would under no circumstances leave control to the car.
Boll cancels Team- and Double Start at Table Tennis
The Düsseldorfer wants to serve up after current conditions with the title fights of 25 September to 4 October only in the single.
The final decision should be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys found out in the morning."
"We are strong enough to win the title without Timo", said national coach Jörg Roßkopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf.
At this time, Boll was on his way to a long-term sponsorship event in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo is the disadvantage, we are no longer such a clear favorite", declared individual European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The man from Hameln, who leads the seeding list in Yekaterinburg, also reminded of the 2013 European Championships in Schwechat.
"Timo was also missing at that time and we became European champions."
"That is what we should be guided by," declared world ranking number five.
Manchester United international Luke Shaw has sustained a serious injury to his right leg.
In the Champions' League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit by Héctor Moreno during a tackling and replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated a shin fracture for the 20-year-old teammate of Bastian Schweinsteiger.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a very big fashion show and a wax figure: the designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: mannequins that look alarmingly human thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who became a big star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and with it that he put men in skirts.
"I can no longer say that I am the enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair."
"It used to be bleached, now it's real," Gaultier said.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk", which can be seen from 18 September in the Kunsthalle of the Hypo - Cultural Foundation, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude towards a show about himself.
He was actually against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit like death," he said.
If you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had already made a stop in Montreal and Paris.
"It's so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits provide an insight into the work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed any training.
The show is not chronologically structured, but it is an excellently choreographed synthesis of the arts, for which a great deal of effort has been put in: for example, a stylist has been hired to dress the dolls.
According to the curator Thierry, Maxime Loriot, the makers brought 14 tons of material to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was another special treat: a lederhosen outfit with a corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and in people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier ’ s old teddy bear can also be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the designer ’ s first tentative, fashionable attempts at walking.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad at football) he wore his teddy bras and dresses, Gaultier said.
His parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later I bought them, of course.
He could not pay the models for his first own fashion show.
They got nothing, but were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of curtains - Plauen lace as a fashion niche
Previously, the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen were about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and laces were created in large quantities for customers who, for example, processed them into blankets and curtains.
That alone does not function today any longer, explains Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of the mode tip Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of Plauen lace, fashion played a major role, was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives some examples: lace in jewellery, in accessories such as bags and in regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past stylistic eras, an increasing order potential.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Fashion tip Plauen is, together with nine other companies, a member of the industry association Plauener Lace and Embroidery.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of turnover has been lost.
Private specialized shops and also the wholesale do not exist nearly any longer.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way.
Nowadays the mass-produced goods are produced much cheaper in Asia and almost exclusively distributed by chains.
In addition, exports, currently to Russia and the USA, are weakening.
Sufficient reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year, we have been carrying a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible".
Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used."
Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger branch of the Westsächsische Hochschule Zwickau - Faculty of Applied Arts - and specialises in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter the competition from the Asian area, one must find high-quality and innovative products.
This takes time and courage.
A field of tension arises between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies, which must above all think economically, "says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball lace.
The machine embroiders small balls in some places.
The master goldsmith from Plauen, Bianca Hallebach, was inspired by this: "Before I could not do anything with traditional Plauen lace".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In a complex process, she embosses the pattern in silver.
“Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauen lace – young and old, ” says Reuter.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and its surroundings and who want a souvenir.
I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Plauen lace.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" movie
You shouldn't touch legends, but Disney dares to make a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", however, this is not a remake, but a kind of sequel that plays with the magical nanny 20 years after the first film.
It is about the experiences of the nanny with the Banks family during the Great Depression in England.
It is still unclear who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews.
But the director is already certain: Rob Marshall, most recently in the cinema with "Into the Woods".
Xi pushes to open the economy wider to the world
The economy must be more open to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with directing reform on Tuesday.
"China should work to attract foreign investment and know-how and to improve business start-up strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group on Deepening Comprehensive Reform.
Promoting start-ups and reforms will create new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list to regulate market access, easing border controls, promoting SOE, raising private capital, and overhauling the resident reporting system.
After the statement, a negative list is drawn up that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually being tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensures a business environment governed by the rule of law and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also relax controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how to run their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
Other areas will be opened up to private investment as part of an offer to open up state-controlled sectors.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services to them," the statement said.
It will also make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or green card by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to exercise their functions and to appoint professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement released after the meeting.
EU to double mercury limit value in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish, thereby imposing a significantly higher dose of the neurotoxin on consumers.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding working paper from the EU, sharply criticised the plans: "The risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on to pregnant women and young children with full force", explained Matthias Wolfschmidt from Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons".
However, large predators are already so heavily contaminated with mercury that, on the basis of the limit values still in force, around 50 per cent of the catches may not be sold.
After doubling the limit values then only 14.5 per cent would be unsaleable.
In exchange for this relaxation, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to tighten the limit values for other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
However, Foodwatch called this a "trick", because smaller coarse fish, such as carp, are usually so low loaded that they already meet the planned maximum values.
The lowering of small fish is therefore "a perfidious diversionary manoeuvre that only helps the economy", Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans and accumulates strongly via the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "already small quantities can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in unborn children".
The Federal Ministry for the Environment declares on its homepage with regard to the valid maximum values that a "health endangerment of the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury enters the environment mainly through burning coal.
The German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tonnes of mercury a year, two-thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany, according to a written report by the Federal Environment Ministry to the Green Party member Annalena Baerbock.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube rivers, has been "permanently and comprehensively exceeded", "Spiegel" quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, pan-European warnings about mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU's RASFF alert system.
