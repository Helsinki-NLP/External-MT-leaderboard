The Prague Stock Exchange plunges into negative territory towards the close of business.
After the steep fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with CEZ shares reached almost half of normal daily business.
The Prague Stock Exchange picked up on Monday's slump at the start of Tuesday trading, when it fell another six percentage points.
This time, the reason for the slump was Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the market's reaction to the outcome of the vote by the US House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilization plan for the country's financial sector, is evident.
Stocks fall in Asia
Stocks in Asian bourses suffered a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indexes recovered some of their losses during the day.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng stock market index lost nearly four percentage points over the course of the business day, but later recovered some of the losses, easing to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five per cent, but then narrowed the losses to 4.3 per cent.
The Taiwan stock exchange fell 3.6 percent after the index there.
"The timing of the US bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world," said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Hong Kong, even though it is part of China, determines its own monetary policy, that is, independently of China's central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US lawmakers should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the blueprint for supporting the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will also be affected by the slump.
A bloodbath of American shares
The US House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which would cost up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion kƒç).
Lawmakers ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
In Bush's view, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis, thereby helping to stabilize the entire economy.
American stocks suffered a bloodbath on Monday, with major stock indexes recording their biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell nearly 7 percent, the last time it had a similar drop was in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but as soon as there were signs that the bill would not pass the House of Representatives, the index went into freefall.
Congress makes concession: US government allowed to pump $700 billion into banks
US congressional leaders and President George W. Bush's administration have agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the US financial system.
It is due to be voted on early next week.
US lawmakers reached a breakthrough in talks to approve a $700 billion (about 12 trillion kronor) bailout for the US financial system.
However, this does not mean victory yet.
Members of Congress still have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be debated in the US Congress on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
The plan could likely not be voted on in the Senate until Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, a notification that the plan will be adopted should be the first significant psychological factor in stimulating financial markets.
After that, however, there is "disillusionment" with the complicated mechanisms for helping the markets in practice.
Paulson: The Plan Must Be Effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our differing views on what a package to stabilize the market should look like, "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, told Bloomberg.
She said a final vote could come as early as Sunday.
Lawmakers met with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to finalize the government fund.
This provides for the purchase of unsaleable mortgage assets by financial companies, which cause financial firms to incur heavy losses and jeopardise the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must be effective in the market.
We need to continue with the recovery plan, but I think we are on track, "Paulson said.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
Democratic Senator Harry Reid of Nevada said lawmakers were trying to reach a final agreement in Congress before Sunday.
The move is intended to reassure investors ahead of deals in Asian financial markets, which are in the early days of the year when a decision by Congress could affect business on Monday.
But it is not yet clear when both chambers of the US Congress will vote on the bill, and it is unclear whether the last-minute negotiations might still fail because of a problem.
Lawmakers hope to pass it in the next few days.
The law, however, will undergo some changes.
The total amount allocated to the system will be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
But Congress can block the distribution of the remaining money if it feels that the program is not performing its function, with another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush sees positive progress in negotiations
The president has veto power over the decision, but Congress can override its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was based on obtaining finance to buy bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages, has remained intact.
'We've worked it all out.
The House should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday, "said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush was also pleased with the progress.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and "appreciates the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the lead negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed on responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing perks and setting a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law will also limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and establish a committee to oversee the fund.
This is to be run by the Treasury.
"We have worked very hard on this and made great progress toward a deal that works and is important to the market and to all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also includes help for homeowners who are struggling to repay their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates on the mortgages it buys, with the goal of lowering the monthly cost to borrowers and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but implementation will be very difficult.
"This is because we do not know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be bought up.
That will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government share the losses, "Marek told iHNed.cz. this week.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week does not matter, according to Marek.
"It is much more important that members of Congress agree to support the plan and pass it as quickly as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that it will be adopted is the most important thing at this moment, "Marek stressed.
Duel on a knife edge: MP3 players versus mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls yet.
So, of course, it looks like it's better to buy just one phone.
Nevertheless, there are plenty of reasons why you should buy a stand-alone player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
Sure, it's hard to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
For one thing, such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with art rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, you are probably dreaming of at least one.
This is also the case with music on the move, i.e. with compressed music, put simply - music in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For some, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand kroner on a player, but equally, a Pink Floyd fan will hardly be able to take headphones off the market for twenty kroner.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The service life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play a lot more than just music, but they don't even manage to do what mobile phones can do.
No modern device is as universal as the telephone.
In addition to its primary functions, telephony and sims, it can play music and video, record both, have a better camera and a worse camera, and may also be able to navigate.
And if you include smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle, because no fridge can barbecue and no TV can take pictures.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you will need to recharge it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy guzzlers.
Only a few mobile phones can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, in most cases it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
This is why you should expect the cheap mobile phones to be able to play no more than a few hours of music.
If you still make calls from time to time, it is better to buy a charger for the office as a safety measure - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good ones can withstand at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one charge.
Another problem is when you want to transfer the music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB connection, and not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can transfer the music directly to a storage device, but only a few card readers can cope with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones without reduction.
With the exception of iPod players, you do not need any special software.
All you need to do is feed the device with music from your PC via USB port.
Most mobile phones and players create a music library themselves, ordered by the name of the artist, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the rating by users.
Some devices only display the tree of the address directory, similar to Windows Explorer, some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, phones can do more
When selecting a specific device, you should inquire in particular about the service life of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and type of sound and, of course, the ease of use.
If music is primarily a backdrop for you and you only listen to it briefly every day, for example on the tram, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is sufficient.
Which almost every mobile phone can do.
You also don't have to control which music formats a phone or player can handle.
MP3s create all of them, and most of the music you get will just be in this format.
The format is one of the most widely used, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better phones also allow you to buy music online.
All you have to do is access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile internet, and you can then purchase a song or album.
This service can in itself be a powerful argument for why you should buy a music mobile phone.
Unfortunately, the service offered by the providers is poor and is mostly limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this type of music sales (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their mobile phones with them.
If you feel like listening to something, grab your phone in your jacket pocket while the player is at home.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless hands-free device.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker that almost every mobile phone has, but only the fewest MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music phones will be the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you get a decent walkman.
The biggest handicap for most will be that there are no normal headphones included.
The best and most sophisticated phones with a 3.5mm aperture for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players is the ease of use.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - players can be used by anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the formerly normal cassette recorder or, for example, the turntable, is obvious.
There is no threat of a collision in the form of an erroneous mobile internet and a subsequent horrendous bill for data transfers.
Which device should you reach for now?
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns will suffice.
But beware.
The basic models usually only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can read 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and still want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, then reach for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
If you are one of the more demanding handsets, take more specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3, and the ease of use comes close to that of a single MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman phones have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players, is the furthest ahead.
The same services in the same price range of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players of the above manufacturers.
The first virtual provider will come to the Czech Republic already this year.

The mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer practically all the services offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classical ones to lower prices.
Perhaps this will not be long in coming.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that Czech mobile operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the ƒåT√ö telecommunications authority, which pointed out that the price of an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the European Commission's latest steps in regulating roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition to really challenge.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, given that there are three mobile networks in the Czech Republic and penetration is well in excess of 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to complain about the extremely high level of competition on the Czech market.
Pavel Dvo≈ô√°k, President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ƒåT√ö), who has often said in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic, agrees.
It is probably true that a traditional provider with its own network does not have very many chances anymore (by the way, it would probably find hardly any frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market brought with it a significant price reduction, to which then also the classical mobile telephony providers had to react.
Even before such companies as Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, there were similar voices to those in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you don't have to look far for examples.
In February of this year we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, it has managed to attract more than 100,000 customers, making it the fifth largest provider in the country.
The financial group behind Mobilking is Penta, which owns U: fon, among others, in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can concentrate on a much more concrete target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need far fewer customers than a traditional provider.
After all, they do not need relatively high costs to build, operate and maintain a mobile network.
In the world, these virtual providers usually present themselves as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, but this is often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half the price of its rivals.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to target a non-stereotypical audience.
This provider is specifically targeted at men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the virtual provider's operator.
It is difficult to say whether a concept similar to that used in Poland could take root in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav ƒåepick√Ω doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
It is also relatively saturated from the point of view of services. "
Opportunity in the Czech Republic, say mobile operators
But it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile operator conquers the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"Although we are talking about an expansion of this successful project, the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look very hopeful.
It is more likely that mobiles will enter the market in other countries of our region, "Jana Studniƒçkov√°, spokeswoman of the Penta financial group, said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything they can to avoid creating a potential competitor.
For some time now, the GTS Novera group has been showing its interest in launching a virtual mobile operator, which would like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telef√≥nica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a strong interest in offering not only fixed telecommunications services but also mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already been able to make progress in the negotiations, "said the group's spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe better times are coming.
According to unofficial information, the first virtual vendor may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a fully-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area has approached us, "says Vlastimil Sr≈°e≈à from the Telef√≥nica O2 press department in his statement for Mobil.cz.
The specificity of the Czech market is also pointed out by other suppliers.
In rare agreement with O2's statement, T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrov√° added: "So far, we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which to build further."
She adds: "By the end of the year, hardly any virtual providers will appear on T-Mobile's network.
At this moment we should already have a concrete offer, in order to be able to think in such a short time. "
Vodafone focuses its attention more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav ƒåepick√Ω commented: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
From the customer's point of view, this is precisely what we consider to be the best.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for high-speed mobile internet. "
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the providers
It is easy to understand the actions of mobile operators: adding another operator would mean more competition, which would lead to lower prices and thus lower profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
The fact that providers can pull together when it comes to something is also evidenced by the long back-and-forth over the emergence of U: fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards ƒåT√ö came from T-Mobile at the time when U: fon entered the market.
This is also evidenced by publicly available information from ƒåT√ö websites.
But U: fon is a good argument for not allowing a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrov√° commented: "The competitive environment in the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, on its services. "
Given this approach by mobile operators, however, the complete lack of interest of Czech regulators is surprising.
This is not just the attitude of ƒåT√ö, which unfortunately - unlike the UK and other highly developed countries - does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It is exclusively owned by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (√öOHS).
This, however, took its very typical stance on this whole issue.
"The market entry of a mobile virtual operator would be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile operator and a virtual provider for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the traditional providers, "says Kristi√°n Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the √öOHS in his answer to our enquiry.
Such a formulation would not come as a surprise to providers' representatives.
From an authority that is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses their position in the market, this is more than questionable.
Especially when Kristi√°n Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual operators operate as normal, it is noticeable that their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in the price of mobile telephony services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are probably not in the interests of the √öOHS.
What is truly shocking about this case is the almost touching consistency of the three mobile operators in their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely identical price of petrol at petrol stations is surely just a coincidence and the result of fierce competition.
"The Authority has found no indications of anti-competitive behaviour in this case and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market.
The telecoms regulator probably lacks the tools needed to open up the mobile market to virtual operators, "Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of dominance in the market is one of many contentious points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, developed by ƒåT√ö, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators has a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - for a virtual provider to enter the market, the agreement of the network operator is always necessary.
And, logically, the mobile operator has a monopoly on its network.
This means that it necessarily occupies a dominant position in a particular segment.
Even if you disagree with that argument, it should at least be a warning to the NHS that three mobile phone providers are operating in strikingly similar circumstances.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles when negotiating with all providers.
Shifting responsibility to ƒåT√ö is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services by which the √öOHS distances itself from the whole issue.
This has already been observed in a number of similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act did not succeed in extending ƒåT√ö's competences to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, even though a number of experts had hoped it would improve the situation.
The representatives of the √öOHS need to know this all too well, but they probably have other interests.
It works when no one is looking
First of all, the functioning of some pseudo-virtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partially public.
Normally these are companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others offer their own mobile telephone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the chosen ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company presents itself to the operator as a classic corporate customer ordering a large quantity of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he will then receive special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, it may be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will deal with, which may lead to the termination of cooperation with the respective company," Martina Kemrov√° replied to our question on this issue.
However, it is very unlikely that such a thing will not spread among the leaders of mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator is opposed to such an approach.
In fact, they derive not negligible profits from the activities of these companies, and at the same time, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav ƒåepick√Ω draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows for this kind of speculation, but in spite of everything, only a very small percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone does not have their name on it, so they cannot have full access to it like the normal customers of mobile operators. "
That alone, however, should at least seem strange to ƒåT√ö.
There is also a further question for the √öOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to such an approach, why are they blocking a virtual provider?
It should be added that the √öOHS has quite strong powers to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the declaration by the providers that they do not know about it and that their terms and conditions prohibit it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has been emphasised several times in the text, the entry of virtual providers has led to a significant drop in prices for the various services.
In practically all countries where virtual providers have emerged, traditional providers have tried to prevent their emergence to a greater or lesser extent.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market that was too small or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the advanced countries, however, it was precisely at these moments that regulators intervened, not to protect the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal printing, they succeeded in creating the first virtual operator, and others followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing the whole case at themselves like a hot potato.
On the basis of our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that ambiguity in competences is more than favourable in these cases.
But let's not throw the shotgun in the ring.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider emerges soon, the Czech mobile market may soon start moving again.
If a provider allows the emergence of a mobile virtual operator, the √öOHS will not stand idly by when it comes to rejecting (discriminating against) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will finally no longer be making more expensive calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Pick the best one
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol√°nek presented new recordings of the national anthem, Where is My Homeland, at a ceremony to mark Czech Statehood Day.
The anthem was newly recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji≈ô√≠ Bƒõlohl√°vek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo vocals, in a choral version and in an instrumental version.
The vocal version was performed by Kate≈ôina Knƒõ≈æ√≠nkov√° and Adam Plachetka.
Arrangers of the anthem versions are Otakar Jeremi√°≈° and Jaroslav Krƒçek.
You can listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz server.
For Bƒõlohl√°vek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had previously told Czech Radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices, who are distinctive and popular, for the solo versions.
"From the beginning, I tried to keep a clear diction with both of them, and then with the choir, so that the text could be well understood, so that harmony could be created," says the conductor.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m≈Øj was first performed in 1834 on the stage of the Estates Theatre in the originally Czech piece Fidlovaƒçka by Josef Kajet√°n Tyl, the music was by Franti≈°ek ≈†kroup.
It became popular, and people embraced it spontaneously.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse of the song became an organic part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What does the "new" anthem sound like?
Prague transport companies will also carry a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, 1 October 2008, will go down in the history of Prague public transport as the date on which the first passengers to board a metro, tram or bus will carry an electronic coupon instead of a paper ticket.
Currently, about one hundred thousand people with the OpenCard chip card can buy these cards.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day coupon, a 90-day coupon or an annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and have it applied to their smart card at the same time at the information centres and branch offices of transport companies at the Muzeum, M≈Østek, N√°dra≈æ√≠ Hole≈°ovice, Andƒõl, Roztyly, Let≈àany, Kobylisy, Rajsk√° zahrada, Kaƒçerov and Luka metro stations.
As of yesterday, coupons are also available on the Internet at www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers into the afternoon hours.
Those who use the Internet can really forget the issue window in the subway stations, where they used to regularly have to wait in long lines for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon via the Internet, which is then transferred to the OpenCard in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
"Travellers will also have access to a counter with trained staff at these points, which will advise interested parties on internet purchases and also display the coupon on the card," says project spokesman Martin Opatrn√Ω.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be applied to the OpenCard at self-service vending machines installed in some underground vestibules.
What do such vending machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket validators. Passengers may have already noticed them at the underground stations Roztyly, Budƒõjovick√°, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk√°.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year it should be eighty," Opatrn√Ω adds.
A vending machine controls the coupon instead of the driver
The operation of the machines, which will work from tomorrow, is simple.
All you have to do is insert the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon plays itself out.
From tomorrow, the electronic coupons will be valid not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
In other words, on suburban trains and on bus lines numbered 300 to 499, which mainly serve the inhabitants of municipalities in the Central Bohemia region.
"On trains belonging to Prague Integrated Transport, train attendants have reading devices with which they can check the validity of coupons in terms of time and zone," explains Filip Dr√°pal from the Ropid organisation, which compiles timetables for Prague transport companies.
Suburban buses have card readers at the driver's checkout.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be presented to the driver, but the OpenCard must be placed at a designated location on the side of the cash register.
This enables the driver to check the validity of the coupons uploaded.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information," says Dr√°pal.
A passenger who does not use suburban buses and does not know when the coupon expires can go to the self-service vending machines where the coupons will be added to the card.
Here the information on the validity of his documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudetenland demanded a referendum from the USA
In 1945 the Sudeten Germans had asked for the annexation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States.
This is evident from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Research Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would at least like to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans are said to have turned to the US President in 1945.
This is evident, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and which is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Research Library.
In the letter, the Germans of Krumlov ask the American president not to allow the return to Czechoslovakia of the "Sudetengau" - captured by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure that the American units will enter German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," reads a letter signed with the words "People who care about the fate of the Sudeten people."
Since the annexation of Czechoslovakia led the Sudeten Germans - knowing the Czech national character - to suspect that they would expect brutality, ruthlessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protection of the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you award this territory to a foreign state that oppresses and seeks to eliminate minorities and has contributed nothing whatsoever to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of vengeance on the part of the "Czech oppressors."
If the US President had any doubts about the attitude of the Sumava Germans, it would be sufficient for him to initiate a referendum in the Sumava region on whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the USA or to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today's knowledge of post-war history, according to some contemporary witnesses it paints a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even if the Bohemian Germans had at least an inkling that they would be deported from the Republic, only a few of them even admitted such a possibility.
Some waited for the United States and Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Still others believed they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
During the war he was employed as a Budweiser German in the navy at the Baltic Sea.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, it would suit them," Chalupa said.
In his opinion, none of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected to be expelled from the republic on the basis of the Bene≈° decrees.
If you don't think so, then pay!
An emotional campaign aimed at motorists
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
That, too, is how one might characterize the emotive media campaign that the Department of Transportation plans to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Ale≈° ≈òeb√≠ƒçek's authority hopes to dissuade drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will be shown on television, on the radio, in the cinema, on the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is designed to dissuade drivers from speeding and drink driving.
And also remind them to fasten their seatbelts before driving.
Above all, the campaign aims to inspire the consciences of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the commercials?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign bears witness to this:
If you don't think so, then pay!
The words "don't think" are written in capital letters on a license plate.
And in a pool of blood there is the word "pay."
This means that you can pay for a moment of inattention with your own life.
The commercials will "shock" viewers by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where it is normal to see pictures with dramatic images of accident victims.
It is hoped that this will reduce the number of accidents and fatalities on Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Carrot and stick for motorists
"For the drivers, the motto is carrot and stick.
Carrot means that they save time, for example, when they drive in red.
The whip is then the threat of a penalty or an accident.
The driver needs to be reminded of the risk, "said traffic psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital Martin Ko≈ô√°n.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
In his opinion, signs alerting drivers to a danger are already less effective.
"If you put up a static board warning of a danger, it will probably soon disappear with the environment and drivers will no longer notice it," says Ko≈ô√°n.
Olmert Would Return Almost All Occupied Territories in Exchange for Peace
The head of Israel's provisional government, Ehud Olmert, has called for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace can be made with Palestine and Syria in exchange.
This was emphasized in an interview published on Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to cede a similar percentage (of Israeli territory) to the Palestinians, because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He acknowledged that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors or bulldozers rolling over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert said, alluding to two attacks in the city in July that killed several people and injured dozens.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Temple Mount and sacred and historical places" located in the territory of the Old Town.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That's not going to work, "he said.
Deduction from the Golan Heights
Olmert advocated for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said is an essential condition for concluding a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert said.
"The Syrians know all too well what they have to give up in order to regain the Golan Heights.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the Al-Qaeda terrorist network and the jihad (holy war) in Iraq, "the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, walking around in a long-distance coach is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of a Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arises as to whether stewards and passengers are allowed to walk back and forth on the bus during the journey.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the Road Traffic Act," said Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident that killed a twenty-two-year-old flight attendant last week was likely caused by the driver of the truck that crossed the bus's path.
To make matters worse, the young woman was sitting next to the driver in the least safe seat in the car at that moment, although she had two more seats available.
But a bus can also have an accident or brake sharply the moment the steward delivers coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role whether the bus is equipped with standing room according to the vehicle registration form.
If this is not provided for on the bus, passengers must be seated.
Long-distance coaches of Student Agency do not have standing places, which the director of the company, Radim Janƒçura, confirmed to Aktu√°lnƒõ.cz.
"We discussed this with the ministry and this initially did not agree to the movement of travellers.
It was later reversed and we reached a consensus that passengers should be allowed to use the toilet during the journey if they have their seat, "he said.
The law has no steward
'There is no clear legal interpretation of a steward's role - no legislation describes that role.
However, there is also no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act recognizes only the concept of vehicle conductors, but does not define their rights and obligations, "adds Ministry spokesman Hanzelka.
However, Josef Pokorn√Ω, Director of the Road Vehicles Division of the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law covers this issue retrospectively.
"It depends on whether the bus has standing room in the product approval.
That's all, "he says.
Buses are divided into city buses, where standing places are available and the speed limit is limited, local buses with standing places and a higher permitted speed and long-distance coaches without standing places with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As in an airplane, says the expert
BESIP road safety expert Jaroslav Ho≈ô√≠n does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board buses.
"When driving fluently, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to service on board an aircraft.
Again, it's not clear when turbulence will occur and the stewardess may hit her head. '
"But if a bus brakes sharply, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a tram.
The safety of stewards must be clarified by the carrier through internal regulations, "he says, adding that from the point of view of the law, this issue is not fully resolved.
Janƒçura ready to cut services
Student Agency is the only bus company offering stewards services.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The director does not regard her profession as risky even after the accident.
'But as soon as I get the impression that the steward's job is risky, I'll delete it.
Travellers can get coffee and newspapers as they board.
That would also cut costs, "he says.
Asiana director Alexei Litvin attributes the lack of stewards on his buses to safety concerns, but his company operates only a fraction of routes compared with Student Agency.
'We don't have stewardesses, we've been fighting against this from the beginning.
Sooner or later this ends with some kind of fatal accident, "he told T√Ωden.cz less than a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy.
A young air stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the company for two years, was killed in an accident on a regular bus to Naples.
The Slovenian lorry had probably turned off the stationary lane without blinking and had blocked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to swerve through a sharp manoeuvre but collided with the right front section of the truck.
Janƒçura denies that the two seats for the stewards were sold.
'These seats can't be reserved for long-distance connections, they're blocked. '
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but it also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
A change in the law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring about a statutory regulation, on which a team of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year.
"However, this has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, but rather the points system, the speed limit on the motorway and the use of mobile phones when driving, "says expert Ho≈ô√≠n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards to be something that could substantially jeopardize the safety of passengers," said Hanzelka, although the control of bus safety is the competence of the police and the occupational health and safety authorities.
D√ºsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
There is no lack of big words in the letter from the WestLB board to the employees of the company.
The letter, which became public on Monday, states that the merger of units of the D√ºsseldorf financial institute with the Frankfurt-based Deka Bank could create "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe."
WestLB would bring a "competence bloc" with sustainable earning power into such a business.
And in general, such a link could be the decisive impetus for further bundling in the state banking sector.
This is how it reads when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
For the beleaguered WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also on the part of the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt f√ºr Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht), which only recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalian state government that time is pressing to find a solution for the future.
However, there has been talk for some time - including on the Frankfurt side - of some sort of connection between Deka-Bank, which savings bank customers know because of its investment funds, and WestLB.
While presenting the half-year figures at the end of August, Deka Bank CEO Franz Waas let it be known that he saw no point in merging the company on Mainzer Landstra√üe with a Landesbank, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, half-owned by the Landesbanken and half by the Sparkassenverb√§nden, has instructed the Management Board to hold talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be the capital markets business or parts of it.
The talks have, however, only just begun, according to people in the financial centre.
This is not the first time that Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of the most important employers in the Frankfurt financial centre when it comes to consolidation in the savings bank sector.
For a moment in 2003, it looked as if Deka-Bank could merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
This trifecta, however, became nothing.
No sooner had the plans become public than the Hessian State Government spoke out against Helaba's participation in them.
The other two houses did not find each other either.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead went to Landesbank Baden-W√ºrttemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been mind games about linking the Deka Bank with Landesbanken.
Most recently, however, G√ºnther Merl, CEO of Helaba, had spoken out against simulation games about merging with his company.
Independently of this, however, the recognition seems to be maturing that it is necessary to bring the different houses of the public sector closer together.
Now that the state election in Bavaria is over, a connection between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-W√ºrttemberg could be the first step.
This is not necessarily good news for the Helaba.
If pressure grows for further mergers, it will gradually run out of partners.
In the south it would only be a junior partner, although it has so far weathered the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Th√ºringen, which holds an 85 percent stake in Helaba, put an end to a merger with West LB.
That would leave the Northern League at best.
But such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the story.
On the other hand, it is a question of how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl said that the crucial question of which business model was to be used to ensure the future viability of Landesbanken had not yet been answered by the German Savings Banks and Giro Association (Deutscher Sparkassen- und Girroverband).
At the end could also be a dismantling of West LB, which is, of course, not desired there.
For example, the letter from the executive committee there mentions that a "total solution" for the house is being sought in any case.
How this can be reconciled with the merger of individual units with the Deka Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of weddings is known as the "Italian weekend"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is his girlfriend, so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre beer keg of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bearded tiger, proving to the 200 or so Oktoberfest travellers what deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca first a slap, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, in the bus park next to the Puorta Nuova train station, four buses depart this evening at 11.45 p.m., "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra," arriving at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, one bus is exclusively for Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated in the night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, it's not for Italians.
Marco, who is wearing a long coat with fur lining and glasses with wide silver temples, is among the coaches.
They have been going to Oktoberfest for five years, with three tours this year alone.
At night, during the day on the Oktoberfest, at 22.30 clock back.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian Purity Law, health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
And the buses roll into the night, on the autostrada in the direction of "Brennero."
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly it gets quiet on the bus, the travellers sleep.
Well, they will still need their strength.
The stops will be in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian number plates will also take a break on the motorway 8 just before Munich.
When Marcos group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half past seven in the morning as planned, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a last speech, explains the plan of attack.
Firstly, put on the yellow cap.
On the left is "Oktoberfest," in Fraktur, next to it the Internet address of Marcos travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it."
Second: "When the doors to the beer tent open, it's time to run!" exclaims Marco into the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats at the back of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we will block, and not distribute all the yellow caps on the same benches in the room!"
The measurement, Marco bellows, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget to tip.
"Show the security people that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the places, they're gone! "
Thirdly, 'Arrive here again tonight at half past five!'
And off we go to the Oktoberfest.
Along the way, one binds yellow caps as waymarks to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian people's party.
They want to be prepared for retreat.
It is the second weekend of the year, known as the "Italian weekend."
Exact figures are not available; there is talk of 50 000 making their way across the Alps and invading the beer tents; ten per cent of all visitors are said to have travelled from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven policemen from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which keeps a national statistic in which the Italians take first place ahead of the British (about 60 missions) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical supplies.
The Hofbr√§uzelt is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, stressed Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbr√ºck only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and also intertwined that the German banking sector would not be spared from the crisis developments.
Because that's what happened at the weekend.
Dax-listed Munich real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE) has received a multi-billion euro loan from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turbulence on the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loans amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate would only have to pay interest on the part it claimed.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is losses at the subsidiary Depfa.
According to a newspaper report, the state-owned lender had refinanced itself at extremely short notice for long-term projects for which it had lent money - which is no longer possible due to the distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the Bank's cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had also fallen slightly from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, while income from write-downs on receivables and certain securities and from the reversal of provisions in the lending business fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher income from refunds of downstream settlement costs arising from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as from the reimbursement of interest pursuant to the German Tax Code and from the provision of business for group companies, the earnings decline was moderate at around 16 percent.
Following its privatisation in 1990, the former state-owned financier initially speculated on commercial real estate loans, which were then spun off at Aareal Bank.
Because it earned too little in classical state financing, Depfa then became increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects by private investors and the state (private-public partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate will now have to write down the value of the subsidiary, which will have a "material material material effect" on the group's income statement, it said.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
It had already been cut by two thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financier since the Depfa takeover.
It is more reliant than other institutions on wholesale funding because it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, bank lending has largely dried up again, as banks hoard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate annually needs short-term funds for refinancing part of Depfa's loan portfolio - around EUR 50 billion.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the financing needs of the group are covered by the loan for the foreseeable future and the company is shielded "from the influence of the currently largely dysfunctional international money markets."
Other sources have said that the money will secure the refinancing until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, CEO of HRE, stated that Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to use the money markets for the foreseeable future.
Bundesbank and Bundesanstalt f√ºr Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group has now been secured.
That is to be hoped for by the bank's shareholders and creditors.
But given the dynamics and imponderables of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
Indeed, it is not inconceivable that the funding will not have to be fully used.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the bank was reportedly still on the verge of insolvency late on Sunday evening, even the rescue, at least for the time being, is unable to calm tempers.
The share price slumped 75 per cent to ‚Ç¨3.30.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are holding up pretty well.
While senior debt shows little movement, subordinated bond prices are falling more sharply.
The bonds of the former subsidiary W√ºrttemberg Hypo and, understandably, the maturities beyond 2009 are particularly affected.
If hypo-real estate bonds used to be a speculative investment alternative, their value must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the significant worsening of the banking crisis and of the institution itself, which had only brought the crisis into its own hands by taking over Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less troubled commercial banks are still prepared to support the system, pensions can be expected to be repaid on time.
Or what few dare now hope will happen - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
But, in the light of the news that part-nationalisation is fast approaching, the probability that it will happen is now only a reasonable hope.
This is likely to cause long-term creditors in particular a few sleepless nights deciding whether to part with their engagements.
Short-term investors can at least use a draw to make a loss carryforward for future withholding tax payments on stock market gains in later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start giggling: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from manga - in the new exchange log she talks about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Even before I got to school, I had bumps.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take a 40-minute train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way on my own, luckily I did not get lost.
The beginning of classes at the Tachibana does not seem to be as strict as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students arrive from eight o'clock until a short meeting with the teacher, the 'home room', begins at twenty to nine.
But before the lessons began, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of guy who likes to speak in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I did not yet have a school uniform, I put on an old skirt of my host mother, a blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the desk and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and it's my birthday in a week.
At that moment I was very happy that I had already started to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all hugged, giggled and waved, and I kept hearing the word "kawaii."
I already knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means' cute, sweet '.
Then I rushed to my seat.
The girl next to me smiled quite broadly, she thought it was an honour that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was really taken aback.
Everyone was talking and giggling and asking me holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the break everyone unpacked their Bentos.
My host mother had also made me such a lunchbox - this is something different from the dreary German interval loaves.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and some kind of meat wrapped in tofu.
Usually I don't have a clue what exactly I'm eating here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
What is certain is that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty prunes, maybe, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a homemade bento, which she then prepares especially artfully - in the hope of getting to know the boy better while having a break.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm curious to see if I can observe it here.
'Why Japan of all places? 'my girlfriends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said:
'Because I'm fascinated by it. '
After all, I've loved reading manga for years.
And to get a better understanding of the comics and the culture in them, I started to learn a bit of Japanese at some point.
So it was very clear to me that I had to come here at some point.
Because I also have a soft spot for traditions, customs and customs.
And they are very important here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I didn't feel lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen. "
Rats also have feelings
A rat or cockroach flees in case of danger does that mean that it also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
But how could you check if they feel the same if they behave in a similar way to us?
Contributions from famous scientists have been published in the Internet journal "Edge" for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents a series of selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it until now, when we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and address issues of feeling or consciousness in general, we enter rough terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it pretends to be dead, escapes or attacks.
Humans behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its involvement in short-term memory and execution / control functions).
This wide region is much more highly developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be completely absent in other creatures.
So, at least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that humans are different even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity may lie in the linguistic nature of human beings: since so much of their experience is linked to language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is likely to be very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness might look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it cannot be measured or analyzed on the basis of our own experience because of the special hardware, its exploration presents us with great problems.
Most of what I have said refers to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
One could study the processes of consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what is happening in studies of short-term memory in primates, especially visualization.
But this approach, pursued by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, relies more on the neural correlates of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
So what are the sensations?
I attribute it to the fact that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain that is conscious of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state we are in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies memory.
From this point of view, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and, in particular, humans.
Connected with the linguistic nature there are subtle gradations of feeling, because we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of words and grammar, in order to ascribe them to others as well as ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations arise from more primitive activities in the bodily emotional regions of the cortex and brain stem, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in intergenre sensations.
In purely theoretical terms, I cannot contradict this, but I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what seems like fear in rats and humans probably feels like fear in both cases: but how can one verify whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach flees in case of danger if it also feels fear?
In my eyes, mere behavioural similarity cannot yet prove equality of experience.
The neural comparison helps: Rats and humans have similar brain strains, but cockroaches don't even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if we could prove it in humans, how would we prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior of rats rather than the emotional sensations.
In any case, progress on the neural level beckons here, provided the same is measured in rats and humans.
Just as I do not research language and consciousness in rats, nor do I study sensations, I do not know whether they exist.
You might think that is short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward than constantly run into a wall.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa president Platini: Reprieve for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunik said that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a vote of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the European Championship together with Poland," Wasjuk said.
'But this isn't an amnesty for our country.
Work has only just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries. "
The two hosts are lagging behind on the timetable for building or rebuilding stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
It is even possible that the number of European Championship stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
'We can't waste any more time.
We have to work at top speed now, "said Ukrainian federation president Grigory Surkis.
'UEFA will keep an eye on us, 'he said.
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of the Minister of Sport, Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious risk that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
'We have sent a letter to Uefa president Michel Platini assuring him that preparations for Euro 2012 will not suffer as a result, 'he said.
Last season alone, several Premier League clubs were condemned to forced relegation due to manipulation, after all, even the start of the league had to be postponed at short notice.
Outraged Dennis Quaid hits back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke about her private life in an interview - and now has trouble with ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outed her ex Dennis Quaid as an adulterer.
He foams - and hits back.
Late war of the roses for ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are now having an unpleasant argument - in public.
Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the marriage breakdown in an interview with US magazine InStyle last week: 'Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time and that was very painful.'
She said she only found out the extent of the fraud after the divorce.
The soul striptease was prompted by Ryan's publicity for her new film, "The Women," which tells the story of adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "It's outrageous," the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, that "Meg is rehashing and rewriting the history of our relationship."
He said it was also "regrettable" that their 16-year-old son Jack was once again "publicly reminded of the pain and upheaval that divorce entails for any child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and recently become a father to twins.
And so his remarks conclude with the swipe: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family who's doing great. '
Prices of airline tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights have even become up to 50 percent cheaper, according to a recent study.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again, according to a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and found a significant slump in the second quarter after a rise in prices in the first quarter.
After years of rising prices on the hotel market, overnight stays have already become cheaper in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most pronounced in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express blames the weak dollar, which has led to a "decline in the appetite of American tourists to travel."
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
The trend also showed an upward trend in air fares in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in fuel prices, passengers in economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and fuel-intensive long-haul flights even became up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, the prices of economy class tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in business and first class, the price changes were much smaller.
Prices in Germany plummeted even more than in other European countries:
Prices were up 11.9 per cent from January to March and down 23.6 per cent in the second quarter.
Prices on German domestic flights have even halved, according to the study.
The reason for the price drop is on the one hand the slowing economic growth, explains the company.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market is crumbling.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe, creates increased competitive pressure.
Signs of the tense situation were the cancellation of unprofitable routes by airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1-0
With one goal and simple methods, Hamburg SV becomes the championship leader.
At Borussia, Luhukay still fails to find a functioning team.
Kristoffer Klein and Marko Marin scored for the home side.
The man from Gladbach came into the game late and failed to hit the crossbar with a lifter.
His message was precisely formulated, it was persuasive.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," hissed Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the Hamburg Arena.
There was not much going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most were back in their seats.
Rieger was a physiotherapist for HSV for almost three decades, and he is held in higher esteem than many past players.
And so his request was listened to in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and gave a thumbs up in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
His command will have been similar: "Go ahead with gate two!"
Implementation has not been forthcoming.
"It wasn't all pretty to look at today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt, too, would have liked it to be "more relaxed."
The 1: 0 (1: 0) is due to the header goal of Mladen Petric (11th); and the fact that very weak people from Gladbach could not hurt the weak people from Hamburg.
"It was a filthy victory," Martin Jol summed it up.
Hamburger SV turns 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flash chart on the video wall, which showed their club to be top of the class.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to classify it," Marcell Jansen said.
He senses that the tabular interim record stands more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late arrivals - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalscorer Petric and the Bayern recruit Jansen - is slowly finding itself, but it is not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribbling," Jol insisted.
After the Vote Defeat
Fear is rife on Wall Street.
Initial news of the failure of the bailout sent the Dow Jones plunging 700 points at times.
It was the biggest one-day point loss in its history.
Later, the Dow regained some ground.
At around 8: 30 p.m., the world's most important stock market barometer was trading at 10,579 points, down a good five percent.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was down more than seven percent at 1,548 points.
The biggest losers at the time were Dow American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent, and Bank of America, which lost about 12 percent.
No title could be won.
Shares of bank Goldman Sachs fell nearly 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett took a stake in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the funds will be made available for the purchase of so-called bad mortgage securities.
However, the amount is not to be paid out in one go, but gradually.
In return, the state should receive stock warrants from financial companies, which could be cashed in if the share price developed accordingly, in order to reduce the burden on the state treasury.
Stocks in Europe and the US in a downward spiral
The billions in aid to banks in Europe and the USA do not resolve investors' doubts.
The share price of the major German bank Hypo Real Estate plummets and tears the Dax down.
The US Dow Jones index is losing ground despite the government's planned rescue of the financial market.
Spectacular share price losses by Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have sent the German stock index (Dax) into a deep decline.
Despite the rescue by the German government and private banks, the shares of the Munich real estate financier temporarily lost three quarters of their value, while Commerzbank fell by more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped well below the psychologically important 6000-point mark, trading down 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
Stock markets around the world fell to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with sharp losses.
Investors feared that the US government's $700 billion rescue package might not be enough to revive financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25 in the first hour of trading.
The US House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate vote could follow on October 1.
The other European stock markets also had only one direction: In London, the FTSE index initially fell 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index slipped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the benchmark Sensex index lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, to close at 12,595.75.
In the MDax, shares of Arcandor fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed for the 23 million new shares.
The retail and tourism group also announced that it would not be selling its shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences flight of spacecraft
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has puzzled researchers: Dark matter influences the speed of spacecraft during so-called swing-by manoeuvres.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity may not be entirely correct.
The "Ulysses" spacecraft flew through space for almost 18 years.
She is now at risk of cold death because of freezing fuel pipes.
A mysterious phenomenon - the swing-by anomaly - has been causing confusion among scientists for years.
Swing-by is a flight manoeuvre by spacecraft in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as Earth.
As a result, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, as did the solar probe Ulysses.
What has puzzled the researchers for years, however, is that the missiles do not behave 100 percent as one would expect under the time-honored law of gravity.
In fact, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They christened it swing-by-anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by the curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study remains a firm believer that Einstein was not wrong, and is trying to explain the swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"The anomaly could be caused by dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for around ten years.
It obviously emanates an attraction, the effect of which can be observed on other celestial bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, i.e. it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially not visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, dark matter accounts for a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists abducted in Egypt are to be released, the Italian Foreign Minister has confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom.
Six hostage takers are believed to have been killed in a shootout before their release.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Ransom negotiations are already under way.
Again and again, Germans are targeted by kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists abducted in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arabic TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media in agreement.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports by the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed.
We are checking her health, "Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian woman as well as their eight Egyptian companions are safe and well, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already said to be on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear: According to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army unexpectedly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom, "the official said.
He said it was "just a matter of taking the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday shot dead six of the kidnappers and detained two of them in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper El Masri El Jom, citing a German mediator, reported that the release of the hostages was being delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Stepfather abuse 'led to suicide'
Years of abuse by her stepfather led to a woman committing suicide, a court has been told.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after admitting eight counts of sexual abuse.
The court in Truro heard he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: 'I feel responsible for her death.'
The court heard that Ms Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, aged 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and blindfolded her before performing sexual acts while her mother was away working in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court heard that Ms Randle, who worked as a volunteer for the National Trust for much of her time, was haunted by the abuse she was subjected to twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said Ms Randle, who had been a keen surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "given up her life."
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead at their Plymouth home.
She is believed to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended: 'I used to tie her up and blindfold her.'
'I didn't sexually coerce her.
I feel responsible for her death. "
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: 'You are an extremely strange fetishist and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially as she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Even worse is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if she had not done so. "
He added: 'I note the impact Stephanie's father and mother have had on their daughter over the years.
Otherwise she would clearly have been a promising, successful and happy young woman. "
Officials responsible for lost data to be charged
The BBC has learnt that the Cabinet Office official who lost top-secret documents on a train in June will be charged under the Public Security Act.
The man was seconded by the Ministry of Defence when he lost two highly confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the action had come as a surprise to many in Whitehall.
He said: 'You would have thought it would be dealt with internally at the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet.'
The employee, whose name cannot be disclosed, will be charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause dealing with the secure storage of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer be prosecuted by the Metropolitan Police for the highly sensitive nature of his work on the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he published contained classified assessments of al-Qaida and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his home to a secret location.
Housing societies face B & B costs
British housing associations could face costs of more than ¬£80 million after bailing out Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The Government has set aside ¬£14billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley's 2.6million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies receiving money from investors, including the 59 building societies.
Adrian Coles, chief executive of the Association of Housing Associations (BSA), said it was "intolerable" that the societies and their members would have to pay.
The $14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are repaid.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is credited each year to the 700 financial firms that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing associations are included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently... are now being called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies collectively would have to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will be ¬£450 million in 2009.
This means the companies will have to raise ¬£81 million for the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, chief executive of the Association of Housing Associations, told the BBC he believed it was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that behaved prudently during the housing boom are now being called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since records began in 1945.
'We'll be looking at all aspects of this over the next few weeks to see what alternatives are there to protect housing associations and their members from potentially significant costs. '
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
Interest is due for a full year in 2010, and that could be nearly double.
As building societies are mutually exclusive, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk will be five pence a litre more expensive
People on Jersey face having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence a litre from Monday.
It is the second price rise this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after research by a consultancy firm.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Prior to the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Former Bangladeshi prime minister denied bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a bail application from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defense lawyers said the court denied bail on charges of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several pending corruption charges against her.
Sheikh Hasina's longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-backed transitional government grant her full freedom first.
Correspondents say that although she was granted a stay of detention to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear on her release whether she will be able to remain at large when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court's decision.
"The high court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says she does not need to be granted bail as she is already on parole abroad to be treated abroad," her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
We're going to file an appeal with the high court. '
Her lawyers say she needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, an Awami Alliance party chairman said on Sunday.
She was jailed last year after the army-backed interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against them.
Fears for the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the latest anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated due to Taliban-related violence, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations launched a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was despite a promise by the Taliban not to attack or impede the thousands of vaccination workers.
BSkyB loses lawsuit in ITV case
BSkyB has lost its appeal against the Competition Commission's decision to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster ITV.
The Court of Competition has ordered BSkyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission previously claimed that BSkyB's stake distorts competition and allows it to have an unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stake in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition and Markets Authority reported that BSkyB's purchase of ITV raised doubts about ITV's independence, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom, the communications regulator, have all spoken out against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the pressure to reduce its stake in ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, especially since BSkyB had announced that it would give up its voting rights.
New probe into U.S. attorney's affair
The US Attorney General has appointed a special investigator to look into the dismissal of the nine US prosecutors in 2006.
The move followed a report by the Justice Department's inspector general criticizing the actions of administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Investigator Nora Dannehy is now expected to determine whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to investigators to obstruct justice.
Serious allegations, including criminal conduct, have not been fully investigated or resolved, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special investigator with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Justice Department removed nine U.S. prosecutors from their posts in December 2006.
At the time, the department argued that prosecutors were fired because of poor work performance.
However, it was later established that the sacked prosecutors had been judged no worse than many of their colleagues, prompting many observers to consider the dismissals politically motivated.
Some of those prosecutors have been involved in prosecuting senior Republican members of Congress, while others have refused to investigate allegations of Democratic voter fraud.
U.S. prosecutors are tasked with investigating and prosecuting cases for the government.
They can be dismissed at any time, but they must not be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, came under fire for the firings and ultimately resigned.
A number of Justice Department officials have also quit.
The inspector general's report was particularly critical of Gonzales' role, saying he bore "primary responsibility" for the firings, "abandoned" his leadership role and showed "extraordinary disinterest" in the process.
Other officials, including former top Bush adviser Karl Rove, have been criticized for failing to cooperate with investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honoured
Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honoured at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will accept his special golden award at the ceremony in London next week, said he was honoured to be recognised.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track to Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
Coldplay are leading the nominations for this year's awards, having been shortlisted in four categories.
Q Magazine editor-in-chief Paul Rees said there were some songs that transcended such subjects as time and genre, and "Bat Out Of Hell" was certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a powerful voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song went on sale in the UK as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, including an operation in 2003 for an irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel concerts due to acute laryngitis.
It was later revealed that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon for sale
New York City has thousands of major thoroughfares, avenues, side streets and other bypasses, some famous and others convenient.
Still, even experienced taxi drivers and longtime locals find it hard to tell where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs north from First Street between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used thoroughfare.
There are also no street signs.
It is virtually impossible to find them on a standard road map.
Nevertheless, this street has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer that has recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to repave Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the longtime neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short alley simply because it is one of the remnants of the block's past.
But the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of residential buildings and the street, has no interest in preserving them.
During a meeting of the council's land use committee this month, representatives of the city council and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal for the developer to purchase the road.
Still, the committee favors keeping the road in the city's hands, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, said Susan Stetzer, the county supervisor on the council.
"Very little space has remained in the city's possession and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced plans to repave the small street and install seats, including a caf√©, to which the company plans to lease space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was first made public during this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said the company wanted to use the road but did not necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this dilapidated alley and turn it into a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Department of Buildings Protection, said it was actually the city's desire to sell the street and stressed that the department's job was to develop the properties rather than manage them.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood, The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historic feel.
Some believe that the street got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB music club, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened to Extra Place, and the street is probably best known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones "album" Rocket to Russia. "
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
The street was full of scrap metal, rags and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public land, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have hailed Extra Place as a rarity - a virtually unchanged sliver of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitter Nostalgic Look at the Dying City"), has published a portion of the conversation in the city's history about Extra Place that appeared in The New Yorker magazine in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small, narrow cul-de-sac that remains dark even during the day, marked by the rusted metal doors of warehouses, locked windows and weeklong newspapers flying past gutters."
With a few exceptions, the street has looked exactly like this on a recent evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, which now houses a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti could be seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of discarded newspapers.
Some passersby said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested the street could be polished up a bit.
Fields added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the appeal of the street in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
Bilingual education debate: Education in an English-speaking environment
In this issue of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates "positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a senior research fellow in California studies and senior director in the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Addressing Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a case in point.
Obama's campaign mentions that "African-American and Hispanic students are less likely to successfully complete school than white students" - which is true.
To close the achievement gap, Obama's education plan specifically recommends a bilingual transition period in education for those who first learn English.
Still, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching languages other than English, contradicts his interest in narrowing the gap in school achievement.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in east Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of pupils, many of whom have only recently arrived in the country, are learning English.
Yet in 2008, an astonishing 100 per cent of fourth-graders passed the state exam at a good level in maths.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of the children from the fourth grade were rated as good in the English exam.
This astonishing success has been achieved by methods other than those favored by Obama.
Sixth Street School focuses on verification and practice, on constant control of knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
The school also practices the approach of educating in an English-speaking environment, which is exactly what Obama should be mindful of, said Principal Linda Mikels.
This approach emphasizes the almost exclusive use of the English language in specialized instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico. Twelve months later, one would enter the classroom and be unrecognizable.
"It works," she noted, "it works for us."
Would Obama use a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with large percentages of Latino and other English-learning students?
The school's performance would make the answer to that question easy, but education policy positions within his own party (the National Education Associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions about Obama's answer uncertain.
While he agrees with the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about "English-only" legislation.
Instead, he said, "you should make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the achievement gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work, rather than despise and trivialize them.
Oil price falls on renewed fears for economy
The price of oil fell sharply on Monday on fears that even America's financial rescue plan might not be enough to revive the economy.
Crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by both the financial turmoil on Wall Street and powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 a barrel in July, prices have fallen to nearly $90 a barrel this month, only to rise again as a result of huge uncertainty in financial markets.
Investors showed renewed concern on Monday, even though congressional officials said they had agreed over the weekend on a rescue plan that would be the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by renewed concerns that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest chapter in the growing crisis, Citigroup is to buy Wachovia Corporation's banking operations, according to a government announcement on Monday.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it appeared to have failed to revive market sentiment.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to investors that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates had become extremely uncertain.
We believe the goods markets will also be affected.
"From a commodity market perspective, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading globally, particularly to China."
The Bank's analysts have revised down their expectations for oil consumption due to weak economic growth in the coming year, and lowered their forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20%.
Team record set by series in second quarter
Central defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all after wearing a Jets jersey more often than anyone in the last eight-and-a-half years.
Then, on Sunday, he watched the second quarter in which the Jets turned an inconclusive game into a triumph.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
After a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals that suited the bad weather, the second quarter began.
But when quarterback Brett Favre's pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start to an afternoon where their evolving collaboration took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the quarter, one as an outside defender and the other with 10 seconds left in the half.
"I didn't put too much effort into it," Coles says of the passes that went to Coles.
'He's a super player.
Our vote was right, no matter what people think. "
While Favre and Cole played catch, the defense picked quarterback Kurt Warner apart.
Winger Darrelle Revis intercepted a fumble and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith caught another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced on Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinal had the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets reclaimed the ball and Jay Feely converted a 20-yard shot for a 34-0 lead.
That was the most points the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the Jets "coach, replied," The second quarter or the third quarter? "
Answering both questions, as the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without scoring a single, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short time. "
Rested Gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has once again shown why some consider him the best long-distance runner of all time, after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to complete the distance of 42.2 kilometres in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
By winning on the flat course in 2: 03: 59 Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2: 04: 26 by 27 seconds, which he achieved in Berlin last year.
Gebrselassie, 35, set his 26th world record in his multi-faceted career, in which he has won at least one world title or set a world record in every distance from one kilometre to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon for fear, perhaps exaggerated in retrospect, that air pollution might worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he has signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - with sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya switched to long distances, the marathon record time has fallen by more than 2 minutes in the last 10 years, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with a result of 2: 06: 05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and could not train for a week.
Obviously he came back refreshed and not rusty after the break.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I resumed training a week ago and had some concerns today, but in the end it was all great. "
He has been criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - for orchestrating his races excessively, generally shunning many of the world's best marathon stars, relying too much on race leaders as if it were a track race, and putting world records ahead of competition.
But that criticism does little harm to Gebrselassie's greatness as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the middle of the course in 1: 02: 04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pace-setters slowed.
With just over three miles to go, Gebrselassie made his final attempt to break away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2: 05: 36, improving his personal best by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2: 07: 48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now a German, completed a remarkable year by posting the seventh fastest time of all time with 2: 19: 19.
Paul Radcliff of Great Britain holds the world record of 2: 15: 25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2: 24: 14.
She missed the Beijing Games because of what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and improve her personal best by five minutes in her third marathon.
She cleverly planned her run by letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners break away, but overtook them after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2: 21: 31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2: 25: 01.
The pride and hardships in the lives of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Tucked away among the sprawl of Orlando theme parks, a few miles from the glitzy, noisy and gigantic hustle and bustle, lies a quiet town where the pride and complications of African-American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first all-black city in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is not as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Nowadays it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
Yet the city it describes - and which made it a tourist destination by including it in the Florida Guide, produced by the Federal Writers Project during the Depression - is, in many ways, a very special place.
Eatonville is as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what he's missing."
Even now, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open conversation about race relations, many here are still tired of being watched by outsiders.
"We're very attentive to how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, a city resident by birth and a parishioner at the city's oldest church.
It's got to be right. '
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historic example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 inhabitants where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a literary stronghold and, on the other, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural South, which has its roots in American slavery.
Unsurprisingly, residents here are both proud and wary.
And the concerns about Eatonville's image really began with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1973).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, which is just off Route 77, a road that leads through the often-forgotten center of Florida, into the sites of black history and human drama.
Cheeky as Oscar in both real life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private matters.
"Across the street to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-and-white painted modern school, with its manicured gardens and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always takes care of, even though he can barely read and write."
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband, writing that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever-fits-the-hour-room."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a guidebook.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls that Hurston immortalized, quoting the men who sang songs about her beauty that were full of sexual innuendo.
She added: 'Some people didn't like it.'
Hurtson is still remembered here as a feisty eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston came to town, she did so mostly without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants, in a city that even today has something to do with its venerable attire.
According to Mr Franklin, most residents were intrigued, while many despised her.
"People were always happy to see Zora," Mr Franklin said.
But "she never stayed too long," he added, swaying in his chair on a rear terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960 she was poor and her books were out of print.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary of Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she lived.
In Eatonville, there was no big memorial service, no large-scale public readings.
"I don't think they understood their contribution to the world or their legacy in the slightest," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
The turning point came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to build a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main street of the community.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came as Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Compulsory integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred into the community.
"At that time a bunch of white boys would often come and throw oranges and stuff at people sitting on the sidelines," Mr Franklin said.
"There was even once a woman who was killed in the process.
They threw a watermelon out of the car. "
In a 1955 letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's call to force integration, calling its decision in the Brown v. Board case "insulting rather than respectful of my race."
Residents now say that while the repeal of segregation was positive in some respects, it weakened Eatonville's cohesion and the self-esteem of its youth.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning and you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group Protecting the Eatonville Community.
This could be maintained, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"They didn't hug his white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural divide," Ms. Nathiri said.
However, civil rights have helped to make room for more Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who defy prejudice, as she did, with positive self-awareness and statements such as: "How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand it. '
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker made her way to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight to revive her fame.
Five years later, a highly acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway was on bookshelves, making it part of the American literary canon once again.
The highway project came at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the public spotlight.
And this time Hurston's old neighbours saw her as a saviour.
The community began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could do with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans turned up for the inaugural event two years later, and many return every January for the celebration.
A few years later, the district abandoned its road plans.
"The plans for a five-lane highway enlivened the city, accelerated it at top speed, aroused real civic pride," Ms. Nathiri said.
Ms Boyd put it a little more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city.
More and more people came, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending church here since 1993, and locals began to reassess the past.
Eatonville was added to the statewide Historic Register in 1998.
A new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Nowadays, Eatonville remains a peculiarity in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Nowadays it is 90% black.)
Outsiders in search of Eatonville's story and its meaning are often still treated with caution.
Most interviews require prior permission, and certain things - such as the mural of Eatonville's oldest church painted by a white man depicting black men working in the fields - may not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a courageous, confident teacher with a penchant for dark reds, still worry that their gated community is misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time as the Hurston Festival grew, a heightened degree of homeland pride was born.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville the way Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better, and just as proud, creative and hard-working, silly and mixed as any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city government or the police, who he says might need some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who just drive through here will think," Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others, "Alondra Kenon said the other day on a Sunday after church.
'But when you actually stop and look at its history for a moment, it's a very beautiful city. '
Here in New York, people are fluent in financial Latin.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newsstands and the huge television screens in Times Square, they would not even notice that they were in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that above their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have a monopoly in New York, there is the worst horror day of the day since the stock market crashed in 1929.
Suppliers are still pushing metal tea trolleys along sidewalks with loud clatters, carrying trays loaded with muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latinos still shuffle between apartments, like human pack animals laden with about 50 ironed T-shirts hanging from a yoke-like pole on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting for their breakfast bagel at food stalls on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi between 4pm and 7pm on a weekday.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon, when, amid all the doomsday talk, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had decided to schedule my mandatory walk on the quiet late afternoon at my JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about 20 people queuing up.
Not at the cash counters to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service counter where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists for directions to the Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them, I later learned from Starr, my "licensed personal bank clerk," were queuing for the same reason I was queuing.
Unlike me, however, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places they commuted from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called thrifts (a bit like building societies), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that have branches only in one state, and say they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks quietly went bust.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went into receivership, and when New Yorkers drove home over the weekend last Friday, Wachovia, another bank that owns $440 billion in savings, was looking for a buyer to save.
Fearing another collapse, the clerks and store clerks who lined up before me took their cash to a bank seen as a safe haven, a bank responsible for most of Wall Street's bailout purchases.
Ordinary New Yorkers have been learning fluent financial Latin in recent weeks.
A woman on the phone to my local supermarket in China referred with such familiarity to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its emaciated-looking chief executive Dick Fuld, as if she were railing against a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my block of flats, has strayed from our usual talking points about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after visiting the bank.
'I've changed, I'm not taking any more risks. '
Muslim graves desecrated during right-wing slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing member of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 to represent the organisation Cities Against Islamisation.
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs depicting a mosque, crossed out with a red line.
Police have accused far-right extremists of desecrating graves in a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend that far-right parties made significant gains in the country's parliamentary election.
During the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely damaged in what police said was an organized operation.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as David Stern on some of the graves, but detectives believe this is an attempt to mask the motive of the extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the burial desecration, which took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan draws to a close.
At the same time, Austria is facing a round of soul-searching after the country slipped to the right in yesterday's general election.
The FP√ñ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties that won nearly 30% of the vote, campaigned for a strict anti-immigrant law, and some of their slogans were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the Freedom Party (FP√ñ), which won 18% of the vote, called for a ban on headscarves and burqas, and even made known his aversion to foods commonly associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the building of mosques and minarets, arguing that these are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the election, indicating that the far right is the strongest political bloc in the country, suggest that this new development is based on young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain by a court.
Judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed authorities he was planning to travel to Spain via France.
Kent Police were granted an overseas travel ban last Thursday after presenting evidence to magistrates about Glitter's criminal record for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent but was represented by law firm Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the tribunal said: 'On Thursday 25 September Kent Police applied to Ashford Magistrates' Court for permission to prevent Mr Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd wasn't there in person. '
According to the Sex Offenders Register, Glitter, 64, had informed authorities he was planning to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his scheduled departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a prison sentence of 5 years.
Kent Police said it would not discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokeswoman for Kent Police said: 'Kent Police will do whatever is necessary to protect children in this country and abroad.'
'We think it's easier to monitor someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system in place to effectively prevent any potential risks. '
"It is the number one concern of Kent Police to protect Kent residents and we work closely with them to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders across the country to minimise any risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to catch a flight to London.
But he said he was not feeling well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through passport control and after some back and forth he flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted he return to the UK.
Last but not least, he arrived at Heathrow's Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge Magistrates' Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully applied for permission to require him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been jailed for four months in the UK in 1999 for possessing child abuse images.
The Home Office said Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, was reassured and satisfied that Glitter had been prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
'I meet the master backstage to capture his character, 'said the photographer.
No heels, no frills, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who forgo concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to achieve a relaxed appearance as a woman or a man.


I look into private life, into those moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find the gesture typical of the personality, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, which are worried because they will not enter the stage.
In his project 'Flamenco-people' the German photographer G√ºnter Bauer depicts the theatricality of some of the productions on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. On this side he was still little known to the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the Flamenco Photography Month program, 'reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is growing day by day,' the artist explains, making it clear that 'flamenco people' can be 'any person, but when looking at the photos, the viewer notices that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
Ordinary people in the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness and joy on stage and thus move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you do not have to take photos on stage.
Her personality and character is in her heart.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with the camera. '
Bauer, inspired by the Cante de las Minas festival, set out on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the available material, images were created that are reminiscent of classical photography.
The use of different stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the painting, giving the painting modernity and the idea of how the peasant understands flamenco: 'music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
It is not just the dance, the singing or the instrumental play per se, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of listening, of being, is and has been the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fot√≥mata.
Famous flamenco personalities such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the nearly seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon be published as a book with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as' Portraits of the Veterans of Sports' ('SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the project 'Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer admits: 'I like to photograph people, to get to know them and to put myself in their state of life, be it for a short moment or for a long time.
In the field of photography, I think that portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You meet or meet people you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a picture.
Apart from those circumstances, as a photographer, I'm always trying to make my ideas come true. '
The collection of contemporary flamenco portraits entitled 'Flamenco People' is on display in the Gallery of El Fot√≥mata, located in the street called la calle de la Mata, which runs parallel to la Alameda de H√©rcules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he is writing is' a foolhardy thing '.
He does not yet know where the plot of the novel takes place or what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa persistently tries to advance the project he is currently working on, a novel starring Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon.
Yesterday, speaking at the Hay Festival in London, the Nobel Prize-winning author admitted the project he is working on is' foolhardy 'and' everything points to him not having to write the novel '.
"If I was level-headed, I wouldn't have done it, but I will and I hope to finish the novel one day," he concluded his participation in the festival, where ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Over the four days, he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of 'La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most prominent personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize and was voted by most attendees, has been compared to the old version of 'Our Mutual Friend' and can be seen at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by F√©lix Romeo and realized that he had an audience in front of him who realized that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, did not have enough time to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature arose out of "extraordinary adventurous spirit," from "joy of reading" and from "wanting to experience more than before"; how he writes and "maintains discipline" to supplement "the lack of inspiration," his intensive work with documentaries, numerous corrections and revisions that he makes; how Faulkner, V√≠ctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and which "memory pictures" are the basis for his stories.
The Hispano-American novelist acknowledged that there is' no way 'to measure and how to know if books change lives,' but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience, 'stressed Vargas Llosa, who claims that it' produces effects' and 'brings people even more apart', so I asked the writers' not to give in to lightness' and 'take responsibility' for his vocation.
The weather did not play a part in the festival in Pozoblanco: bullfighting festivals were partially cancelled.
After the announced bullfighters noticed that the ground of the square was in bad condition, the bullfighting festival, which was supposed to conclude the festival in Pozoblanco, was postponed until yesterday morning.
Thus, with the agreement of Ferm√≠n Boh√≥rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hern√°ndez, the organizer decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
As a result, the festival was suspended due to the unstable weather, which meant that two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, which is why the second planned bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The group of matadors consisted of Jos√© Luis Moreno, Curro D√≠as and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and triumphed after leaving the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening Alejandro Talavante hit two horns and one ear of the bull, which he had succeeded more by galloping than by his bullfighting skills.
Even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without glory.
After fighting so poorly, much of the crowd responded with boos during his second fight.
In √Ålava, two people tried to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: Five minutes to ten.
Traffic control in Ertzaintza, in the municipality of Armi√±on (√Ålava).
Two police officers told the drivers of the car to stop and they fled.
It looked as if they would not have to stop with a load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
Police pursued them and arrested one of the drivers, a 28-year-old man known as A. A. J., the Basque State Interior Ministry said.
The person arrested has been charged with drug trafficking and falsifying official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police officers of the √Ålava region had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and were passing through the municipal area of Armi√±on.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control, and the driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to evade control.
The police started the pursuit until after a few kilometers the car stopped at the edge of the road. At that moment the drivers got out of the car and fled along a country road into a forest area.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza finally caught up with one of them. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2.178 kilograms of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front of the car was loaded with bunches of hashish, which were later taken to other police stations for detailed laboratory analysis and weighing of the bunches.
Officers also found that the number plate was' double ', meaning it did not match the number plate given on the vehicle documents, leading to an additional arrest for forgery of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza are continuing the investigation in order to arrest the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, managed to flee, but also to establish the origin of the seized drugs.
The arrested 28-year-old A. A. J. was taken to a police station for questioning and will be brought before the custody judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear has been arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, best known for playing Amanda from the series "Melrose Place," was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
A witness witnessed her trying to get out of her parking space in Montecito in a rather strange way, a spokesperson for the California Department of Transportation told People magazine.
The witness detailed that Locklear 'pressed the accelerator pedal and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forwards out of the parking space, and as she drove backwards she grabbed her sunglasses a few times.'
A little later, the witness, who probably didn't recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear stop in a nearby street and get out of the car.
The witness was the one who alerted the emergency services because she was' afraid for Locklear's life '.
When the police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which was parked across the road blocking traffic.
seemed disorientated, 'so the police took her to a special drug and alcohol centre to take a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress appeared cooperative and excessive drinking was ruled out from the first moment. 'Based on the officers' initial observations, we believe Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug, 'the spokesman said.
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance, which cannot be determined, and taken to a local remand centre about 7pm.
Two months ago, Locklaer was discharged from the Arizona clinic where she was being treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Confederation of the United Left take responsibility for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and member of the United Left, assured today that the Regional Association for Education will be the one to make the decision in the case of Francisco Manuel Silva, former Councillor for Youth and Sport of the Seville City Hall, who resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
'In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one that has to take responsibility for this, 'Llamazares pointed out the approach the party must take towards the one who currently sits on the Seville municipal council as a councillor.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible investigations of rule violations that Silva may have initiated: 'The VL has always insisted that such cases receive the maximum transparency'.
Regarding this issue, he stressed that education has' a strict ethical code for all public offices'.
'Sangre de mayo ': Garci's Book of Heroes
Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' by Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s, Jos√© Luis Carci presents in 'Sangre de mayo' the revised version of the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French. It is an admirable film in filmography, with an investment of about 15 million euros for the shooting.
In this way, the cinematographer has tried to "represent a lot of personalities and social analysis," which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Guti√©rrez and Paula Echevarr√≠a at the beginning of a long list of actors.
'Sangre de mayo 'with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be shown in cinemas this Friday and later on the Telemadrid channel as a four-hour miniseries.
Jos√© Luis Garci, a great fan of Gald√≥s literature, affirms that thanks to this work, his "childhood dream" has come true, thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him from the Autonomous Community of Madrid to make a film commemorating the second centenary in Madrid on 2 November. Particularly because the story is based on Episodios Nacionales, he accepted the commission.
The total contribution of 15 million provided by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for filming offers Garci, he added, a 'unique opportunity' to portray, with the help of decorations and appropriate clothing, the image of 'confused Spain, which chose the wrong leader for the struggle because the people had been lagged behind by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII'.
However, the cinematographer regrets that it was not possible to count on funding like for 'Alatriste' or 'Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as much as for 'Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valc√°rcel, with whom Garci worked almost all his career, could not be shot.
For this reason, Garci, who was also the film director in 'Volver a empezar', participated through his usual way of working: he stood on stage with the actors with whom you have to rehearse first before you start shooting, and for those who had not done a casting, he appeared 'humbling' and giving respect, 'part of the job of the film director is to help in the theatre and in the cinema, to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which you work'.
Many of the actors he encounters in 'Sangre de mayo' have to repeat themselves in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rell√°n, Carlos Larra√±aga or Fernando Guill√©n Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar nominee in four nominations (of which he has won one), affirms that none of the three candidates representing Spain at the Academy of Hollywood this year represent a young generation of Spanish filmography, neither 'Sangre de mayo', 'Siete mesas de billar franc√©s' nor, finally, the selected film 'Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
'In the beginning you think that you are working for the offspring, later you realize that it is only for prosperity, and now you are satisfied when you have produced another film, 'explains Garci after more than 30 years in the profession.
Isabel Bay√≥n recalls the memory of the dancer from Sevilla T√≥rtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen T√≥rtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Floren√ß T√≥rtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalucian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of women, like Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian and campaigned for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free feminine movement.
Isabel Bay√≥n was fascinated by the life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between the wars.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role, which I thought was impossible, 'he said.
'We're not trying to talk about her life, we're trying to keep her spirit, 'the flamenco dancer said.
Their dance basics helped me a lot in flamenco.
For example, 'The Dance of the Butterfly' seemed to me like Guajira, or 'The Dance of the Serpent' like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I was told that my dancing was also in this aesthetic realm, 'she claims.
The production counts on two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in 'La puerta abierta'; and with flamenco master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with one of her ex-pupils.
'Matilde plays T√≥rtola, he's a very mature character.
I'm happy because she agreed to be part of my work and I'm very honoured. '
The production also includes musical composition and the guitarists Jes√∫s Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the vocals of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Mor√≥n; with the percussion of El P√°jaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra J√∫arez, who 'takes on the role of accompanying the artists who were divas with whom he falls in love again and again'.
This work also tells in a certain way of the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
'I wanted to remind her because I think she is one of those women who have a huge impact on a particular era and whose work nobody appreciates any more and therefore even less, 'Bay√≥n says.
The performance takes place today at 20: 30 in the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the book 'Diario de un poeta reci√©n casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of 'Diario de un poeta reci√©n casado' at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez married Zenobia in 1916, provides an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council of Culture to celebrate the 'Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ram√≥n' (2006-2008), with the aim of commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the awarding of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of their deaths.
Thus, 'the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ram√≥n' concludes with the new edition of this work, with the international congress taking place in New York, with the restoration of the House-Museum of Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez-Zenobia and with the traveling exhibition 'Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez:' Aquel chopo de luz ', which opened in May and, after having been in various places in Andalusia, has now reached New York and will be presented during the international congress.
The Andalusian Council of Culture has also received eight hundred copies of 'Diario de un poeta reci√©n casado', edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo P√©rez-Enciso, with the aim of promoting the person and work of the Andalusian world poet.
The US is hard to imagine without Paul Newman
'Sometimes God creates perfect personalities, 'he said.
Paul Newman was one of them. '
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'Sensational Reporter', and from the prevailing notion of American cinema at the time, which was abandoned, from all over America until Newman came up with his inspiring idea and followed it.
Look how much it cost her to award him the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very ill.
Still, it was a big blow for everyone.
'What you sometimes feel is so much more than an expression, and now I've lost a great friend, 'Robert Redford said tearfully,' my life and my country have been the greatest threats of my life. '
No one was afraid to ridicule or exaggerate.
As the 'father' of cinema and fatherland, he died at a sad moment when there is fear of terrorists and a market collapse, when the depressed self-esteem of Americans is searching hopelessly for reasons to regain dignity.
If, in these tough times, there are few people to admire without virtue, you don't necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone, he embodied a quasi-platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered losses and profits, from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs, founded in honor of his son from his first marriage, who died of an overdose, to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
It is all a gift to the country, where it has struggled to assert itself against a lethal food culture.
A broad wave of astonishment is sweeping Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not just one person died, but the whole era.
Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winner, said working with Newman was nothing more or less than the apex of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
'The greatest of us all has left us, 'confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who now dares to live the way Paul Newman lived: high standards of probity, a responsible private life, away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there is someone who is trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful, although there were certainly many opportunities not to be.
'Why would I eat a hamburger in the street when I have fillet at home? 'he often joked.
In heaven, he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinions as his fans, which is not strictly common in America.
'Of all the great roles he played, none was more proud than that of his loyal spouse, loving father, caring grandfather and philanthropist, 'they say.
For the Olympics, the streets of Madrid are poor.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic events in Madrid, after the failure of 2012, but it may be 2016.
But I wonder: 'Are we prepared for this?'
Yes, we are following the example of the old roads, I say that it is not true!
It was called the perfect street, and in my judgement, it was the worst street with all the trimmings there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if you took into account the assessment and I could check it, that would clearly not have got through.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the tickethole, which allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem too bad to me, but if they let you do it, they should give you everything (including a chip to avoid traffic jams).
Well, it doesn't.
Here they just let you get the ticket (the first nonsense consisting of going there just because of that) and (after an endless queue) there's the surprise! The T-shirt was only available in size 'S' (a second nonsense, because I need size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that, after the crisis, it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
Well, stuff like this is a trifle compared to the days on the road.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave your backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as was to be expected, the road started and we did not leave our backpacks in front of it, even if we had succeeded once, but it would be more difficult to retrieve them.
In addition, during that 40-minute wait, it looked like rain, so there was a temptation to organize a popular uprising and raid the house.
I think that tomorrow some 500 people will certainly have pneumonia and some like me will not even show up in time for the classification because of the chip I got, I can imagine that the outcome has been mislabelled.
Of course, if I was asked for a perfect street, this street would never come to mind.
So I think we will dream for a long time of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference' hosted by MIT, Microsoft presented the advancement of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or, in Microsoft's case, a route planner to move around the company's campus), which respects what it hears during conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this' receptionist 'can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, can listen and understand the key words of their conversation.
It can also arrange those present into the groups after the talks.
In the presentation video, 'the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not part of the group that is talking to her, nor is he a company employee.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and replies that they will listen soon.
All without the blue screenshot

That is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, such as the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week, there was very superficial talk about Microsoft's change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and will not have as many included programs.
Steve Ballmer stated that if the computers were equipped with the essentials, instead of filling them with commercial garbage, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will only be for the few.
Everything is just a statement, considering that Microsoft added one or two features and 'extras' in versions of Windows.
The change of direction is worthwhile
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, as is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the net, it was part of the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Skillfully, many pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared with the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's true.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of its' death ', not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of that idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system each time, but more to the web browser.
The computer only starts to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time browsing than around the 'windows'.
What is the purpose of half of the existing applications in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft's interest is more in integrating its online services, which may eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need it, without a doubt. I will give a small example.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the soft drinks machine: "Your search. Our future." It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google used for Internet searches.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not be published at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, or even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio wore it in Edward Zwick's' Blood Diamond ', as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's' The Godfather '.
If we begin to list the countless star performances, we can go back to the image of a very strong man with a pointed beard, who had lifted heavyweights in a travelling circus.
Basically, this is a typically masculine cotton T-shirt, sleeveless and fitted.
English speakers call it 'tank', but Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands.
Firstly, because of his great name, even though she is called 'Marcel' in the close circle. Legend has it that the origin of the name is connected with sports and comes from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
"La Marcel" towers over everyone for its excellent cotton, its distinctive unisex cut and is distinguished by a small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that these t-shirts have as a detail around the neck.
And beware, the Belgian company does not only focus on the production of 'tanks'.
They also have college sweatshirts, boxers retro, cardigans and cashmere, cotton pants, t-shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They are very sexy.
'I want to be a young mum, I'm not worried about the contest'
Her great demeanour with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
M√≥nica Cruz is petite, but full of zest for life.
The Gruz siblings are currently taking their new career in fashion very seriously.
This means a lot more to M√≥nica than it does to some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation intact.
She was in Paris promoting the company Mango, relocating there and also doing the presentation of the most important awards in fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and shy, winner on short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn / winter season that my sister Pen√©lope and I designed for Mango, I also attended the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and attended the dinner in honor of Valentino.
It's a very intense job, which is exciting at the same time.
Working for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season of Mango?
My sister and I are both fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to walk through a city and watch women how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, that's what I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything comes together in one and these areas have a lot in common.
Ever since I was little, I have been fascinated by clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to rummage through my aunt's wardrobe and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to a theme park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real acting role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, a lot of respect for the costume designers and their professionalism.
Recently you turned 30, didn't you fall into a crisis?
Oh, what.
I feel better than ever, as a thirty-year-old I feel good.
I think the woman is maturing, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I've been doing the things I've wanted to do since I was little and it's given me a lot of inner joy.
So, do you think about becoming a mother, or not?
I have known for a long time that I am going to be a mother because my body demands it and I also want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not worried.
I will give my child great happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
As far as cinematography is concerned, keep in mind the work you took part in and which was shot last year.
That is exactly how it is and I very much want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want everything at once, which of course cannot be immediate.
I very much hope that 'La √∫ltima hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them
A few days ago you appeared on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell, is that true?
It's fine, don't say anything like that.
It's not that I went on the catwalk to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, simply called me and invited me to London to take part in a parade for her organisation's Women for a Better World charity event and the clothes we are showing. I know that two pieces of clothing from our collection have been auctioned off for Mango to raise money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
Many things are told about her. I, as the one who knows her, would tell you that they are not true.
Nevertheless, I will support this good cause in which she is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this generous cause, but if she comes and asks me to do a handstand, I will do it, too.
In order to support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
Motorists who can fall behind because of their alcohol levels will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who has had three official penalties for drink driving, install this system in his car, which forbids him to start the car when drunk. If he is drunk, the car does not start.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the Attorney General's report, which she says is a pilot project that will last a year.
The purpose is to resocialize the driver, which is why he gets a course in re-education of traffic behavior.
In addition to the General Prosecutor's Office, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute of Automobile Safety will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of motorists who were reported more than once for driving under the influence of alcohol put themselves back behind the wheel.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents car start if the driver has taken a breathalyzer test; or if an alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than permitted.
It costs more than EUR 1 000 and the costs are borne by the person who imposes the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the USA in 2007 has shown that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of rule violations in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate its implementation, a legal reform can be implemented in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the Basic Law, which is necessary for the prosecution process, is called for.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish markets, in any store, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Tomorrow, of all days, the Chamber of Deputies will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
The Spanish Air Force plane carrying the Prince and Princess of Asturias landed next to the presidential hangar at Benito Ju√°rez de M√©xico DF airport with British punctuality at 17: 40, the time scheduled for the programme.
The sun went down, but its rays still forced her to use her hand as an umbrella to see the royal couple getting off the plane.
Right on the gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours earlier, I had asked a taxi driver in the street if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalise the official trip.
- Ah, very good, so you can't take people with you at the airport at this time.She is from here or thereabouts
No, she is Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
-Oh, very good
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are many who wait in the airport hangar and on the red carpet, including 27 Marines who deliver salvos of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hair blown by the wind, no ordinary peep-toes, perhaps informed that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers waiting for the official entourage.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television waits for them, who likes to make jokes.
The best premium in fashion
There was probably no more appropriate place in the world than Paris to showcase a premium of fashion, and there was probably no more distinguished fashion designer and bon vivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion contest 'el B√≥ton-Mango Fashion Adwards' to promote and international increase of young fashion talent.
This will be awarded with a cash prize of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings in the window of the Mango store on Boulevard Haussmann 54 in Paris yesterday and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest store of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m ¬≤.
The biggest store is in London.
So many events have happened that one would like to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his chairmanship of the jury for the competition, and it all ended with a luxury dinner at Opera National de Paris.
Surrounded by many famous people, the boardroom table, organized by Mango, seemed spectacular.
Nati, with a heavy heart broken by the recent death of his brother, pulled himself together. He put on the suit from the fashion house and put on some stunning pieces of jewelry by ELAH. He held on to the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall, and accompanied Valentino at the dinner in his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the house Mango, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier that he ended up without jackets together with the Baron von Rotschild, because jackets they lent to the ladies.
M√≥nica Cruz, hurried to the shop wearing trousers and a shirt, which she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. On a night walk through the Opera accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet rehearsals, so she got excited, remembered the old times, grabbed a pole and did a kind of 'grand plie'.
In√©s Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the palace, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning, we were pleased to see Oliver Mart√≠nez, a figure who always evokes a tempestuous enthusiasm, and Jon Travolta, who, upon his arrival (with his own sheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance for a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Advice against stress
There are not 1000, but one more way to forget chaotic and fast-paced everyday life.
And even if they are few, they are all gathered together in a book on how to relax, which will be available in bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is a penalty when it rings at 7 o'clock in the morning, but even worse seems the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that current life demands.
The office is called the tension and the computer, which leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is not one and not two ways of combating daily exhaustion and the problems of switching off from the world of work.
But the number increases, no more and no less than up to 1001.
In addition to yoga postures, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the whole list of possibilities that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called '1001 Ways to Relax' and so the peace that the book conveys comes to the bookstores of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace of mind in areas such as the workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual refutes such belief.
In addition, the methods of staying in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation are offered.
When the adrenaline in your veins stops rising to restore balance to your body and stress has become a problem, the time has come to sit down on the sofa, switch off your brain and concentrate on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some children speak at night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak while they are asleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be terrified, but in reality it does not matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and young people.
Certainly, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in a lifetime, for example, during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child cannot remember anything.
There is no single cause that causes this phenomenon.
Often connections are sought with other phenomena in sleep, such as nightmares, panic anxiety at night, enuresis noctura (bedwetting at night), speaking during sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we have mentioned before, it can be due to very high fiber, stressful situations or overexertion.
In any case, this is a little-explored phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It can be that one speaks calmly in individual words, whispers, or it can be quite the opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the utterance is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and to consult a specialist to check if there is a problem that causes anxiety and comes about in this way.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it will not be treated unless it is associated with some other sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, sleep apnea or stress).
What you can do is perform a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to arouse the child before sleeping.
So, choose quiet play for the child and avoid stressful TV programmes that are awful and a bit too wild.
For the nervous children to whom relaxation is recommended, relaxation methods can be used to help them to get a certain inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep soundly.
Once speaking occurs during sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and the next day he will not be able to remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, for the child is unconscious, so you will pull him out of his sleep.
Although the child speaks, he sleeps, so he rests.
Remember, if the child is frightened after a couple of apparitions, it is recommended to seek counseling or to find out why the child is frightened.
When they understand what they are saying (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on them to conduct an interrogation and get more information.
So you will not be able to achieve anything with it, because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says it, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
t tell the child that you hear this at night and know its secrets.
Not even as a joke.
It causes a lot of anxiety.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, this is a moment that only lasts a few minutes.
Illuminated houses... at last
After a long losing streak, Illumina is finally back on the field.
Without much effort, the All Blacks created numerous scoring chances and managed to convert one of them to win the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers struggled to show off their skills, was not very high.
After an initial attack by the visiting captain Kauffmann, whose long-range shot narrowly missed the angle, Illh√§user was to dominate the game with ease, and it was alternately Fonderflick with a long-range shot, then Hirn with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the tip of his foot who managed to challenge the Danish defence.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field, leaving only the lively Riahi at the forefront of the storm.
The start of the second half was to be decisive with first two scoring chances by Riahi and Temporale, and then with the first goal for the Illh√§user by Marais, who was in the right place to take a ball that had been deflected in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the Illuminati goalscorer was not to enjoy his luck for long and was sent to the bench about twelve minutes later, leaving his team-mates outnumbered.
Denmark, however, failed to capitalise and did not pose much of a problem to an Ilham side who retreated just a little to 'consolidate' their defence, except in the very last seconds of the game, when the ball went very close to the crossbar after a great scramble.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour to Brittany.
Faced with the firm stance of the fishermen who blocked access to several ports in Brittany and Norman on Monday, the French President decided to meet with their representatives in Guilvinec harbour in Finist√®re on Tuesday morning.
The latter promised to receive it 'in a constructive spirit' and hope that it will come with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit comes at the same time as a general meeting of the crisis committee set up by Brittany's fishermen to push through measures to deal with the extreme rise in the price of diesel, which has reached a record high of over EUR 1.14 per litre on average.
According to Elysee Palace spokesman David Martinon, "the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies become competitive again and to safeguard the working conditions and pay of seafarers."
Sarkozy is expected with determination by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they led protest marches in Morbihan and Calvados, causing traffic jams of nearly 10 kilometers.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-√Æle were not severed.
The peninsula of Quiberon was demarcated with a barrier.
Already on Monday, the seafarers showed their determination by burning tyres and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient from the early morning onwards, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vend√©e, where the fishing boats did not leave, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of the merchant ships.
In the evening, the fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique lifted the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting at the ministry before deciding on possible measures.
Indeed, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reaction to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue 'because' the fishermen will not give in on any point 'and' they do not want to go to Paris', for example, announced Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen who do not pay tax on diesel currently cost around 50 cents a litre, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents a litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from 'Butch Cassidy and the Kid' has died at the age of 83 from cancer at his Connecticut home.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or even Sam Mendes said goodbye to the cinema legend and the dedicated actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its 2008 delivery guidance
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects to deliver 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of recession, as a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, is meeting its 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 aircraft delivered, said its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes for a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the order of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider divesting more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the insurer American International Group, which has received financial support from the US Monetary Authority, is considering giving up more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion advanced to it.
AIG is poised to sell most of its operations, beyond its international life insurance and retirement plans in the United States.
According to the FT, AIG's board of directors met Sunday night to review possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
Among the assets from which AIG would potentially divest are its aircraft leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity, the FT said.
No final decision has been made on those sales, the FT continues.
AIG must expedite the sales to repay the $85 billion in loans granted to it by the Federal Reserve, even at the risk that the American authorities will receive 80% of its capital and that its current shareholders will lose the same amount.
Analysis Historic Paris of the session Historic Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic fall in prices on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to bail out the banks, with the Dow Jones losing 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdaq down 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 777.68 points to 10,365.45.
In terms of points, the strongest fall in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the fall in trade following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 106.85 points, or 8.81 percent, to 1,106.55.
Wall Street, already battered at the start of the quarter, collapsed after the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected the plan to rescue the banks, which was supposed to restore some stability to the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 in favor, lawmakers denied Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had asked for.
Nearly two in three Republicans opposed his plan.
'This creates a bad image that portrays Congress as incapable of passing a plan, 'said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market was counting on this plan, 'she added, fearing that a project approved in several days' time will be 'too late'.
'If the project is indeed doomed (...), it will quickly become the task of the Fed (the US central bank, ed.) and other central banks to get the crisis under control, which would further constrain credit conditions, 'warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza stressed, emphasising the sense of extreme urgency, that 'every day that passes brings the ruin of a financial company' in the United States'.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, US authorities planned to buy Wachovia's banking operations from rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the UK, the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing 'not just an American crisis, but a global crisis', the FTN Financial analyst added.
The market for basic commodities has grown strongly.
Revenue from the Treasury fell from 3.632 per cent to 3.827 per cent over ten years on Friday night, and from 4.161 per cent to 4.357 per cent over 30 years last night.
Obama, winner by points in first televised duel
Friday's first debate between the two candidates for the White House was followed by another to determine who would emerge victorious, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, Republicans and Democrats alike announced their own victory in the televised duel, which was to be watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, while respectable, was not 'brilliant' enough to allow him to halt his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which released a poll on Saturday showing Obama leading by five points (49% to 44% for McCain), believes the Democrat is clearly the better performer.
Among undecided voters, those who matter now, Obama came out on top with 39%, while a CBS poll found 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the strong performance expected from his rival, Joseph Biden, in the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
'It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, 'warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain continued to emphasize his undeniable foreign policy experience, clearly underscoring his opponent's' naivety 'on the issues that were at the heart of this first televised duel.
'Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that... 'he stressed several times.
'I don't think Senator Obama has the experience or knowledge to be president, 'he asserted.
A point of attack that has been preached in Republican campaign commercials since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He made a brief and precise statement, without letting himself get caught up in it.
He emphasized his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image the world has of the United States.
'McCain still doesn't understand, Obama does, 'countered a Democratic campaign ad this weekend that accused Republicans of failing to grasp the full extent of the crisis weighing on' Americans off the streets. '
'During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing to say about you, 'Obama said yesterday to 20,000 people gathered in pouring rain at an election rally in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words' middle class' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis gives a clear advantage to Obama, whom Americans believe is best placed to save the economy even from the brink.
'The coming week could be a pivotal turning point, 'influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic nominee, the current crisis is' the culmination of eight years of bad economic policies implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain. '
After reiterating that he would even be able to lower taxes for 95% of Americans, despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois senator pointed out that creating the country's potential energy independence and promoting renewable energy, along with establishing a health insurance system, were his top priorities.
McCain, by contrast, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates cautiously dodged questions about the $700 billion (‚Ç¨470 billion) plan to rescue the financial market, which was approved by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
'Did you notice that there was an election in Minsk? '
Young people and opposition activists demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered in Minsk's main square on Sunday evening to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections since the polling stations closed.
Although no result had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukakhenko: 'The dictator should resign'.
Some admit they didn't vote in the first place: 'What good is that if they do what they want with my vote anyway,' says one young woman.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is prepared to make a democratic change.
Sanctions, including the non-issuance of visas to 40 leading Belarusian figures and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the elections were judged to be clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
'We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the count, 'said Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a coalition of 12 parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasises Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and for us it is the executive.
When opposition MPs enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean TV airtime, regional meetings and legislative proposals. '
The opposition therefore owes it to itself to interfere in the political game, because 'dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis and we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent. '
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the vote, does not recognise the election as valid.
It stresses that the turnout figures appear to be too high and that the extension of voting in advance (26% of Minsk voters) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
'Did you notice that there was an election? 'asks the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, the ones most likely to be in line with the government's wishes. '
The silence of the night descends again over the Octoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Conversation - The Blood That Became Safe Again
Yesterday, Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its President, Dr Francine D√©cary, had every reason to rejoice because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
Above all, it has regained public confidence, badly shaken by the contaminated blood scandal of the 1980 "s and 1990" s.
It is known that the national blood reserves administered by the Blood Service of the Canadian Red Cross were contaminated with HIV and hepatitis C during the 1980s.
Faced with this tragedy and public dissatisfaction, the Government of Canada launched a public inquiry in February 1994, led by Judge Horace Krever, with the aim of shedding light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to draw up guidelines to prevent another disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever hesitated to issue his report, several provinces set up a committee to develop a new system for managing blood stocks in Canada.
In Quebec, the G√©lineau Committee carried out this task.
According to reports by G√©lineau and Krever, two blood banks have been established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society, to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
'In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started its work, barely 38% of people had confidence in the blood collection system in Quebec, 'remembers Dr D√©cary.
The situation was dispiriting.
Through enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood vessels, and through work in this field over the following years, we have regained the public's trust, 'she says, before proudly pointing out that by early 2008, almost 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
But Dr D√©cary keeps in mind that 'trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its inception on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has followed the precautionary principle.
At that time, we witnessed the emergence in Europe of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says this woman, who has been in charge since its inception in 1998.
'And we didn't have the slightest idea if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we invoked one of the main guidelines of the Krever and G√©lineau reports, according to which exclusion measures are applied when we do not know and when a disease progresses slowly, as is evidently the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which manifests itself in brain degeneration, which inevitably leads to death.
Thus, in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago it was proven beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
Thus, this event has shown us that the precautionary principle that we have applied does make sense.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (NSTs), which make it possible to detect the presence of the virus itself directly in the blood of the donor, rather than the antibodies to the virus, as was the case with the tests used to date.
NST has made it possible to shorten the incubation period between the time the person is infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood using our techniques, explains the specialist.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
This has substantially reduced the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it and without being able to detect it.
These improvements have made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
'In other words, you'd have to distribute 12 million blood samples before anyone would be infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood samples each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission occurs through a blood sample.
I believe that nowadays you can feel good when you get or prescribe a blood transfusion to restore health, 'says the director of Hema-Quebec.
'Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogen can get into the system.
Just last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of R√©union, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by insects through the blood.
We must monitor continuously, 'continues Dr D√©cary, before stressing that Hema-Quebec must provide sufficient care in addition to secure care.
'Demand is rising because the population's ageing.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population is also having an impact on the blood donor network, which, on average, includes only 3% of Quebec's eligible population. '
Every healthy person who is 18 years or older and meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who make their blood available are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and anyone who has travelled to a country where malaria is prevalent is excluded from giving blood for one year.
'With this 3%, we're able to get an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies is very rare.
But we need to renew the members of this donor network as they get older and are unable to donate blood.
It is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to keep it and to get them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that you rarely find the time to spend an hour giving blood, 'Francine D√©cary laments.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin, which is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being temporarily stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec's only public umbilical cord blood bank.
The umbilical cord, once considered biomedical waste, contains blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukaemia.
'A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we're planning to take more than a thousand each year.
'We should probably start making it available for transplants early next year, 'explains Dr D√©cary, who describes the umbilical cord blood collection programme as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced they don't have access to it 'because Hema-Quebec lacks the resources to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
Montreal's Impact qualified yesterday for the semifinals of the USL's premier league elimination round thanks to a 3-1 win (4-3 with all goals) over the Seattle Sounders in the second and deciding game of the quarterfinal series at Saputo Stadium, where the total goal ratio counted.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute.
After a first half without a goal for either side, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other for Montreal.
Roger Levesque was the only one standing in Matt Jordan's way for the Sounders.
Recall that in the first game of the pre- and postseason series on Friday, Impact inflicted a 2-1 defeat on the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
Impact will face Vancouver's Whitecaps in the semifinals.
Saturday night, the Thunder overcame a 3-1 deficit in Minnesota with a 4-3 victory, but the Whitecaps still advanced to the semifinals with a 5-4 aggregate score.
Impact will likely face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be finalised today.
In short - victory by Kovalev
The number one trio of the Canadian team is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit made up of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn led the attack on the Florida Panthers with a tornado, leading to a 3-2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec supplied two assists and Kovalev converted a pass in that victory game, the Tricolore's fourth in six preseason games.
Kovalev scored the win by scoring the only goal of the entire shootout.
'I'm not ready yet, 'warned the Russian.
I need one more game to feel good. '
'He focused too much on it in the first half, 'said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He got a huge round of applause. '
Charest focuses on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out calling an election before the end of the year.
As soon as the Liberal Party's General Assembly was over, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to be elected in today's partial election.
'Shifting the course of our last great border to the north ': this is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented with visual means yesterday at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, fully following the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three giant screens spun spectacular images of hydroelectric power stations, mines, viewed from Quebec in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large appropriations as during the parliamentary term.
Speaking to the press, the Prime Minister refused to rule out holding the elections this autumn, even though he said his schedule was very busy.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'vision' that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic area', which envisages an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been mentioned frequently in the Prime Minister's speeches of late, the opening up of the North - the northern area at the 49th parallel - has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the prime minister limited himself to explaining why the North is' a jewel with enormous potential ', but did not give a date, amount of investment or precise priorities for future projects.
At most, some prospects of what more could be worked on: above all, water energy, forests, but especially the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of emerging economies and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr Charest's listing, the North has' nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This' area twice the size of France '' is near us, is in Quebec.
It's not just in our vicinity, it's in us, 'he said, as if to show he was trying to make a national dream come true.
Quebec has grown greatly through its connection with the north, he emphasized: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
'It's ours, it's our future, 'he added after pausing theatrically to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of Labrador that Quebec has always demanded, the premier told the press.
'This is a traditional stance that all governments have adopted, 'he said.
There is a boundary line where there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity arises I will take that position again on behalf of the government, 'he said.
In addition, 'with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,' he said, talking about the Northwest Passage, which will be navigable year-round due to melting ice.
Against this new geopolitical backdrop, the Prime Minister believes that it is almost a duty to occupy this territory.
And the inhabitants of the area, the indigenous people and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the young.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel L√©tourneau (former peccist MP for Ungava) have already started consultations with some thirty communities.
A ministerial committee chaired by Beno√Æt Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role, has started work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a big gathering, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity to 'build a common vision'.
Furthermore, the development of the North will take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
Plan North will be 'discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this' vision 'as if it were a continuation of the Liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
'Like the Liberals who came before us, we've rethought to turn the challenges into new growth and development opportunities.
This, by the way, was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage taking over the party leadership.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the Beauharnois power station as the Ad√©lard Godbout dam.
'From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage, who achieved the silent revolution and nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party has always known how to determine the future, 'Jean Charest said.
To the press he referred to another, this time conservative, project, the 'Roads to the North' programme of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr Charest emphasises that its commissioning is planned for 2012.
'It stays with us, but I plan to be there, 'he confided to his party members, prompting a storm of applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly in 2009, has not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which is legally possible for him.
He stresses, however, that his schedule is full, mainly because of a Community Council mission to China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly at the weekend gave the Liberal leader a platform of nationalist plans, especially 'constitutional objectives', which were readily adopted: the PLQ demands in particular that the 'peculiarity of Quebec' be recognised in the constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and for them to have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the guidelines of the Northern Plan were received with scepticism.
The leader of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois, Pauline Marois, has revived the Northern Quebec development policy introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, when she came to power in 2003, the Liberal government refrained from using them.
If she had done so, 'we would be much further along today,' Ms Marois said alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today) Fran√ßoise Mercure.
The ADQ has said it will support the government's adoption of a Northern Plan.
'But what we want is for this not just to be a big show, 'said party leader S√©bastien Proulx, standing in for Mario Dumont, who is returning from holiday today.
Letters - A dishonored country
It was Mr Vic Toews, ex-' Justice 'Minister (what an irony) in the Harper cabinet, who last summer took the liberty of saying of Louise Arbour that she was a' disgrace 'to Canada.
This woman who has waged a never-ending battle for justice, and who deserves all our admiration, so much opprobrium, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as it does about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that is the only one from all the countries concerned that has not brought home its compatriot who was imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not even consider that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when the things he is accused of happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada is a signatory to the Geneva Convention, is breaking its word and allowing a child soldier to vegetate in inhumane conditions.
The only one who condescends to a judicial parody to judge the guilt of the accused.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers in particular are calling for Omar Khadr to be brought home so that he can receive a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that turns a blind eye to torture: it does not care that a young adult, after so many years of torment, will surely be emotionally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but what we are witnessing here is an insidious curtailment of our rights, of our freedom and of our 'democracy', a word that Harper constantly carries around like a flag, and which sounds so meaningless from his mouth.
The time has therefore come when morality no longer exists: a Canadian citizen can be arbitrarily mistreated, tortured and imprisoned, at the discretion of a head of government who, to this day, is supported only by the minority (may he be a minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has renounced what has been the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in that slogan, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Deputy General Manager of the Canadian gold mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, using Orwellian logic, that the world's largest gold mining company was seeking a six million libel action against three authors and a small penniless publishing house, with the aim of opening up a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of libel actions, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to engage in public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to express an opinion contrary to theirs.
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of the Book of Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid from the near-inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
Moreover, the tactic of these unequal struggles is often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consensual settlement that silences the opposing side and also discourages anyone who dares to revisit the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have presented its view before public opinion.
Contrary to what is commonplace in many of the countries in which Barrick Gold operates, in Canada debates are usually conducted through the exchange of ideas, not through blows.
So it would have sufficed if the gold mine had disclosed its books and files and opened up a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent audit teams that could have shed light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no faith in public opinion, brushing aside petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada with a wave of the hand.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how, at the same time, he can ask for a 'public' debate and yet disregard the opinions of that very public?
Apparently, in the world of the vice president, that word only encompasses generously paid lawyers, not the community of all Canadians; a pretty narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public, which supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada, does so largely because it rejects the gold mine's brutal stance.
This public is willing to listen and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in what many perceive as a gag suit (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just made a demand to the authors of Noir Canada, asking them to stop using the term...).
Aside from Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's lawsuit is a direct attack on academic freedom and truth-telling, which are fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss the facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to research and debate issues that the world's rich companies do not like, who else can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could conduct it by following the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to reply.
The university environment to which we belong has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims, it has no appetite for transparent debate.
This is a loss to the university world, as well as to public debate, and it is time for governments to take action to curb this type of unwarranted complaint.
Wall Street bailout - Democrats and Republicans get along
The Bush administration and senior members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, designed to stop the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months, has yet to be approved by both chambers of Congress.
The main contents are: better control of MEPs over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public money used, new provisions to limit the number of houses seized due to arrears, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the executives of the supported companies.
The US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, after a two-day marathon of negotiations.
'We have made great strides toward an agreement that will be effective in the marketplace, 'Bush administration official Henry Paulson said.
'It was all done to protect the real economy and the American people from the crisis on Wall Street, 'the Democrat said.
'This is the fundamental point: If we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and turmoil in the daily lives of Americans will be enormous, 'Republican Judd Gregg said.
Negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, fearing the effect that another failure would have on investor sentiment.
The deadline agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who entered the negotiations late, were more in favour of the agreement, but did not fail to express their dissatisfaction with the need to hit them in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted that certain executive orders be added to the settlement, especially those that would allow owners to keep their homes and those that affect the salaries of the executives of the companies rescued by the state.
'When you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain people, it's not something you can congratulate yourself on.
But these measures are necessary, 'he said on US television.
When asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: 'I'd like to know the details first, but I hope so.
'The guidelines I've read [show] that this is something we're all going to have to digest and move forward with.
The option of doing nothing at all is simply not acceptable, 'he said.
The $700 billion plan is aimed at using taxpayers' money
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of risky subprime mortgages, before spreading to other forms of more widespread bonds (PCAAs), and finally to a freeze in financial strength and the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican lawmakers who failed the first attempt at a deal last week.
Ever since Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of distressed companies should be secured only by the government, not bought, they believe they have escaped the impasse.
To round things off for everyone in Congress, an executive order was added stating that if the government made a loss on the program within five years, it could then levy new taxes to get its capital back.
The new plan calls for the payment of an initial sum of $250 billion, to which a further $100 billion could be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion must be approved by Congress in another vote.
In return for its help, Washington gets shares in the companies it supports, which it pays dividends on profits, and which it can sell again when the storm passes.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to halt the attachment proceedings concerning the homes linked to the real estate loans affected by this plan, and also to set deadlines for repayment and severance payments to the executives of the companies concerned.
Developers of the plan would like the House of Representatives to vote on it as early as today, and the Senate to vote on it on Wednesday.
Despite their best efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
Indeed, there were more voices against the plan yesterday, from both Republicans and Democrats.
'Obviously, Washington doesn't understand us, 'Republican Scott Garett, a member of the chamber's Finance Committee, told voters.
'Yes, we've got a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But it's not the one that's going to make taxpayers pay. '
Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, who heads a group in Congress called the "Caucus of Skeptics," puts things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
'Four hundred distinguished economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us that we are asking Congress not to be pressured and to think carefully about which way to go, 'he said yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe have once again seen proof that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg came after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy out its competitor, which has been in deep trouble since losing 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) in the crisis due to high-risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not lost money, 'Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, we are given the right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households value now that uncertain times are looming. '
During this period, on the other side of the Channel, the British government was in the process of nationalizing another bank that had been troubled by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from Bank Bradford and Bringley, including more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the UK bank's branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to be nationalised by the UK government since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty with azure eyes has long been his trump card, no one would say his weakness.
Had the American actor freed himself from the narcissistic mirror with his charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, sensitivity and obvious talent have probably also kept him away from a position of power that gives birth to the truly terrible monsters.
But what a great runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and for whom he had long been a kind of on-screen rival, more meticulous in his acting, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and breaking dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often makes wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
From his European roots came one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, ultimate quality feature.
For it reflected a whole country that was in love with the self-made man, the fighter who was wounded in battle in the Pacific War, who studied acting at Yale in the early 1950s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before finding success in the theatre, on television and soon in the cinema.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also the driver who finished second in the 1979 24 Hours of Mans, and also a sex symbol, despite having lived in a model relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him disappear also the unknown facets of this mysterious, reserved, committed and over-sensitive to the glamour of showbusiness, the riddle of which will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman sent cinema-goers into a frenzy this weekend as all his major roles were played out on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in constant change passes with him.
The charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) comes to mind again, as does the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Hot Tin Roof, which was made into a film by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much more recent memory (1990) is awakened, that of his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who in his old age is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all its promises.
There have been so many other Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, boisterous, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role that was meant for James Dean but was revived after his death and made Newman a household name in 1956.
This likeable crook in the outstanding The Sting (The Clou), which won the Oscar for best film in 1973.
As an embittered and vindictive billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
That face through the ages, that was him.
Still him.
His CV combines epochs.
Young people know him primarily from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the unorthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen brothers.
A final role in 2003 as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in Sam Mendes's Road to Perdition came full circle.
In contrast to several cinema legends who retired from the film world early enough, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his pomp and his concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humour, as a living challenge to 'underplaying' as he judged his over-expressive performances.
The profession has not always been easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, who for a long time found the roles so alluring.
But he rarely played Sunnyboys as outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, naysayers or the desperate, whose perfect portrayal reflected his slide and rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (based on the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence), starring his wife Joanne Woodward, painted a subtle portrait of a woman full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son to him, a work full of sensitivity and sadness.
Amid the deluge of tributes pouring in for Newman yesterday, his close friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had starred together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) made a poignant statement: 'His presence has improved my life and this country.'
Generosity and zest for life were essential traits of the late actor.
Aside from his legendary career, there is now a great champion of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood's drift.
We have probably often seen him standing with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and thought this was rather tasteless, although we thought it was funny at first.
Profits from his sales, however, went to his Children in Need foundation.
Instead of resting on his laurels, Newman committed himself to the shot.
He left a letter to his five daughters saying: 'Always and until the very end your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It's been an honour to be here. '
And it was an honor for us to follow the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag & amp; Co.?
On 8 October, the trial of J√°nos and his accomplices begins.
The defendants are accused in particular of involvement in organised crime, gross negligence and business fraud, as well as other criminal offences, including falsification of documents.
According to the public prosecutor's office, the funds derived from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often falsified invoices.
State funds and grants from the local government - a total of HUF 65 million - are said to have been channelled partly into the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal organisation and partly into the private coffers of individuals.
As the investigating authorities announced, fictitious invoices were submitted when the tender money was received, and the clubs are also alleged to have failed to fulfil their obligations.
According to the indictment, much of the invoices were forged.
The invoice blocks were bought at the J√≥zsefv√°ros market, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies the invoices should be issued to was made on the round trip north of Lake Balaton, to which Istv√°n Lados was sent by J√°nos.
In the course of this "exploration tour," Lados was supposed to find bed and breakfasts and restaurants.
He demanded invoices for consumption, so that he could later issue invoices based on these documents for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Budapest Self-Government.
The majority of these accounts were allegedly manipulated by Istv√°n Lados and his accomplice, Andr√°s ≈êri, who, according to our information, was responsible for drafting the corresponding reports.
One of the objectives of Lados's "exploration tour" was a beer bar.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and Co in 2003, the restaurant is said to have hosted the 90-strong group of the Biztos Pont Egyes√ºlet association.
Now, however, the head of the company says that such a large group would not have fit into the restaurant at once.
Another invoice, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb J√∂v≈ë√©rt Foundation, later known as Egy√ºtt a Harmadik √âvezred√©rt, also showed serious defects in form and content.
According to the calculation, 130 guests were staying in a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at a time.
There were apparently no limits to the imagination of the forgers of invoices when it came to Pigal Kft. a catering business whose accounts do not even show documents of the clients Jobb J√∂v≈ë√©rt and Hopp√°, according to the prosecution.
As the managing director Gy≈ëz≈ë Farkas told hvg.hu, it was immediately clear to him that the documents were forged when he was questioned by the public prosecutor's office.
"Our company name and tax number were incorrectly stamped."
Furthermore: Apart from formal errors, the fact that the establishment is supposed to have accommodated one hundred people, when they have a total of eleven rooms, which cannot possibly accommodate so many people, was also wrong.
Food was also listed on the invoice, although the restaurant had not been in operation for some time.
The diligent forgers of invoices also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they targeted only offers trips abroad, and so they indicated trips to Hungary on the cash invoice, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
As the investigation has revealed, they have also included VAT on their invoices, even though travel agency services to a country outside the EU are exempt from VAT.
The total amount of VAT was incorrect on four invoices issued by Hotel R√©vf√ºl√∂p Kft. to the Jobb J√∂v≈ë√©rt Foundation, as the company charges only 15 per cent VAT instead of 25, and the employees only issue machine invoices, but the forged documents were handwritten.
Another mistake made by the "accountants" was that in one case they stated "transport of goods" as the service provided, although this is not offered by the firm specialising in investment advice, the prosecutor's office said.
Due to other formal errors - wrong invoice format, wrong stamp - the invoices issued to Egy√ºtt a Harmadik √âvezred√©rt Alap√≠tv√°ny, as well as to XXI. Sz√°zadi Kultur√°lis Egyes√ºlet and Biztos Pont could be exposed as forgeries.
Likewise in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Kunfeh√©rt√≥ sports camp, whose managers claimed never to have issued the invoices.
Another "mistake" was made by the forgers at HIB Kft. in Ny√≠regyh√°za: this company was in liquidation at the time (2001) when the group of the Fiatal V√°ros√©rt Egyes√ºlet was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore stated that he had not issued the invoices himself.
Deliberately fake
The other group of accountants are people who were well aware that they would have to submit fictitious invoices.
At the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj√∫ Szocialist√°k, the Es√©ly Budapest√©rt Alap√≠tv√°ny Foundation has issued invoices for the Egy√ºtt a Harmadik √âvezred√©rt Foundation amounting to approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Gy√∂rfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft. which is also currently in liquidation, is also alleged to have cooperated with Zuschlag and Co.: In 2003, the Ltd. supplied the Jobb J√∂v≈ë√©rt Alap√≠tv√°ny Foundation and the Atlasz Egyes√ºlet and V√∂r√∂sfeny≈ë Egyes√ºlet associations with falsified invoices with a total value of HUF 5 million relating to services not rendered.
However, there was also no payment transaction, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after they were issued, which the persons concerned forgot to mention in their documents.
The third group of accountants includes persons directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iv√°n Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Tri√≥ Kft., a fuel and vehicle trading company based in Budapest but untraceable there.
Between October and December 2005, this company is alleged to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components with a total value of approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigating authority, Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, acted as the purchaser of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, to whom the company documents were also to be delivered by Iv√°n Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov confessed during the investigation to having issued invoices in the name of the limited liability company to the associations Atlasz and Hopp√°, as well as to Egy√ºtt and Harmadik √âvezred√©rt Alap√≠tv√°ny and to having collected their equivalent value himself.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian masons at Iv√°n Kubatov's express request.
In reality, however, none of these companies were active, which the defendant said was due to a lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to profit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was in charge of preparing the company formation documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to associations associated with the contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Gener√°ci√≥.
Kubatov is alleged to have issued 15 invoices totalling HUF 14.2 million to the organisations on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Tri√≥, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade.
The prosecutor's office assumes that Kubatov may have collected 10% of the invoice amount as well as VAT.
Kubatov is even alleged to have abused the Szi-Beri Bt. company for issuing fictitious invoices - in this case, the invoices were attached to the applications of Biztos Pont.
Y-Gener√°ci√≥ and Sz√∂vets√©g a Modern Magyarorsz√°g√©rt submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, T√°ncsics Mih√°ly Alap√≠tv√°ny ("TMA") in January 2006.
Both received 500,000 forints each, but misused these amounts.
To cover this up, they submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team Kft. to the TMA.
Incidentally, these invoices were seized during the search of the office of √Årp√°d Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
At the hearings, some of the defendants are now expected to confess to the falsification of accounts, as they have already done before the public prosecutor's office.
A sensation could ensue if the lead defendant, J√°nos Zuschlag, decides to make a full confession.
In fact, his previous statements were less detailed, and although he had already promised several times to report fully on everything, his confession has yet to be made.
The question therefore remains whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have made a pact with him to compensate him for most of the HUF 50 million damage caused, and whether he is prepared to accept responsibility in return.
However, it is entirely possible that Zuschlag will now play the "offended" after his pleas for mitigation of imprisonment and house arrest fell on deaf ears.
While other criminals who have caused far greater damage with economic crimes and have not remunerated them are at large, or at least under house arrest, Zuschlag is denied this possibility.
The psychology of outbidding - or why we're willing to pay more
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue what is being offered.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic basis of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in "Science" magazine, people do not want to be beaten in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even inflated prices.
The researchers tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was asked to play the lottery while the other participated in a playful activity - in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
In both games, participants were able to win money, but increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cortex, was measured in auction losers, where outbidding of the opponent plays a major role.
Among many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
To back up their thesis, the economists in the Research Unit have also conducted research on tracking money.
In this case, three groups should bid against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their bets.
Another group was also promised a $15 reward if they emerged victorious.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which was also lost if the game was lost.
The only difference between the two groups was that the emphasis in one group was on winning and the other on losing.
However, as evidence of the hypotheses expressed by neurologists, the members of the "anti-losing" group were willing to bet higher than those in the control or "win" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
These have justified the behaviour observed at auctions so far only with the joy of winning, or rather the avoidance of risk.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved thanks to neurological imaging techniques, so we now have a third explanation, "said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should I see a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is due to the fact that patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - hepatitis and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in the case of hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, through contaminated food or water), and in the case of hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other bodily fluids (such as semen, vaginal secretions or saliva).
Travellers are advised to be vaccinated against viruses A and B, but there is no vaccine against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two to three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
Jaundice then appears on the skin and eyes, stool becomes light, urine darkens, and recovery can take up to two to three weeks.
Worldwide, around 1 million people die each year from the far more serious diseases caused by hepatitis B, such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten people infected is on medication.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen treacherously destroys the liver cells - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is therefore essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed people.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C sufferers worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
As the disease can already be detected during a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your GP at the first signs of unknown origin.
Recognised in good time, the disease can be cured and the virus can be eradicated, thereby reducing the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first held in 2004 by patient advocacy groups around the world.
The aim of the action is to raise awareness of this chronic inflammation of the liver caused by viruses, its emergence and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
Recent research shows that religious faith acts as a kind of "painkiller," which is said to have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment to investigate the extent to which belief in God influences people's perception of pain, reported the British newspaper "Telegraph."
In the more bizarre investigation, 12 believers and one atheist each received electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, believers were able to eliminate most of the pain.
A brain scan technology has even shown that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project involving not only scientists but also philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university.
During the experiment, the subjects were tied to a sparkling device on their left hand, which delivered the electric shocks.
Participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: a painting of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Ermine."
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke a kind of religious trance among the faithful, while they chose da Vinci's painting because it was little different from the other painting and was perceived as reassuring.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, and received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they were asked to look at either the religious or the other painting.
Catholics reported feeling "safe" at the sight of the Mother of God, as if they were "cared for," and they felt "peace and quiet."
While viewing the religious painting, they reported 12% less pain than if they had Leonardo's work in front of them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that similar effects could also be produced with other strong-looking images in atheists, one just had to find the corresponding photo.
"We would have to find an image that elicits very positive sensations, such as a mother or father," the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practising the faith should change our personality, and it does in many cases," Wright said.
After these excellent results, the only question that remains is what effect a Madonna painting by Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the regulation of the pain of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the occasion of its tenth birthday, Google has every right to say that it is in people's pockets as well as above their heads in the sky: it knows where people have spent their holidays, which specialists they go to, and what moves them.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's chief executives.
In the direction of sceptics who are plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he points out that these would overlook the very essence of Web 2.0.
In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt said that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal information about users, moving closer to the company's original goal of "ordering all the information in the world."
Schmidt said that after ten years of world-changing work, Google is still only at the beginning of information gathering.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said he wished Google would be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "Which job really suits me?," but software programs are not yet able to do so because they don't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches, the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they searched, and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search," introduced two years ago, allows visitors to save their own search history and access it later, so that the results can be generated much more precisely later, and the so-called "recommendations," with which the system recommends tailor-made products and services based on previous preferences, are based on the same logic.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of data misuse - "If you look at what I do" - and some are concerned about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is the potential power represented by the company that is scary, rather than the sense of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or the revolt against power, that is rejected by many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties on occasion, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was the recent action against paedophilia in Brazil, in which Google handed over to the Brazilian Government information collected by the Community site called 'Orkut', which also made it possible to identify paedophilia.
However, users concerned about their personal rights were able to breathe a sigh of relief in May, when Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF, successfully took the FBI to court: according to this, Google cannot be forced under any section of the Constitution to hand over information to the FBI on a secret request.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act passed years ago; however, the list of individual users, respectively their web and search terms list, has been withheld from it for two months retroactively.)
So Google's image remains controversial: those who are reluctant to disclose their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and intimacy by using Google's services are castigating the company with the indignation that befits conservative companies.
Meanwhile, the American "geek culture," which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists, and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which, thanks to Windows, is the market leader, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require identification codes from its users and makes its services available free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seem far more attractive, youthful, and cool than the software giant's official practices.
On the other hand, geeks are razor-sharp in understanding the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet - a relationship that has come to the fore in recent years, especially thanks to the term "Web 2.0."
"Web 2.0" is all about collaboration, in other words, the users intentionally leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions vary from individual to individual, the main thing remains the same, namely to show up publicly.
The average young person can manage their profiles simultaneously on multiple community portals - from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them using other services, such as Twitter, or music services, such as last.fm, and can eventually integrate all of this into a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. They can also maintain blogs that automatically display the latest photo galleries posted on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove this: when looking at the party photos from the previous night, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful boyfriend has been having fun with, or the employee is fired because he honestly vents his anger about the company's management on his blog - one thing is certain: the term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Who leads an online life is what he or she reveals about himself or herself - something like this could be the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's youth.
And anyone who tries to keep something secret, or even circumvent Google's monopoly, is welcome to do so - for example, with Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google's search engine but deliberately leaves no trace.
Quite a few people deliberately do not register on community sites so that they cannot be found, but Google's online applications, such as word processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can also be circumvented with alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible user profile.
Public opinion, meanwhile, is anxiously waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords / AdSense's advertising space is threatening advertising agencies "revenues, and the increasingly rapid introduction of services is a headache not only for Microsoft, but also for other software developers.
Critics, however, also find the troubling counter-poles: for example, the company's management rejected an employee protest after the company's kindergarten fees were doubled, and management said that multiple meals for employees were too expensive. However, all this seems positively mild compared to the fact that Google even bowed to the Chinese government in 2006 and agreed to an agreement that all dissident hits, or those that violate good taste, would be filtered out.
The company's internal policy is that no new service is advertised in advance, but only when it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could turn things around: While some believe that Google's book and magazine scanning and archiving project is now assuming proportions, that the company will soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are more concerned about the "Health" system, which enables the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database is already providing the stuff for the next generation of sci-fi writers - for example, "Scroogled," Cory Doctorow's famous novel describes, in the best Orwellian style, a future in which a human being becomes frighteningly approachable thanks to Google-sourced data.
Two teenagers help √ìzd double murderer clean up his tracks
Police have now questioned two teenagers suspected of helping clear the tracks in connection with √ìzd's double murder, Borsod Police Commissioner's spokesman said on Tuesday.
The youths confessed and are now facing charges of aiding and abetting.
According to the MTI news agency, there are two girls who are defending themselves at large.
Aiding and abetting is punishable by up to five years in prison.
The suspect in √ìzd's double murder, a 23-year-old local man, was remanded in custody on Sunday.
The man is under serious suspicion of intentionally murdering several people out of greed for money.
During the course of the investigation it emerged that the 23-year-old owed a 53-year-old a large sum of money.
The suspect did not want to pay his debts, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor to a property in √ìzd, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the crime from a long time ago - this is also proved by the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the scene.
Police are now working with experts to investigate the crime weapon and the circumstances surrounding its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Launches Offer to Purchase Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has bid around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, for a 100 percent stake in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reiterated the offer made by Poles despite the fact that they had previously been excluded by the Czechs as possible owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is wholly owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which intends to sell more than 60% of the shares in the coming months.
According to reports in the Czech daily "E15," the Polish offer contains the highest purchase price ever offered on the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B√∂rse have so far submitted offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange was probably the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at CZK 5-10 billion.
Under the terms of the shareholder agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Cesk√° Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
In comments devoted to the worsening international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers on Tuesday spoke of the "second 9 / 11."
We owe the global financial catastrophe to the American president, according to "La Repubblica" - the president was not even able to rally his own party behind the bill that was supposed to bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of what billionaire investor Warren Buffett called a "new Pearl Harbor," it would be more appropriate to talk about a "second 9 / 11."
Sections of the press in Madrid also find the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is to blame for the fact that the global economy is now teetering on the brink of collapse.
The American financial system is on the brink of collapse, and the whole world will suffer as a result.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington does not have the political means to manage the crisis.
The global economy is hanging in the air just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, according to the "Tages-Anzeiger" in Geneva.
To be sure, some governments could still provide rescue packages to their faltering financial institutions, and use taxpayers "money to save the banks from bankruptcy.
But if there is a domino effect and more banks fail, neither further injections nor other emergency measures will help.
In the long run, EU member states would have to step out of their shadows and centralize control of money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion was paid out to failing financial institutions, reminds Vienna's Der Standard. In addition, the newspaper continues, concerns are becoming more and more realistic that, after the Americans, European taxpayers will now have to dig a little deeper into their pockets in order to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously addressed the crisis that is now sweeping across the old continents like a tsunami.
The "saviors" would not have to "wobble" immediately with several hundred billion euros, but it would be advisable to note in which case it would be reasonable to touch taxpayers "money in order to avert even greater damage.
Intelligent car mimics the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best way to develop new accident prevention technologies if not to imitate obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, bees.
An amazing project was presented at CEATEC in Japan, where Nissan engineers were inspired by bumblebees to create new accident-avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic system controlled by automobile robots, a mini-car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval "private area," which is very similar to our own "shield," said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of more than 300 degrees, plays an important role.
In order to mimic the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distance measurement.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a field of view of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision avoidance process.
The obstacle is registered in a fraction of a second, and the car robot immediately changes course, similar to the movement of the bees, rotating the tires at the appropriate angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this manoeuvre takes place purely instinctively.
"If it were not, the automobile robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the automobile robot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, because this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of bees when they avoid other bees.
And that has to happen in a split second.
However, unlike the bees, the swerving cannot be up, down, or even diagonal - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the manoeuvrability of the tyres.
While the bees here have an infinite number of possibilities to evade other bees, the researchers were only able to use rotary motion, respectively acceleration and deceleration, in the automobile robot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer lifespan than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process a few inputs per second and react accordingly.
It doesn't need to store them, or produce an intuitive, logical response based on previous maneuvers, so it only needs a handful of KB of memory all the time.
There is no need for gigabyte and megabyte-heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of instant collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in mass production within the next ten years.
The technology could also be used in GPS satellite navigation, by consciously steering drivers around obstacles and thus guiding them to their destination.
A name for the sinful child
Now we have the written version of the $700 billion bailout bill, which will be implemented in several stages and is aimed at buying the bad loans of banks.
Half of the money will be spent in the first round.
In a meeting that ended just after midnight local time on Saturday, members of Congress reached an agreement on the $700 billion bailout after several days of debate, Reuters reported.
"We have made substantial progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, saying that the agreement was still to be put on paper.
The compromise reached on the bailout was supported by both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the program will be effective and efficient, but more needs to be done. Pelosi said it was not about saving Wall Street, but about changing the rudder of the economy.
The written version of the package was released ahead of the opening of Asian markets at 8am on Sunday evening (Central European Time on Monday 2am), but has not caused a spike in stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the 2008 economic stabilization bill, then it will be the turn of the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are pleased with the progress that was made on the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
But the program deviates from the Bush administration's original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at once on buying bad, loan-laden securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the $700 billion will be spent, with $250 billion immediately available after Congress is expected to vote on the cause on Monday, to be spent on buying bad, credit-laden securities, with the president to decide on the remaining $100 billion.
The program is reviewed by its own commission, which includes the president of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion depends on another decision by Congress.
Under the law, the Treasury can also use a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-backed securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As responsible persons of the ministry reported, the purchase can take place both in an auction, as well as directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the funds of concern and the companies pay fees corresponding to the expected damages.
Henry Paulsen said: "The law defines the necessary resources in such a way that up to $700 billion can be made available as emergency aid to the American financial system, be it for large-scale purchases of bad assets, their insurance, or the avoidance of systemic risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
"We are taking the necessary steps to ensure that we are ready to implement the law once it is signed," Paulson said.
Bosses at the troubled banks, which are now in need of government help, can, however, expect their operations, which are casually referred to in overseas slang as "golden handshakes," to be cut by the government.
Salaries will only be cut in certain cases, and those cuts will depend on how the Treasury handles each case.
The cut essentially means that if the department buys in an auction, the "golden handshake" will be taxed, unless the retired bank chief is deported to retirement.
In the event of a direct purchase of bad loans, the government will step in aggressively to ensure that executive pay is not exaggerated.
Part of the picture is that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions only relate to new agreements, so that the more people participate in the program.
"This is the first time in American history that executive pay cuts have been legislated for," said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, commenting on the measure.
The state acquires equity in the participating banks, which reduces the risk for taxpayers, as they can also participate when the economy, and hence the rescued bank, is better off.
The bill requires the president to submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should recover their lost money from the financial sector.
But there have been skeptics on both sides who have expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American people expect of us, the plan in no way protects taxpayers' money, said California Republican Darrell Issa.
His Ohio colleague, Mary Kaptur, said the measures were pushed by the same people responsible for the Wall Street collapse.
Industrial Prices Continue to Rise

The biggest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 percent) - primarily bags and belts - where the increase was 4.6 percent, while shoes saw prices rise by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials pushed up the prices of chemicals and production considerably (1.6 percent).
Crude oil processing (1.4 percent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent), and wood processing (0.1 percent) saw a slight decline in prices.
Prices in paper production, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other sectors of manufacturing, prices rose by between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
Prices in key domestic markets for industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, rose by 0.3 percent in August, primarily as a result of the gas price increase introduced on 1 July.
Looking at the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry in a year-on-year comparison, prices in crude oil refining rose the most (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2 percent increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11 percent.
Price declines were observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The extent of inflation in other manufacturing industries ranged from 0.6 percent to 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in manufacturing climbed 10.2 percent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
On the domestic sales market, the capital goods sector recorded the highest price increase in August (0.7 percent).
Prices in the manufacturing sectors for consumer goods rose by 0.3 percent, while in the energy and processing sectors they remained unchanged compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 was observed in the energy and re-use sector (16.8 percent).
Price increases of 6.8 percent were recorded in the consumer goods manufacturing sectors and 1.4 percent in fixed assets.
Industrial export prices, measured in forints, rose 1.1 percent in August compared with the previous month, but were down 3.9 percent year-on-year.
The domestic currency weakened by 1.7% against the euro, by 7.1% against the dollar, and compared to the August 2007 exchange rate, it strengthened by 7.5% against the euro and by 15.9% against the dollar.
No more visas to the USA from 2009?
Kinga G√∂ncz sees a good chance that the US-Hungarian visa agreement will enter into force on 12 January, as the Foreign Minister explained to representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her view, "everything now depends only on whether the electronic immigration and control system is put in place in time overseas."
She also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists will have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is conducting negotiations in Washington from today.
She will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, to whom she will present the Republic of Hungary's "Cross of Merit with Star," and she will also hold talks with foreign policy advisors to Democrat Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bank bailout
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support on Sunday for the $700 billion bailout of banks, but there are also politicians who are calling for the resignation of the treasury secretary.
Congress and administration officials announced Sunday morning that they had reached an agreement on the bank bailout after days of marathon deliberations.
The crisis on Wall Street and the thawing of the frozen credit market became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than their respective opponents at guiding the country out of the economic crisis.
Recent polls have shown Obama widening his lead on economic issues, while McCain's high, boosted by the presentation of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican convention, has also melted away.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress will quickly pass legislation on the $700 billion package.
He emphasized that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he helped support.
"We must act now, and we must act responsibly... Your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are under threat," he told an audience of 35,000.
He has not failed to call McCain's economic vision "obsolete."
In an interview given to ABC, McCain said, "We're all going to have a hard time of it... but doing nothing is certainly not an option."
The Republican senator said the plan also calls for the creation of an oversight commission for the Treasury secretary, as well as limiting the number of departures for top executives - something he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, while Obama was in contact with the secretary of state.
On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right is intact, only the voters within the camp have become more self-confident - this is how Der Spiegel comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to govern in order to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-leaning German news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the CSU's dramatic defeat in his article "Bavaria's revolution exterminates its fathers."
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christians have renewed Bavaria for decades - now it is the modern citizens who are turning their backs on them.
The rupture of the epoch is at the same time a problem for Christian Democracy, as for Angela Merkel.
The CSU's disaster did not come as a complete surprise, but on Sunday something came to an end that was already apparent almost exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU reached 47.7 percent, falling below the 50 percent mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 federal elections, thus still in the much-quoted Stoiber era.
The modernisation consistently pursued by the CSU in the federal state has, in the end, wiped out its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but misjudged themselves considerably in the process. However, secularization, educational success and the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain without an impact on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernisation always goes hand in hand with an increase in options, and that has political consequences.
The right is intact - only the voters within the camp have become more critical and opinionated.
What is striking is that in recent weeks, the classical civic groups have expressed the greatest distance from the CSU: the liberal professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voters with high school and university degrees.
Here the support of the CSU dropped to even less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who with whom? Party leaders restrained in coalition issues," the conservative Vienna daily reports on the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria following the new elections.
The SP√ñ wants to negotiate with the √ñVP.
The √ñVP prohibits itself from interfering in internal affairs of the SP√ñ.
The BZ√ñ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to commit themselves to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now the focus is on the coalition; in the debates on public television, party leaders have barely looked at their cards.
SP√ñ leader Werner Faymann reiterated his desire to negotiate with the √ñVP.
The SP√ñ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible - this is already the case in some federal states and in the social partnership.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could envisage a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current head of the √ñVP as vice-chancellor.
He said the electorate had voted to leave the EU.
A repetition of this approach would be out of the question.
Molterer, meanwhile, has reacted cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tried to interfere in the internal concerns of the √ñVP.
Whether his party goes into opposition or into the coalition is currently completely open, and these questions should be discussed internally by the √ñVP.
BZ√ñ CEO J√∂rg Haider was open in all directions.
"In order to prevent red and black, we are ready to assume government responsibility," Haider said.
J√°r√≥ka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which this year will be hosted by France, the country holding the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, has begun in Paris.
In her speech to the plenary session, L√≠via J√°r√≥ka, Fidesz member of the European People's Party, drew particular attention to educational segregation, which is one of the most serious violations of the rights of Roma children, and is also the biggest obstacle to their need for validity.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Participants included representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and citizens' organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As reported by the press office of Fidesz MEPs, J√°r√≥ka pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in the search for jobs, Roma are being pushed out of the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma young people have no secondary education and, thanks to poor primary education, only a small proportion of them are able to attain a university degree."
J√°r√≥ka also stressed that education is a fundamental human right, which has a key role to play in asserting other human rights.
Investments in the early education of Roma children could strengthen the economies of the EU member states.
In the opinion of MEPs, it is important that the broadest possible circle - Roma and non-Roma - should become aware of these connections.
Indeed, the earlier a Roma student starts school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labor market; and, through income tax and value-added tax, he or she contributes to national expenditures.
"As EU citizens, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to quality education - the poor and segregated education must cease," said L√≠via J√°r√≥ka.
As the honourable Member said, a common, targeted and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary in order to speed up the process of desegregation in the education sector, for which proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens," J√°r√≥ka said.
Since the congress in Berlin last year, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for advancing the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European as well as national level, in the spirit of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities."
CSU: Time for grace
The fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the election debacle, no heads are rolling for the time being, and the personnel debates at the top of the Bavarian CSU have been postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their posts, the only question is how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent loss of votes will be decided on the last weekend of October at the extraordinary party congress.
However, the much-maligned duo have already hinted that they don't want to stick around in their armchairs.
In doing so, they want to placate the disgruntled faction and the party base, who demanded personal consequences the day after the "Bavarian tsunami" in the face of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who was at the height of his career - the Christian Social Union still reached 60.7 percent. Now, however, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they could secure only 43.4 percent of the vote.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "lone" government in Bavaria, which accounts for 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
Although the conservatives remain the dominant force in the southern federal state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to govern in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the party's internal restructuring, Huber's potential successor, Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, will also be involved in the fact-finding team that is conducting exploratory talks with the liberal FDP and the right-wing "Free Voters" about a possible Munich coalition.
It is an irony of fate that with the list of "Free Voters" Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-Stoiber appearance the Huber-Beckstein duo first exploited, only to mercilessly dismiss the single-minded politician.
The CSU leadership is now concentrating all its energies on stabilising Beckstein.
Stoiber, who has so far pulled the strings from the background, will play an active role in this transition process, with the former prime minister and CSU chairman calling 28 September the "bitterest day of his political career."
On Monday, Huber made a few poisonous remarks directed at the CDU - in his view, the CSU deserved far more support from its sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU, and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed much to its success at the national level in 2005, is not put back on its feet with a joint show of strength, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor again after the federal elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no secret of her disappointment at the fiasco, believes the CSU's loss of ground will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be any easier to govern, while the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In Sunday's elections, no opposition MP made it into the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers say this is due to prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects illegality in the vote count.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the legislature of the state of 10 million inhabitants has managed without opposition for decades, the opposition party, known as the United Democratic Forces (ODS), had earnestly hoped before yesterday's elections that Lukashenko, who renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time in the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, would this time "allow" some opposition MPs in parliament.
That is why the ODS has even refrained from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming economically more dependent on Russia due to rising gas import prices. Indeed, loans have been taken out to alleviate the price increases, and the country has also agreed to sell Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline running through the country, to the Russians. Thus, the opposition's expectations were based on the hope that Ukraine would want to improve its relations with the EU after Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians were banned from entering the EU because of the political system deemed anti-democratic.
A temporary easing of tensions was provided by the OECD Electoral Review, which emphasised positive movements rather than deficiencies, such as the exclusion of a third of opposition candidates from the elections.
However, as early as Monday, the OECD's rapid report criticised the campaign - according to which opponents should not appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present during the vote count.
Despite all this, the opposition is seeing an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, for example, and Minsk is willing to engage in even minor confrontations with Moscow by continuing to refuse to recognize the independence of Georgia's breakaway provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on paper, has considered the two territories independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkevich told our paper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, a continuation is desirable, even though "the powerful have become afraid to let even one opposition member into parliament."
The opposition is not planning to protest at the results, but rather is trying to make the need for economic reform clear to voters.
"We have many problems here - opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, local authorities are putting obstacles in our way in distributing them, but I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the elderly," Milinkevich said, alluding to the fact that not even the most supported section of pensioners agree with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the establishment of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the widening trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before" social security, "reminiscent of a cemetery, begins to crumble," Milinkevich said.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Ria Novosti news agency: "People believe in actions, not words." The absence of opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on we will have breakfast before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi there are revolving doors for the entrances and exits of officials.
From today, the measure will come into force against those who first stamp and then go out drinking coffee during working hours.
The new "Anti-Sloth Law" was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
">" Hinged doors are a means to increase work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services, "said Minister Brunetta.
"A new era of responsibility and transparency is now beginning.
This is reformism, "Brunetta stresses once again.
Palazzo Chigi marks the end of the installation in all buildings of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of revolving doors is also of great symbolic value."
There was no resistance on the part of the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, there is now no breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7am works wonders."
During a meeting of the Superior Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
of Rome, the Minister announces that "in three months the absence of civil servants has been reduced to 50%, that is to say 60,000 more people per year are present at work."
He adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the Italian public administration
"Their wage dynamics," the minister said, "have been twice the size of the private sector over the last 8-10 years and well above the rate of inflation."
Meanwhile, thousands of civil servants have joined forces to oppose the Brunetta decree as part of the Codacons-backed appeal.
"While the minister for the public service is making his mark with figures about lower absenteeism at work," the consumer group writes, the "active sloth" population continues to grow.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants have come together to declare war on the illegal norms of the decree. "
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, including the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker during which inspection visits can be made, and other aspects of the Minister's innovations.
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents at work is crucial"
Every day in Italy, 2500 accidents occur at work, three people die and 27 remain disabled for life.
For the year 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the number of fatal accidents at work was about 1200.
These figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murder.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will celebrate the 58th National Day for the Victims of Occupational Accidents in all the provinces of Italy in order to draw the attention of social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The alarming data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention in the workplace is," confirms the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Association of National Mutilati ed Invalidi del Lavoro (Amil) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention in the workplace, to the protection of injured workers, to aid the families of the victims and to raising public awareness."
"An indignant" Basta "has risen to the occasion, understandable in the case of tragedies which, in terms of their magnitude, cause quite a stir in the media and public sympathy. However, everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events which, in their own dynamic, can even repeat themselves."
Napolitano does not hide the fact that "there is definitely a resource problem: there must be decisive investment in education and information."
Particular importance is attached to the numerous initiatives aimed at raising the awareness of young people in the world of work within the framework of schools.
It is our duty to draw attention to this phenomenon and not to divert attention from its social seriousness; a legislative standard must be put into effect and improved.
For his part, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency that insults the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards firm rules aimed at putting an end to the problem."
"The data on occupational accidents seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," stresses President of Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this" positive trend "to mean less attention, which is what ultimately causes the tragedy."
"We believe that we are actually doing too little to confront the phenomenon of accidents, and we can fight against it through various actions.
Stronger controls and inspections are needed, Mercandelli said, but also stronger measures to educate workers starting at school. "
"A further effort is needed - he adds - in terms of communication and public awareness.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that constitutes a social emergency is needed. "
Mercandelli also referred to "the progressive deterioration of protection for the victims of labour accidents" and denounced the "abolition of the social security system that we have been fighting against in recent years."
"The aim is therefore to return to the worker a guarantee of insurance, so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or accidental donations, which are decided from time to time by a legislator."
MP3 player under indictment: danger of hearing damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as MP3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which, in a report circulated today in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on Current and Recently Identified Health Risks) of the EU.
"It is clear from the report that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music with portable music devices for more than an hour a day for at least five years risk permanent loss of hearing."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people, who usually turn portable music devices and mobile phones to a high volume, are irretrievably damaging their hearing without knowing it," said Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific evidence," the EU said, "shows a clear risk and urges swift action.
What really matters is to raise consumer awareness and make this information a common good.
In the light of this scientific evidence, we need to re-examine existing control systems to ensure they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology. "
Brussels had asked the independent scientific committee to investigate the widespread use of portable music devices among young people.
"The EU Communication concludes that there is legitimate concern and that the European Commission, together with the other EU Members and stakeholders, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise coming from portable music devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard that limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB, and there is concern about the damage that too much noise could cause.
This damage can be very limited by resorting to solutions such as reducing the volume and the length of the noise exposure.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the European Union points out that if the users of portable music devices listen to loud music for only five hours a week (louder than 89 decibels), the legal limits that apply to the maximum noise level at work are already exceeded.
Those who exceed this limit risk complete loss of hearing within five years.
This would therefore affect 5-10% of users of such devices, which can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno launch "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We start today, in March it is supposed to be over, in June we will take stock.
This is the schedule set by the Capitol for the work of the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome, which met this morning in the new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months' time, President Marzano and the other 49 Commissioners will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the city and municipal councils will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able, in June, to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is completely independent and represents all political, social and cultural opinions," - emphasizes Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, the political responsibility of which will remain the city council and the municipal council.
There is no redistribution of competences, only the desire to have a place where a great project for Rome can be developed.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will disband, as such a project must have a definite end point.
In June, the Mayor announces, we will present the strategic plan, in which we will take advantage of the work done by the Commission. "
To those who question the competence of the Commission, since their opinion lacks binding force, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers high-quality results - and this will certainly be the case in Rome - then its contribution will be fundamental.
Politicians too often deal with the everyday problems and emergencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to look at a longer period in order to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective. "
The Mayor of Rome is keen to clarify that "this Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a penny and it will make us think; it will employ the best minds in the capital."
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static, in order to enable our city to make a qualitative leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a common step into the future."
A future, said the Mayor of Rome, that "will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further," not only in terms of Rome's role as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean. "
Obama - the first anti-American president? Here is a statement
A well-known American politician, who cares a lot about being seen as an independent, has written: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the US economy through his decisions, and who cultivated relations with enemy Islam (and still does so today as a private citizen). "
Attacks on Obama are becoming more intense just as the election approaches.
One lady from Miami wrote on an internet site: 'This person is full of ambition.
Obama is very cheeky: he thinks he's going to get the highest office in a nation that's seen two black governors and five black senators in total! '
Actually, these attacks don't have much to say; they are racist attacks and they don't answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win by a big margin.
In this case, too, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: only in the voting booth will we know who the real American patriot will vote for.
This reveals a US mentality that has been hidden until the very end.
"Say what you want, and we'll decide who we're going to cross for, whether it's Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before - only now that the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the ultimate weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his time in office? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the butt.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Still, Iraq remains Bush's weak spot for the majority.
Whoever takes his place faces a huge task.
USA. The financial meltdown is also leaving its mark on journalists: you can already feel the cuts in the newspapers, and many accuse the Internet, the "murderer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and mental control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they said they were not really concerned about the overall credibility of the information given to those in charge.
They don't feel as alone as they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
Then there are the big problems caused by the cuts to the newsroom, the room where the editors work to put the paper together.
This is a problem that needs to be solved - according to the journalists interviewed - if we want to prevent traditional journalism, as the general public understands it, from shrinking substantially.
A clear but complicated pessimism fills the American journalist today.
Six out of ten journalists and senior executives in the printing press believe that journalism at a national level is on the wrong track.
In the local area, the percentage of executives is as high as 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine where the web is headed.
The main publishing groups are making their way onto the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they wanted to embrace the new technology in the hope that "it would bring something good to journalism."
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between the editors-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of editors-in-chief at the national level are sure their reporters share their values, compared to only 23% at the local level.
Some think it has to do with "safety at work."
The number of managers who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years is 47% nationally.
Among journalists, the figure is 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in a team (our "editors," ed.) is always a hot topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists are under contract.
In a huge nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and Internet operators, employers offer what they like and so it becomes a matter of take it or leave it.
The editors-in-chief very often receive very high salaries, but the editor can sometimes only get 10,000 euros per month, plus pension and insurance money.
As far as holidays are concerned, things get complicated: a certain number of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, and finally, after a certain number of years, 15 days of holidays.
But American journalists, by their own admission, often get "sick" over the course of the year.
It is a question of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the application of the real estate agent, who had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy as part of the investigation into the counteragreement in the case of the takeover of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial of him last week, his release from house arrest was commuted to a stay in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to move from the provincial town to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (opposed by the public prosecutor's office) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and obtain evidence against him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon was revealed a few days ago, when the House of Representatives voted against the White House's $700 billion austerity package: a large portion of Americans were, and still are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's edition of the New York Times, which reports on how the crisis is gradually dividing the Republican Party, which is increasingly split into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favored state institutions and the business community, and the neoconservative party, which is hostile to "those in Washington" and the financial world, and which wins voters, especially in the South and the center of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise primarily to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This example I have just mentioned, however, is only a small part of the great changes that the current economic earthquake is heralding or is already heralding: not only in the United States, but also in the whole of the West and perhaps beyond, will be affected by them.
Both in the States and in Europe, the crisis seems to be accelerating the long-feared events that are finally taking shape and coming to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state in conjunction with a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means the demise of banking and financial institutions, which have close links with foreign countries and, at the same time, manage an enormous amount of the wealth of households residing in a single state.
This poses an immediate political problem for governments: how to deal with the families affected, who are also a huge number of voters.
The crisis thus appears to be global in economic terms, while it is almost purely national in political terms.
Political internationalism seems to have thus been sidelined and lost its right to speak: the obvious proof of this has been provided by the EU, which, due to its dichotomy into various national and international conflicts, cannot find a common path.
Therefore, everyone is now counting on the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and above all the distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis became more and more serious, only the US is able to save itself economically without foreign help.
And in addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus, two preconditions that cannot be overestimated - under certain circumstances - that no international organization and no market will otherwise be able to fall back on in a similar way.
This new emphasis on the state-national element is, moreover, perfectly in line with the ever-increasing importance recently attached to an intimately related sector in the economy: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is precisely now, when we were so convinced that we had long since entered a networked global empire, a realm of increasingly differentiated technologies, of the immaterial, that we suddenly have to realize how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
These can certainly all be transported from one place to another in the world, but they are nevertheless extremely connected to a narrowly defined piece of earth - a territory.
Therefore, one who has such a territory has an advantage over another who lives in an area without crops, without water or without oil.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a short insertion.
Who says territory, who says government, who says politics, means leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to be generating two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to manage things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation against the existing leaderships, especially those of economics, which have turned out to be inadequate and full of shadowy areas.
Finally, there is a deeper and, in a certain sense, even more disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, an intolerance, an image of impracticality, a sense of distance, all directed at an entire class of Western managers.
There seems to be a conviction among large sections of the population that it is not only the actions of the social elite but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, the content of which is becoming increasingly foreign and outdated to the majority.
The demand for leadership, then, is feeding an underground ramified but powerful movement for the disempowerment of the ruling class and the traditional political establishment, manifested in unforeseen "revolts" by voters and in the sudden reversal of the collective state of mind of recent times: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, through the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, to the rebellion of American lawmakers against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy also plays a role here).
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual believers, some would say their format, have more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value with regard to what is happening in the lower social strata of the West today, which is being intensified and driven to the point of superdimension by the financial crisis.
In view of all this, it would be simply an exaggeration to speak of a "mass rebellion."
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not the answer.
The super glue that makes walls go up
Defeat the forces of gravity with an adhesive and climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which now seems to be close to achieving its goal.
Using an adhesive applied to an area of just 2.5 square centimetres, the researchers succeeded in fixing a body weighing 100 kg on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO - an American journal has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of the glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged in a stack of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered in microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect grip.
Tests on various materials such as glass, Teflon and sandpaper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the reptiles "feet and" easily removes from the wall, "said Liming Dai, a researcher in the University of Dayton's Department of Engineering.
ALONG WALL? "This material could be used as a transient glue," adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to climb up walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but the researchers are thinking of a less intriguing use, such as connecting electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Further fields of application could be in the field of space travel.
So for now, the superheroes will have to wait.
THE OTHER KIND OF RESEARCH - The University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicating itself to a new type of glue.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present an adhesive made of microfibres that, like hair, clean themselves of dust by moving on a surface, thereby maintaining perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer due to their refreshing quality and rich in vitamins, can cause serious health damage if taken at the same time as certain vital medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points out the risk of packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with medication. At the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he sounded the alarm again: a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is enough to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital drugs to the point where they are virtually eliminated, thus endangering the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs, such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytics and neurological drugs, to toxic levels.
MEDICINES IN DANGER - The same drug agency warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mix in a report two years ago, stressing the importance of paying attention to what is consumed in conjunction with drugs such as diazepan or metadone.
IT IS NOT just GRAPEFRUIT - According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the drugs.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, Director of the Universit√† Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers, who are free to modify consumer information.
Therefore it is advisable to always read the package insert and, if there are still ambiguities, not to be afraid to ask a pharmacist or doctor, "stresses the expert of the Ansa agency.
Nobel economics prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics is awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the establishment of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for The New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policies.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more decisive for US history than the attacks.
A prediction that received quite a bit of controversy as an answer and was put to the economist years later, but now proves to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals of the Enron or Worldcom collapses has disappeared from public view," Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the European Central Bank's Executive Committee, Krugman is an "economist of great value," but also a trivializer with a "very aggressive style, especially against the Bush administration's excessive liberalism."
Open Office, it will release the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has arrived; the open source software as a free replacement for Microsoft Office is gaining an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which is supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself to the public with some novelties: in addition to a revised and now more sparse designed start menu, now finally a thoroughly guaranteed compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version, is given.
Eight has also been added to the compatibility with Microsoft Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Interesting are also some new features, such as the ability to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes it easier to send via email, as well as the ability to import PDF files into graphics editing modules while preserving the original appearance of the page.
In this way, "hybrid" PDF files can now be generated, which add the elements of a table and a word processing system to the typical graphic of the Adobe format.
Collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited by multiple users, avoiding conflicts in case of changes; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a color to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are currently in the process of publishing various functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result will be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download at: http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.html. So it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Apart from Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can have the installation CD sent to your home or office.
While free of charge may be an incentive for the dissemination of the program in private households, it is also in the field of business, where OpenOffice could be a great success: after all, various institutions of public administration and schools have already moved over to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of training, which means optimum help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the text creation program equivalent to Word; Calc, the spreadsheet program that aims to displace Excel; Impress, for creating presentations as with PowerPoint; Dbase, for running databases instead of the more familiar Access; and finally Draw, a graphics module.
The target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads - a target that can easily be exceeded given the 3 million and 600 thousand downloads already achieved.
Kohl also tested positive, making it the fourth doping case
A new doping case is opening up in the context of the last Tour de France: it concerns the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is classified third and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published on L'Equipe newspaper's website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from Team Gerolsteiner is the fourth rider to test positive for Cera, the third-generation Epo. This was previously the case with the Italians Riccardo Ricc√≤ and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from Kohl's blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-samples now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be banned from racing for two years.
Pierre Bordry, the head of the French anti-doping commission, confirmed the positive test and notified the Austrian authorities, according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed onto the podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey for the best climber.
TOPIC IMMIGRATION: NEW YORK TIMES ASKS: IS ITALY RACIST?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants, has recently become one of the favoured countries for immigrants," who are welcomed only reluctantly.
Does this make the Belpaese a nation of racists? This is the question posed by the New York Times in a long article devoted entirely to the issue of racism in Italy, based on the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, a Burkina Faso native, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after stealing a packet of biscuits.
The case bears witness to what The Times calls the "paradox of the North": the northern regions are those where "integration and job opportunities are highest," and yet "the Northern League has the highest level of anti-immigrant sentiment and support."
The Times cites other episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino, and Castel Volturno as confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants.
And not only that.
The new anti-immigration legislation introduced by the League and speeding up the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement which the Pope and the President of the Republic also underline: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting on the Quirinal for cooperation between Church and State in the fight against racism."
Female students are victims of high rents of up to 900 euros per room
The student housing market is not in crisis.
According to the latest research by Sunia, the tenants "union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious characteristics, which means that large numbers of students are effectively losing their right to study because their families are unable to support them at this level" - Laura Mariani, head of Sunia - "in these cities, the great demand on the part of students leads to a distortion of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, no rent limit, unauthorized sublets.
For Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures which, through a revision of taxation, will lead to lower rental prices.
A closer look reveals that in Milan, a place to sleep in the Brianza district costs around 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends at 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera districts, or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, an average bed costs 350 / 400 euros, and a room costs 700 euros.
In Bologna, where the students are concentrated in the neighbourhoods around the university, 250 / 280 euros are needed for a place to sleep, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, prices in the neighbourhoods around the university are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 euros for sleeping in a double room.
Rents are only slightly lower in the neighbourhoods around Rome's other universities: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecitt√†.
Only those who move to the outskirts can save money: 300 euros for a place to sleep and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they carry more weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: rents that are 25-30% above average are demanded by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso - the cities close their historic cinemas
The historic cinemas are closing due to the favoured multiplex cinemas.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture by the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the major urban centres of Italy, as well as in the provinces.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multihall complexes on the periphery, means, in the long run, death for the one-room cinema in the centre. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also bears the hallmarks of a cultural crime.
Historical places full of memories are often affected. "It's like losing a friend with whom you have travelled a part of the road full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso," which won him the Oscar and the Cannes Grand Prix 20 years ago. It is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a cinema world that has probably been lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the central trade association, speak for themselves: in the last five years, an enormous number of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; the majority of these have been paid for by cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the worst affected regions are Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is in these three regions that the greatest number of these modern cinemas have been registered: Lombardy tops the lists with 195 in the last 5 years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "while it is useful that new structures are emerging, the most important thing is to preserve what already exists, because if a hall closes in the city, not all of its regular customers are willing to go to a multiplex cinema on the periphery instead of the old one.
And there is still the lack of a budget for the Outer Eight trade association's fund: the debt burden recorded by the state is around 10 million euros.
It is a disgrace from an ethical and moral point of view that the government does not observe the existing laws.
Maintaining the sector would require between ‚Ç¨16 million and ‚Ç¨18 million a year. "
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to decide to protect the old cinemas through an agreement between the Municipality and Anec, the first agreement of its kind in Italy to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
Among the measures envisaged are also tax advantages for cinema operators and advantages for the public in terms of public transport: it will be possible to travel to restricted areas of the centre and also to park at cheaper rates.
"It is a welcome initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow our lead and also come up with new concepts.
Of course, we also need better audio and video equipment in order to be able to take action against the superpower of multiplex halls, because today's audiences are, after all, more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso," even though I had been toying with the idea for ten years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years; when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside so as not to see the dusty posters.
The links between politics and the 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group.
The charges brought by the Calabria Antimafia Office against the Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia activities, are serious.
Also handcuffed was Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the clan boss, had already been convicted of involvement in criminal mafia associations, at that time to a compensation sum of 10 million euros.
"Ignoring any kind of moral or legal norm," the lawyers write, "the two local administrations had decided to pay Piromalli money for consultancy activities."
"Thus, the mafia group had been allowed - according to the judges - to enter the town halls in an official way and to have a say in the politics of the public administration."
The President of the Calabria Regional Committee Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to come across links between local authorities and organised crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others, where such links are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who are given a white vest.'
This morning's arrests follow those of last July, when police say the Piromalli clan was beheaded.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 - and even then due to alleged links between organized crime and the local administration - the local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the centre-right coalition after the run-off election in May 2006.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He then charged Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, whom he accused of having invented everything for political and strategic reasons, but the judges declare, in connection with this morning's arrest warrant, that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request an amendment to the A3 project.
An eavesdropping operation in connection with the investigation into the Dal Torrione case has shown a willingness to accommodate the wishes of a businessman who, as we know, is a representative of the large Piromalli group - which has made the actions of the public administration identical to the interests of this clan.

When the energy springs from the waves, the big ones suddenly rise up
It is an inexhaustible source of money covering more than 70% of the planet's surface, and only now do the world's major energy companies seem to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is now looking to, and also seeking to occupy, giants such as Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and studied for 70 years; it is no coincidence that these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil plummeted around 1980, the idea of ocean energy was abandoned, but now environmental organizations and the rising price of oil are pushing for new impetus in the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world's energy needs could be met by energy generated by ocean waves.
This would amount to double the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
Then there are the currents and tides.
Giants in attack.
The first company to focus on ocean energy is Enersis, which signed a contract in 2005 to build a power plant in northern Portugal.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy sector are focusing on marine energy generation.
"Chevron is investigating these technologies," a spokesman for a company known to the US giant told the Wall Street Journal, "and is weighing the possibility of working with us."
This involves obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign that should not be underestimated, especially when one considers that oil is still being extracted by the United States, especially in Alaska, and that President Bush only recently initiated plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; although the details are not known, observers say interest is growing.
Technologies still in need of improvement.
Experts speak of a technology that is still on the rise, not least because the last doubts on the part of environmentalists have not yet been resolved.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland have been rather small in scale and do not appear to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, large-scale energy production requires technologies that have a far greater impact on the environment.
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the floats via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn drives a generator.
The electricity is then sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four planned plants of this type, which are only awaiting government approval, and some of the energy could also be used for military installations.
Verdant Power, meanwhile, is already producing power for a department store and parking lot using submarine turbines in New York's East River.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotary motion.
According to Verdant, there is already a long queue of potential clients waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Generation Research, the potential of the tides is of particular interest at the moment.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are more predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is tidal energy in particular that has led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, to invest 7.5 million dollars in 2008 - with up to 35 million already planned for 2009.
