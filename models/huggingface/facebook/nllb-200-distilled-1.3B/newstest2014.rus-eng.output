Two men in Kineshma and the area committed suicide
One of the hanged had previously attempted suicide.
On October 30, at around 1:00, a man in the village of Lugovoye committed suicide by hanging himself.
It is known that he has previously attempted suicide.
What prompted the man to take such a step is unknown.
On October 31st, at 11-50, a 41-year-old man from Kineshma hanged himself at his home.
No signs of violent death have been found, the Kineshemsky press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs reports.
You have a black box in your car?
As American road designers struggle to find the money to fix the crumbling highway system, many are starting to see the solution in a little black box neatly attached to the dashboard of your car.
These devices, which track every mile driven by a motorist and transmit this information to officials, are at the heart of a controversial effort by Washington and state planning agencies to modernize America's outdated highway funding system.
The normally boring arena of highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying for the government to use small boxes to track your miles and maybe even where you drive them -- and then use that information in tax bills.
The tea party movement is in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of privacy concerns.
And while Congress can't agree on whether to proceed, several states aren't going to wait.
They're thinking about how, over the next decade, we can move to a system where drivers pay for every mile of road they drive.
Thousands of drivers have already taken to testing these black boxes, some of which have satellite tracking capabilities.
It's really necessary for our country.
"This is not a question we can have a choice in", said Hassan Ihrat, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which is working on plans to start tracking the miles driven by every California motorist by 2025.
There's going to be a change in the way we pay those taxes.
The technology for that already exists.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funding from the Government Highway Fund, funded by the taxes Americans pay at gas stations.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars are going over a mile per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents a gallon, hasn't been raised in 20 years.
Politicians don't want to raise taxes by even a cent with high gasoline prices.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable", said Lee Mannich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed 500 tracking devices on cars to test the faulty payment system.
"It will be the best alternative in the long term", he said.
The Zanuans call it a false user fee.
It's no surprise that this idea appeals to urban liberals, because taxes can change the nature of travel to reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
California planning authorities are looking at this system as they develop strategies to meet the targets set by the state's ambitious global warming laws.
However, House Representative Bill Shuster (R-Penn.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he too sees the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free market advocates at the Reason foundation are also excited about making drivers pay for every mile.
"This is not just a tax that will go into the black hole", said Adrian Moore, Reason's vice president of policy.
People pay directly for what they get.
This move is also supported by two former U.S. transportation secretaries who in 2011 urged Congress to move toward a mistrial.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would involve about 10,000 cars.
House leaders, however, rejected the proposal because of concerns from rural lawmakers who represent voters who often travel many miles to work or the city in their daily lives.
A few states and cities, however, are going down this path on their own.
The biggest enthusiasm is in Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are taking part in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon be paying the state mileage instead of gas tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project is already complete.
He's being processed in New York.
Illinois is testing it on a limited basis with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes transportation departments from 17 states along the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is exploring how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently fitted with the devices, drivers were concerned that the government might be tracking their every move.
"Concerns about big brother and stuff like that are a big problem", said Alauddin Khan, director of strategy and efficiency management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't what people wanted.
As the trials were in full swing, the Nevada chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union warned on its website: "It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-scale surveillance devices".
There is no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to store records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of the few states that is struggling to find low-cost technology that would allow state authorities to keep track of vehicle miles driven without information about time and place.
If you can do that, Khan said, society will feel more at ease.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small, young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, this company was not involved in assisting in the collection of state taxes.
It was an attempt to enter the emerging market for a form of auto insurance where drivers pay on a mileage basis.
But the devices she's testing are attractive to road designers because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information that's periodically downloaded by the modem.
"People will be more likely to do this if you don't track their speed and track their location", said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
There were some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with giving drivers a variety of options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can opt out of the device altogether, choosing instead to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage of all residents in the state.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea to a vigilant public by making the devices do more, not less.
In New York City, transportation officials are working to develop a taxing device that would also accept payment from parking meters, provide "pay as you go" insurance, and collect a real-time pool of speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
Automotive owners will be attracted to the benefits they are offered,  says the urban planning document.
Some transportation system designers, however, wonder if all the talk of mispayment is just a huge distraction.
At the San Francisco Bay Area Municipal Transportation Commission, officials say Congress could easily overcome the bankruptcy of the Highway Construction Trust Fund by raising gasoline taxes.
An additional one-off or annual tax could be levied on drivers of hybrid cars and others whose vehicles do not use much gasoline to pay their fair share.
"There's no need for radical surgery when all you have to do is take aspirin", said Randy Rentschler, director of the Commission on Legislation and Public Relations.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will have to worry about their privacy and a whole host of other things.
EU prepares measures to support Ukraine in case of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a back-up plan to supply Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius summit.
The IMF is in talks for a stand-by loan, and another EU official directly involved in the talks added that they aim to conclude an agreement soon.
In addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine could receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts polled by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome longstanding disagreements over funding terms.
The international rating agency S&P, which on Friday downgraded Ukraine's sovereign rating to one degree - "B-" with "B", also does not believe in the possibility of reforms needed to obtain aid.
However, EU officials say the IMF can be flexible in lending terms, taking into account Ukraine's circumstances.
In addition to the country's financial support plan, the EU has a backup option to supply Ukraine with gas, the bulk of which now comes from Russia.
Maybe it's gas from Nord Stream or reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, officials say, is the most likely and acceptable way to deal with Russia's "isolation" of Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reverse supply to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and will likely lead to a decrease in supplies to other regions.
"EU countries and Ukrainians are negotiating how to create favorable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes", the source added.
Russia is out of the fight against car pollution
Attempts to solve the transport problems of large cities have been observed in most of the world's megacities since the second half of the 20th century.
The idea was to either rebuild and expand the highways or to reduce the demand for car travel, the number of cars and the time spent on them.
The example of Singapore is well known, where a strict quota is imposed on the growth of the number of private cars, and the right to purchase them is bought at auctions.
It may cost two or three times as much as the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced a city-centre toll.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are being introduced, where only cars with a certain eco-class are allowed to enter, which also use high-quality fuel (including biofuel or electric vehicles).
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a "five-year clean air plan" in 2012 at a total cost of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
Li Kunsheng, director of the Transport Pollution Control Department of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, told Kommersant that the five-year plan's main goal is to reduce the world's top air pollutants by 20-35 percent by 2017, increase the number of private cars to no more than 6 million (now 5.2 million), and increase fuel consumption per vehicle by no more than 5 percent.
According to the agency, motor vehicles are now responsible for 22.5 percent of Beijing's total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the program are the restriction of the use of automobile transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the city's measures of the "green five-year plan" include an accelerated transition to Eurofuel standards compared to the rest of the country, the introduction of a local system of eco-standards and marking of cars and fuel, restricting the entry of cars into the central part of the city, a ban on the use of obsolete vehicles (in addition, the creation of incentive financial programs to replace old cars with hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and service), the development of public transport (including high-speed).
Beijing's automotive innovations also include a ban on all private cars to drive within the fifth transport ring (there are six in the capital of China) one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the vehicle's license plate), as well as issuing registration marks for cars based on a lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private cars in Beijing was only a third of the number in 2010).
According to the current state program "Environmental Protection for 2012-2020", the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Nature, in 2011 "moving sources" accounted for 41% of all pollutant emissions into the atmosphere in cities.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than those from industry, and in St. Petersburg, nine times higher.
In Russia, people are just beginning to think about the possibility of restricting the use of cars on city streets.
The director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the HSE, Mikhail Blinkin, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for car trips are obviously unpopular, and can only be accepted by society if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, a unique problem arises with the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters of vehicles that are not sensitive to any regulatory effects - service and personal cars, as well as cars of "privileged" users, the total number of which is at least 200 thousand (about 5% of the total number of vehicles in Moscow).
Recently, urban planners at the ECOM Centre in St. Petersburg prepared a study that analyses the balance of urban areas between housing, road surface and traffic.
The main findings of the researchers are that the city centre is twice as busy as it needs to be, and most of the city's motorists do not use their cars every day, leaving them in parking lots or on the streets for long periods of time.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking lots, but storage facilities for cars, not to expand, but to reduce the traffic portion (so that the streets become more friendly for pedestrians), as well as to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the boundaries of the protected area of the historic center (the total area is about 3212 hectares, covering a number of central areas of the city).
Fines for street trading in Vologda will increase
The city authorities believe that increasing the fines will help to bring order to Vologda and free the streets from the natural tents and trays.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, and the products they sell are often not properly inspected.
And that means the health of the Vologans is at risk.
So, the lower limit of fines for citizens for unauthorized trade will increase six times from November - from 500 to 3000 rubles, the press service of the Vologda Administration reports.
Goldman Sachs warned of risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks to the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.
It's primarily the consumer credit default crisis and the massive layoffs.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather the structure of that growth.
Recently, it has been entirely driven by consumption, which is almost not slowing down", said Clemens Graf, chief economist for Russia at Goldman Sachs, presenting the quarterly report of the investment bank on the Russian economy yesterday.
Now the nominal wage growth in Russia is about 10%.
At 6% inflation, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at about current levels, Goldman Sachs expects.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so they will most likely optimize their personnel costs.
Today we see a substantial increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages are growing by 10%, then GDP is only growing by 2%", Mr Graf explained.
Companies have been facing a decline in profitability.
If it doesn't grow, it could lead to layoffs and unemployment.
Russian business cannot afford not to raise wages, comments Vladimir Pantyushyn, chief economist at Barclays Capital in Russia and the CIS.
Unemployment is near historic lows, competition for workers is high.
To attract or retain employees, employers have to raise wages.
Consumption in Russia is also supported by very rapid growth in demand for credit.
In the view of Mr Graf, the extremely high consumer loan rates do not have a multiplier effect on the economy.
"We have not seen any benefit for the economy from the growth of demand for credit, the money is not being spent in the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments", the economist said.
But the problem is, Goldman Sachs is expecting a rise in nonperforming loans.
They're mostly taken by poor people who have nothing to offer in support.
Interest rates on these loans are high.
As a result, they are less likely to be returned", Mr Graf said.
Therefore, the second threat to economic growth in Russia is the possible default crisis on unsecured loans.
The director of the Banking Institute of the HSE, Vasily Solodkov, is already seeing signs of a looming banking crisis.
Small credit institutions, lacking access to cheap resources like those of state banks, were forced to attract public funds at high interest rates.
In response, the state banks went to war and began to lower credit rates, - continues the economist.
Small lenders cannot lend at the same interest rates, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If the state banks do not abandon dumping, Russia is facing a full-fledged banking crisis, Vasiliy Solodkov believes.
The loss of licenses to a number of banks in recent weeks is a harbinger of a massive collapse, the economist said.
"The state banks themselves will not cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis", warns the head of the institute.
But consumption growth will slow even without a default crisis, the investment bank said, because of the refusal to index civil servants and military salaries, as stipulated in the current version of the budget.
The impact on consumption will be partially mitigated by freezing the tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a consequence, lowering inflation).
But only in part: if investment does not increase (and there is no precondition for this yet - see reference), consumption growth will still slow down, Goldman Sachs is confident.
Vladimir Pantyushyn of Barclays Capital sees no prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is the continued fall in oil prices", he says.
He estimates that Russia's economy will start to shrink when oil prices fall below $90 a barrel.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the central bank is not yet in a position to lower interest rates in the economy.
The paradox is that inflation has fallen and banks have started raising rates.
This could mean that they did not believe the Central Bank, which announced the transition to inflation targeting", said Clemens Graf.
The interest rate policy of the Central Bank does not affect market rates, it only affects interbank lending rates.
"For the Central Bank, this is the collapse of all hopes", - said Clemens Graf.
The money raised at the auction is not used by the banks to lend to the economy, but to manage their liquidity.
As soon as the rate drops, the exchange rate changes, which means that the funds are trying to go to speculate against the ruble.
"Sooner or later the Central Bank will realize that this strategy is not working", Mr. Grafe said, and reminded that the state plans to let the ruble into "free float" by the end of 2015.
But he believes that it will have to be done sooner or raise the key rate of the Central Bank (5,5%).
According to him, the ruble is artificially inflated by 10%.
The only way to lose weight is to lose weight, says an expert.
But if the central bank casts even a shadow of doubt in the financiers that the liquidation of the currency corridor is not part of the policy of weakening the ruble, it could collapse the ruble much more strongly.
In Chelyabinsk, the II Congress of the peoples of the South Urals took place.
The forum is dedicated to the Day of National Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
The congress was attended by delegations from all cities and districts of the region, representatives of national-cultural associations, religious confessions, legislative and executive authorities - in total about 350 people.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening interethnic harmony.
We can set an example here, not only for other regions, but also for other countries.
We have no differences.
We live in complete mutual understanding", - claims Theophan, Metropolitan of Chelyabinsk and Zlatoust.
The meeting discussed a number of issues, including patriotism, cultural cooperation.
The congress passed a resolution.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theater.
Here, an exhibition of national-cultural associations of the Chelyabinsk region was opened.
Snowden is willing to cooperate with Germany on U.S. intelligence.
Edward Snowden, a US intelligence whistleblower, has said he is prepared to travel to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander cannot answer questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
The letter from Mr Snowden, which the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: "While the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalise political speech with criminal charges that offer no protection".
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that international support could persuade the U.S. government to drop criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of government property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will find ways to make it possible".
Relations between the United States and Germany have become strained after allegations that the NSA was listening to the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Opperman, the MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing intelligence, said that if there is an opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness, "without endangering him and without completely destroying relations with the US", it should be used.
Mr. Ströbele, a member of parliament for the Green Party of Germany, posted a picture of himself with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strobel said that according to the lawyer for a former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be there "in safety", the MP said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a "severe and persistent" campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said he was encouraged by the global reaction to his political statements.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials  including in the United States , have found the exposure of the uncontrolled system of pervasive surveillance to be beneficial to society.
The letter offers to cooperate with the German authorities once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved.
Frontier Airlines will charge for hand luggage .
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for carrying hand luggage on board their flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, though their announcement on Wednesday said passengers could keep the entire can.
The new hand luggage charge applies to bags in the top luggage compartment, so small bags under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if travelers pay only when they arrive at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee should make passengers pay upfront.
"We don't want to charge for it", she said.
Airlines began charging for the first and second bags in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges pack as much as they can into the carry-on luggage compartments in the upper compartments, often leaving them empty.
Fees are one way to make passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new levy isn't really about making money.
The thing is, Frontier's most loyal customers say it's getting harder to find a seat in the top luggage compartment.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in line at the gate of a Frontier flight can get a free bag, while the next passenger in line can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said the change to procedures on the website and at the Frontier check-in counters is designed to ensure passengers are aware of the fee before they reach the boarding gate.
The new Frontier hand luggage levy won't go into effect until the summer, though a date has yet to be set.
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that baggage handling costs money and that passengers who need this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of flights after years of losses.
However, most of them did not concern hand baggage fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced its first hand luggage levy three years ago, and another Allegiant Air discount carrier later followed suit.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the surcharges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit's hand luggage collection generated $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former top executive at Midwest Airlines, recently flew Spirit, and he was curious to see what he would find at the boarding gate when passengers face the Spirit's unusual hand luggage charge.
"The landing process was the smoothest I've seen in my airline career", he said.
I expected to see teeth grinding and a fight brewing at the landing gate.
The plane was full, he said, and the landing was quick.
Frontier also follows Spirit in terms of the $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier said passengers who receive a soda or juice can keep the whole can and that the coffee will be provided free of charge.
She'll still be giving out free water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but dropped it seven months later after passengers started complaining and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier's initiative to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline is its latest move to attract customers to its website.
Airlines pay online ticket vendors like Orbitz between $10 and $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them instead of going to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further than anyone else in this area.
In September, it began giving twice as many frequent flyer miles to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the premium mileage to 25 percent of the mileage.
So, a 1,000-mile trip from Frontier bought from an online travel agency would give you 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can only book seats in advance if they purchase tickets directly from Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in her hometown of Denver, but her business is shrinking and becoming unprofitable.
Revenue fell 9 percent and flight capacity fell nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the airline sale.
The NSA blames "internal error" not hackers for shutting down the site.
The secretive National Security Agency said Friday night that the outage of their website for several hours was caused by a technical glitch, not hackers as claimed online.
NSA.gov was down for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update, the intelligence agency said in an official email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service attack are false.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems reported that the NSA website had been down for at least six hours, and the site was still inaccessible to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's internal secret network was "not" hacked.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one online hacker activist group has claimed responsibility for taking down the NSA website in a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site goes down.
The tactics of hackers are relatively simple, and the attacks are not designed to penetrate the target system's internal network.
The formerly top-secret NSA, once nicknamed "No Such Agency", has come under public scrutiny and fierce criticism in recent months after a series of revelations about its extensive surveillance programs abroad and at home - all in response to classified NSA files stolen from the agency and released by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the agency has led to speculation that today's incident was the result of deliberate hacker activity.
Bombardier 's profits are down as shipments and orders for aircraft fall .
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported a 15 percent decline in net profit on Thursday, driven by a decline in third-quarter aircraft orders and deliveries and contract problems at its rail division.
Montreal-based Bombardier has also not released any data on flight tests of its latest CSeries aircraft, and has not provided any new information on whether it will meet its ambitious plans to bring the aircraft into commercial service by next September.
The first flight of the prototype aircraft, about a month and a half ago, has only been three times, raising questions about whether the testing phase is on schedule.
The results did not live up to expectations and led to a drop of more than 8 percent in the Toronto Stock Exchange.
National Bank Financial analyst Cameron Doerksen lowered his valuation Thursday from above market average to mid-market based on the belief that stock growth is limited to the next quarter or two.
"While the decline in aircraft deliveries was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the profitability of the transportation sector", Doerksen said in a stock market survey.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to be more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries family will allow it to gain a foothold in the lower-cost segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus now dominate.
The first prototype was presented in March and first flew in September after several months of delay.
However, firm orders for the CSeries are not too many yet as potential buyers are waiting for flight test results to test the company's claims about the fuel efficiency and potential economy of the new liner.
There are now 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Pierre Baudouin was confident that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 firm orders by the time the first aircraft was put into commercial operation.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured analysts and media that the program is moving ahead on schedule.
"The test model did not stay on the ground longer than expected", Bodwan said during a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned while the plane was down.
All manufacturers plan their tests differently.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break for updates, which we did.
This will be the case throughout the flight test program.
The second of the five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks and the rest will soon follow, the company said.
Yet analysts are skeptical of the claim that the first customer will be able to start operating the CSeries 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it was assessing the timing of the commissioning and would provide further information in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing - although it seems to be in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - reinforces our view that the launch will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015", Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ending September 30, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted earnings per share remained at  9 cents.
Gross income dropped slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts were expecting a 10 cent profit per share and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer reported that it delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, down from 57 the previous year.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The Aerospace Division's order book was $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.
"In the aerospace sector, the results were in line with our objectives, but the low number of orders and the general market conditions were a negative factor", said Bodwan.
Gross revenue from the aerospace sector fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, reported that gross revenue in the sector rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The transportation division's order book was $32.6 billion as of September 30, slightly higher than December 31.
The revenues of the transport division were negatively affected by the problems with the execution of several large contracts.
The management said that a new development plan will be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier, which also announced that Google's chief financial officer Patrick Pichett will join the board, fell 8.5 percent to $4.83 in mid-Thursday trading.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest competitor, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly revenue on Thursday.
Sony is expecting a lower annual profit .
Japanese electronics maker Sony Corporation, which ended the quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, cut its profit forecast for the current fiscal year.
Sony's results for the period July to September 2013 were more disappointing than expected, due to a drop in demand for TVs, camcorders and personal computers manufactured by the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, which brought the company its first operating profit in three years in the second quarter of the year of 5.2 billion yen, fell again to 9.3 billion yen in operating losses in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is going through a difficult time, especially due to the decline in demand for TVs.
And while competitors are looking for a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main rivals, Panasonic, has recently shifted its focus to industrial components, where sales are growing at a rapid pace, especially thanks to automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year ending in March 2014, Sony expects to generate 179 billion yen in operating profit against the previously expected 230 billion yen.
According to Thomson Reuters, analysts had expected the figure to be much higher, at 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony expanded its product line.
In the middle of this month, the Japanese company announced the launch of a smartwatch with a number of fashionable features that will eliminate the need to pull out a smartphone 100 times a day.
After Sony lowered its annual earnings and revenue forecast, the company's shares fell more than 11% in the morning opening day in Tokyo, to 1,668 yen per share.
The speech gene was found to stimulate synapse formation .
Scientists at Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai School of Medicine have discovered a protein that enables the "speech gene" Foxp2 to function by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study was published in Science, and you can read a summary of it on the journal's website.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
His role was established in 2001 when a family of several people who could not pronounce words correctly and sometimes even did not understand each other was discovered.
Scientists found that family members had a disrupted Foxp2 gene, but how it works was not known.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of its function is performed by Foxp2 as a stimulator of new synapses in the brain region associated with speech formation.
It does this through another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered by looking for factors that stimulate synapse formation.
SRPX2 was one of 10 such genes found by the authors, with Foxp2 being the only one to have shown its activity.
That SRPX2 does affect vocalization has been confirmed in a mouse experiment.
When the animals were artificially reduced in gene activity, they screamed less when separated from their mothers.
If the gene activity was restored, the frequency of the sounds produced was restored.
Earlier, a link was also shown in mice to the vocalisation of Foxp2 itself.
The animals that were injected with the human copy of the gene ate more actively and at a lower frequency than normal mice.
However, scientists still do not know whether Foxp2 and the SRPX2 it controls are purely mechanical or more subtle.
A cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned a gang leader about a police investigation is in jail
42-year-old Basharat Ditta was passing information to criminal authority figure Neil Scarborough .
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction would be exposed.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
A prominent lawyer who told a drug lord about a major police investigation because he was afraid of exposing his secret drug addiction was sentenced to three years in prison.
42-year-old Basharat Ditta passed classified information to criminal authority Neil Scarborough about his drug-trafficking investigation after he was threatened for his cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed Bash and known to criminals as "The Cool Lawyer", was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police sting operation on Scarborough, whom he had represented in a drug-related trial.
Officers noticed 32-year-old Scarborough leaving three bags of cocaine outside a lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a bar association dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta was a regular Class A drug user after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two people on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were in police custody at the time as part of a major investigation into the activities of a criminal organisation involved in heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later jailed after police seized £1.5m worth of heroin and cocaine in a series of raids, as well as over £200,000 in cash.
42-year-old Ditta was passing information to criminals out of fear that his cocaine addiction would be exposed.
Today at Liverpool Crown Court, Ditta, who works for Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, was shamed after pleading guilty to two counts of willful obstruction of justice following a three-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.
He admitted to cocaine possession in one of the previous court hearings.
The lawyer's exposure came after police investigating Scarborough's activities found that he had been regularly talking to Ditto on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked down the suspect and found him walking into Ditts' Blackburn home and putting 60 percent pure drugs in a black golf glove under the lawyer's trash cans.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarborough made several calls to Ditto, who was at a dinner at Ewood Park Football Stadium, Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer returned home to get the drugs; nine conversations took place between them.
The court found that Ditta was a regular cocaine user after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, said he had spoken to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted their communication was a "lawyer's secret".
During his detention, Ditta took out his wallet and tried to get out several credit cards, but they were all confiscated, and a hair sample was also taken.
When questioned by police, he said that he had a home office and clients who came to his home for legal matters.
However, the court found that after important arrests, he had been calling the major drug traffickers, some of whom he had represented in court, to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
In her deposition, Anne White said, "If anyone knows that you shouldn't break the law, it's a criminal lawyer".
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defense attorney because he has developed a too close relationship with certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his talk will certainly be legitimate, since he was their lawyer.
However, this has gone far beyond the usual lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta has not honored his profession, he has dishonored it.
He's become too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and has allowed his own lack of interest to be questioned.
Dietta pleaded not guilty and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to give information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately".
But after the hearing, senior officer Lee Holstead of Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta went from criminal lawyer to criminal offender once he started buying drugs from organised crime".
His cocaine addiction left him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the goals of major criminal gang members who tasked him with extracting valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to cover it up with his profession.
Mr. Ditt's investigation was led by the Lancashire Highly Dangerous Organized Crime Unit, which has already convicted him of three counts of cocaine possession and now one count of obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to fair punishment for the perpetrators.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and prosecute you.
Sam Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people involved in the scheme were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta has hosted a Q&A session in which he says his dream job is  being a death row lawyer in America, his perfect dinner companion  being Muhammad Ali, and his motivation in the job  being inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready to receive 22 thousand spectators, police officers who attended the meeting of the Russian Federation Police Committee said.
The ticket program is overpriced, they say, by about half.
During the match 1/16 of the final of the Cup of Russia with "Spartacus" was involved only a thousand stewards at the regulatory norm of nine thousand.
Spartak fans were given 2200 seats, or 10 percent of the capacity of the stadium, but, according to the agreement with the Moscow club, they were sold 5 thousand tickets.
This was announced by the head of the KDK Artur Grigoryants.
The Americans were listening to Japanese officials .
On Friday, November 1, a U.S. intelligence official who declined to be named said the United States had been listening to the phone conversations of high-ranking Japanese officials.
This man confirmed that there are several places in the land of the rising sun dedicated to listening.
He noted that the US, UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand do not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
He said it was during World War II, when the two countries were allies.
Japan, like Germany, is a target for intelligence, despite its postwar alliances with the United States, NHK reported.
Officially, neither side has commented on the information.
We'll remind you that the news about the surveillance of the German Chancellor by the US intelligence services came last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA may have been listening to Merkel's phone for the last ten years.
The chancellor herself, according to some reports, took the news of her eavesdropping very painfully.
She said that the allies, which she believes have been Germany and the United States for decades, such an observation of the head of government is unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden said he was willing to share details of Angela Merkel's wiretapping of German prosecutors.
The German flew to Moscow specifically to meet with a former CIA employee.
The country may put grain on the market not before the beginning of 2014
The government intervention in the procurement of grain can put the region on the market not earlier than the beginning of 2014, according to the minister of agriculture of the republic Nikolay Kovalenko.
At present, market prices are such that they do not encourage sales to the intervention fund.
While the market price is higher, there is demand.
"Maybe the grain will be put up for auction after the New Year", he said at a press conference yesterday.
The minister recalled that this year, the seeds of agricultural crops for the 2013 harvest amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including the area of grain crops - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
The 2014 harvest is sown on 550 thousand hectares (by 105 thousand hectares more than in 2012).
The area under the winter wheat and triticale has been increased, the rye has remained at the same level.
There's no "Brotherhood Circle" in the I.A. database, which is where Leps is listed in the U.S.
The Russian security forces' database does not contain the "Brotherhood Circle" group, which Washington has listed as singer Gregory Leps.
As noted by "Interfax" in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after the media reported that the US Ministry of Finance had included Grigory Leps in the control lists for suspected membership in the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brotherhood Circle", all databases were checked, but no such group was found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the myth of the so-called "Russian mafia", which allegedly operates abroad, according to the law enforcement agencies.
"Even the name 'Brotherhood Circle' has an element of mystery, a hint of a secret lodge.
"It's all very much like a PR campaign", the agency said.
The US Treasury Department announced on October 31 that it had added Arthur Badalian, Grigory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergey Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalsky and Igor Shlykov to its watch lists for alleged membership in the Eurasian crime syndicate "Brotherly Circle".
The individuals on the list are suspected of ties to Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on U.S. sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the US authorities, Grigory Leps "serves as a money delivery courier on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev".
Grigory Leps' production center declined to comment on the US accusations against the singer, calling them "crap".
In 2011, US President Barack Obama listed the Brotherhood as a "significant transnational organized crime group" and directed the Treasury Department to "undermine and disrupt their global criminal operations".
Putting a person on the US Treasury blacklist means blocking their assets in the US and banning business contacts with them by anyone living in the States.
Scandalous video got to the police
Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, known for his outrageous and downright reckless antics, has been caught smoking crack.
Police in the Canadian city said they had the video and were ready to investigate the mayor.
He said he would not leave his post, CNN reports.
Information that authorities have evidence of Rob Ford's drug use has appeared on the Toronto Police Department website.
Local law enforcement chief Bill Blair held a press conference about it.
The sheriff said he wasn't authorized to share the footage with the public, but he guaranteed it existed.
According to Blair, the video compromising Rob Ford was discovered during a drug raid by law enforcement officers in the summer of 2013.
The video was reported in the Canadian press earlier, but no confirmation was made until recently.
The mayor himself has no comment on the matter.
He just says he's innocent and he's not going to resign.
The video footage found by police is one of the evidence in the case of Ford's 35-year-old friend Alexander Lissie, who is charged with drug trafficking, extortion, illegal profits and criminal conspiracy.
Sometimes, Lissy was Rob Ford's driver.
The city's residents have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He had repeatedly fought with reporters, appeared in public drunk, and made racist and sexist remarks.
"Rostovaeroinvest" has recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the selection of the general designer of the object.
The amount of the contract at RostovAeroinvest is not disclosed.
According to the press service of the OJSC, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, according to the tender terms, the project should be prepared and sent for state examination in the spring of 2014.
The winner will design the airport's new passenger terminal, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and elements of airport complex improvement.
The first phase of construction will have an internal area of 50 thousand square meters, and it is possible to increase it further.
According to Rostovaeroinvest, the project documentation will take into account the development prospects of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers, and by 2035 - 6 million passengers.
By the time the tender results were drawn up, the architectural concept of the South Airport Complex had been defined by the British company Twelve Architects.
The main terminal building project embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Don and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience in large projects, the company has designed the terminals C and E of the Sheremetyevo International Airport and the new airport terminal complex at the Knevichy International Airport in Vladivostok.
The international airport complex "Southern" will be built in the Asai district of the Rostov region and will replace the existing Rostov airport, which will be closed and integrated into the city development in the future.
Construction of the airport complex is scheduled to start in 2014, and all facilities are scheduled to be commissioned in 2017.
A politician in Turkey has gone on hunger strike against a wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, authorities began building a wall in the area of the city of Nusaybin in southeastern Turkey.
Local residents and pro-Kurdish PMD representatives strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Syrian border city of Nusaybin, Turkey, Ayşe Gekhan, has declared a hunger strike to protest the construction of a wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, the Peace and Democracy Party (PYD) press service reported on Friday.
The police repeatedly dispersed the demonstrations.
Turkish Foreign Minister Muammer Güler initially denied the construction, then said the wall was being built to ensure border security.
"The mayor of Nusaiba, Aisha Geehan, a member of the PMD, has declared a hunger strike, thus turning her protest against the wall into a death struggle", the party's press service said.
The mayor believes the wall is designed to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, as the Kurds have been crossing the border freely for half a century.
"This is an inhuman situation that the Kurds will never accept", said Ayşe Gekhan, a spokesman for the party.
According to the press service, a rally against the construction of the wall is planned in Nusaiba on November 7.
Venezuela to set exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency, the bolivar, against the dollar for tourists.
This was reported by Bloomberg on November 1 with reference to a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange the equivalent of ten thousand U.S. dollars a year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the bolivars purchased in the country at the time of departure.
The exact exchange rate of the bolivar against the dollar will be determined later.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue its currency to 6.3 bolivars per dollar.
However, on the black market, one dollar is valued at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 percent.
Oil Minister and Vice President for Economics Rafael Ramirez said on October 18 that Venezuela had no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to unofficial reports, Caracas may decide to lower the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of restraining prices for food and consumer goods, as well as the high degree of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, led to a shortage of a number of goods and the functioning of a black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported that there was a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
Andrei Belmach, director of the Ugra, said it was difficult to say how long it would take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after Sergei Shepelev resigned.
The resignation took place only a few hours ago, so I am not ready to say how long it will take to find a new coach, - quotes ITAR-TASS the words of Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're looking at all the options.
Priority will be given to a Russian specialist.
We want to find someone who can work with us for a few years and achieve results.
Kenya Press Outraged by Provocative Media Law
It is a terrible place, and there is reason to ask: what can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?,  the newspaper reported, calling the law unconstitutional.
"This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it", said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, the parent company of CapitalFM, which owns one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news website.
He said the new media judiciary "will always be biased as it is an extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us and we ask him to reject this bill and return it to the legislature", he said.
According to The Star, the new law will essentially allow the government to "take the media by the hand", while The Standard reported that Kenya's democracy and free speech "have taken a serious hit" and criticized the bill as "dragon-like".
The bill is part of a larger national security effort after the September Muslim terrorist attack on the Westgate shopping mall.
Kenyan media have angered the authorities by broadcasting surveillance footage of troops who were sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looting an expensive shopping mall.
Police Chief David Kimayo responded by summoning two journalists and a media official for questioning, though the summons was canceled after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishers can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists  up to one million with the additional risk of being  excluded from the lists, i.e. banned from obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the offender's property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to cripple most FM radio stations".
She also said the measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's so-called "vibrant blogosphere".
Politicians realize that by silencing the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know", wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of deterrent and balancing forces in public life.
"Self-sufficient politicians will ruin the country and return us to hunting and gathering", he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public outrage in the past.
In May, they voted to cancel cuts imposed by the National Wage Commission and restore their huge salary of around 532,000 shillings a month, tax free,  one of the highest in the world.
The residents of Voronezh will have a new line of expenses in their utility bills - the capital repair of their house.
According to the most approximate calculations, a standard two-room apartment will cost from 100 to 400 rubles a month from the new year.
The exact norm will be determined by the regional government.
But when to paint the driveway, fix the stairs, or even replace the elevator, the tenants will decide for themselves.
The law was approved by the deputies of the regional Duma.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional Duma, noted: "In this case too, we need to put order - to set the order of repairs, to accumulate funds not in the management companies - which we often register in Moscow, in Orenburg, or elsewhere, this will be the establishment of state control over the spending of funds that residents collect for repairing apartment buildings".
The state now controls the share capital.
The law protecting against fraud was approved by a majority in the final reading.
The document was not born in a vacuum.
In our region, 4,500 people have been affected by dishonest developers.
Most of the problems have been solved.
By the way, the new law specifies rights and responsibilities for all participants in the joint construction.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional Duma, said: "It is no secret that abuses have also started in this sphere, due to the fact that in the year 98 the same shareholders were caught, and in the 2000s the same shareholders".
People started making money off of it to cover the loophole, including passing these two laws.
It was decided to build a temporary residence center for foreign citizens who are subject to deportation near Voronezh.
The provincial parliament did not adopt such a law only under the pressure of the federation.
You can't worry about the illegal immigration in the region.
Last year, just over 100,000 foreigners registered as migrants.
But only one in five has a formal work permit.
Where the rest of them work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional Duma, said: "They broke the law, but they are not criminals".
There's no court, they have to be deported. They have to be held somewhere.
The federation decided to equip such places with regional funds.
In the Voronezh region, such a place is identified - it is Old Olshanka of the Semilyuk district.
And finally, the regional parliament has granted new benefits to large families.
First, families with five or more children are exempt from transportation tax.
The budget is $3.5 million, but that's the same amount that a large family can save.
Second, and most importantly, those who adopt three or more children will be given housing subsidies from the new year.
The new law provides for 18 square meters for each family member, at a price of 30,000 per meter.
A family, for example, is made up of six people - a father, a mother, a child, and three adopted children.
According to the regulations, the state buys them a 108 square meter house for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
Left Bank or Southwest is a pretty good option.
Well, at the county fair, you can buy a cottage for that.
Baumgertner nominated to the board of directors of Uralkali.
The current board of directors of Uralkali has proposed the candidacy of the arrested general director Vladislav Baumgertner in Minsk to the new board, the Russian company's website reports.
Baumgartner is on the list of 11 people nominated for the new board.
The list was prepared for the extraordinary shareholders' meeting on November 29, at which the new board of directors will be determined by voting.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
He was arrested in August of this year and charged with abuse of office.
However, later the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko at a press conference stated that the charges against Baumgertner were re-qualified as "kidnapping".
Matt Dalton, the goalkeeper of Neftekhimika, refused to comment on the departure of Vladimir Krikunov from the position of coach of the Nizhnekamsk.
The goalkeeper believes that the acting head coach, Dmitry Balmin, enjoys great authority among the players and will handle his duties.
Today, the company sent Krikunov to resign.
To be honest, I would not like to comment on the dismissal of Vladimir Krikunov, - quotes Dalton RIA "News".
I can only say that Dmitry Balmin will handle his responsibilities, I have no doubt about that.
He's a big name in the team, and he's got a big future.
Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci will not help the team in the next match of the Italian championship against Parma.
According to Football Italia, the coaching staff decided not to include him in the game application to save him before the match of the 4th round of the Champions League group round against Real.
Also, Lichtsteiner, Vucinich and Pepe will not take part in the match against Parma.
And the forward Fabio Quagliarella is recovering from his injury and ready to play.
The fuel price will rise as a result of a tax maneuver that will increase the oil's mineral tax (MIT) while reducing export duties and raising excise duties.
According to experts, these measures can bring an additional 619,3 billion rubles to the budget.
The head of the Krasnoyarsk court was hit in the head and his ID was stolen.
Unknown assaulted the chairman of the Krasnoyarsk regional court Vladimir Dvojeconko, stealing his identity card.
According to the Interfax, late Wednesday night, the assailants hit the judge in the head, causing him to lose consciousness.
When the 63-year-old judge regained consciousness, he discovered that his service card had been removed.
The money and other valuables were not taken by the criminals.
Two-Wheelers got to the house on their own, and didn't call the police until the next day.
We're investigating the crime and looking for the culprits.
The fans of Zenit on the official website of the club recognized the ex-captain of the Russian national team as the best player of the past month.

US Secretary of State: Intelligence sometimes "goes too far" in data collection
US Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that the US intelligence community sometimes "went too far" in gathering data and listening, but said the media report of 70 million people being intercepted was not true.
I assure you, innocent people were not harmed in the process, but there was an attempt to gather information.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was illegal.
I recognize this, and the president does too... and we will ensure that this does not happen in the future", the secretary of state was quoted as saying by AFP.
Italian workers are giving way to younger workers
Italian unemployment is breaking records.
The data released on Wednesday showed that 12.5 percent of the country's population is now unemployed.
Things haven't been this bad since World War II.
Among young people, the figure is several times higher.
40.4% of the population aged 15 to 24 are unemployed.
The Italian authorities believe that one solution is to retire older workers early.
The country's largest energy company is already experimenting with this, and the laws passed allow regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement for experienced workers.
However, Italy is facing a common problem in Europe: an ageing population.
And economists are not sure that premature turnover is a viable option.
What will the construction of the TPP in Moscow lead to ?
Every year , the city promises to develop more and more transportation hubs .
By 2020, it is planned to put into operation 255 commercial plants.
Our correspondent was able to find out what the project was really about.
A couple of months ago, a building fence was erected at the Smolensk metro of the Arbatsk-Pokrovsk line.
The sign said the transportation hub was being repaired.
All this was very strange, because near the "Smolenskaya" no ground transport does not stop and, therefore, it is impossible to change on it.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, you have to cover about 130 meters, including the overland crossing through the Karmanitsa Pass.
Now the Smolensk is almost finished.
The flower barn is gone, the newspaper stand is dismantled, and the asphalt in front of the entrance is replaced with pebbles.
That's the whole transportation hub.
The transportation hubs are flat and large, - explained in the press service of the capital's transport department.
There's no capital TPU yet.
Flat-level plans include parking lots, removal of traffic-blocking shopping malls, small architectural structures, and improvements to the city's infrastructure.
In fact, the flat TPUs are not even transported by transportation, but by professional landscapers from the Department of Capital Repair of Moscow.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex structure, explains Mikhail Blinkin, director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy at the Higher School of Economics.
Sometimes a roof over your head and a signboard to tell you when the transport is coming are enough.
For example, a fully-fledged flat-bed transfer station has recently opened at the Yasenovo metro.
No awnings, but with catchy parking lots and a signboard telling you when the bus is coming.
But in the pursuit of numbers, officials write down everything they find in the TPU.
In 2011, the city planned to build 151 nodes, 59 of which were under construction.
Now there are 255 TPUs in the plans until 2020.
One hundred and fifty of them are due this year.
Although the city has a programme for the development of the commercial transport system, no quality criteria have been set, says Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization "City and Transport".
They report on the number of sites, but the quality of transplantation at each of them often deteriorates.
The expert believes there should be two criteria: first, reduction in transplant time, and second, convenience.
First of all, the ability to change modes of transportation without going out in the rain.
In Moscow, when the TPU is being rearranged, it sometimes turns out the opposite.
A vivid example of the VDNH metro.
Previously, the city buses from the Yaroslavl highway came to the park in front of the main entrance to the WTC.
Now their stops have been moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavl to Cosmonauts Street.
It's farther from the subway, farther from the monorail, but closer to the houses.
It's no wonder the residents didn't want the bus station under their windows and complained to all the possible authorities.
The capitalist TPU in Moscow was not immediately successful.
The first one was built five years ago at the Plannerny metro.
The project was meant to be exemplary.
And it really is a sample of how a transfer point that was bought by investors turns into a shopping mall.
No, there's bus platforms, a canopy to keep you from going off the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking.
However, the chemkin trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 were not given a place in the Moscow TPU.
They were pushed away from the subway as strangers.
But there's more room for trade.
There are 32 stores for clothes alone, and there's almost everything from pet stores to car dealerships.
Actually, who on the bus needs to buy a new car on the way?
We always have a shopping mall when we build a major mall.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion when part of the parking lot was put on the market.
Now on the third floor of the PPO "Planerny" among the parking spaces marked on the floor there is a buzzing trade.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian language and the guards staring at our photographer.
The transplant site has finally turned into a bazaar.
The thing is, there used to be a market at the Planner's, but they tore it down.
And in the prefecture, the merchants were spared and allowed to intercept the parking lot of the transfer station.
Still, because of the high prices, it's always empty.
The funny thing is, the market was torn down to build a new, flat-panel TPU.
It's like this.
The distance from the metro entrance to the bus was 50 meters, - says Alexander Morozov.
After the shopping center, supposedly a commercial center, was built, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the entire mall.
After 10pm, when it's closed, you have to go around it in the open.
However, the structures on the "Planer" and "Kaluzhskaya" will soon appear in bloom.
In mid-September, the city land commission approved the planning decisions for the first eight capital TPUs.
Four of them will be 25 stories, not counting the two or three underground levels.
The main monster will grow at the Tusino subway, it will be 418,7 thousand square meters.
Representatives of the Russian Railways Railway Station Directorate, which is responsible for the construction of the underground transit system, have already told journalists that the future multi-storey buildings will house shops, hotels and apartments.
Officials say multi-level parking lots will take up between a third and half of the site.
Take the example of a "popular" garage.
Let's say a 258-car garage that was recently built on International Street is 8,015 square feet.
So, for a parking lot for 2,600 cars at Petrovsko-Razumovskaya, we'll need about 80,000 square feet.
That's less than a third of the machine they're going to build there.
Let's get one or two floors for bus platforms.
There's at least 150,000 square feet of commercial real estate left.
And that, for a minute, is almost two GUMs.
If the major commercial sites at stations and stations are built by railway workers, the rest of the sites will be developed by metro workers.
They also promised that there would be many "functional facilities", including hotels, offices, and even gyms.
By the way, the Moscow City Property Department recently told reporters that they are working on a draft resolution that would allow investors to apply to officials directly for a plot of land for the TPU.
No competition.
Because they say transportation issues are a priority for the city.
The ideal TPU is, for example, the Harvard station in Boston or the Spadayna station in Toronto, says Alexander Morozov.
There, trolleybuses and trams descend underground to the level of the subway, and the distance from the subway car to the tram is only 50 meters without going out.
No unnecessary trade around.
But Moscow officials are being pushed to the extreme.
Either we don't build anything or we just move 25 floors of office and apartments.
Esser suggests that insulting patriotic sentiments be equated with extremism
To legislatively protect citizens' patriotic feelings from provocations and insults directed against Russia, "Justice Russia" proposes to equate insulting patriotic feelings with extremist activity and punish it with five years in prison.
According to the newspaper "Izvestia", such amendments to the legislation, prepared by the deputy chairman of the Duma Committee on Energy Oleg Mikheev, have already been sent to the Supreme Court and the government for an opinion.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of a person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for this country, responsible attitude to its fate, respect for its history and culture.
As Miheev points out, domestic legislation has sanctions for abusing the formal signs of state power - the flag and the coat of arms.
At the same time, according to the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, whose feelings can be hurt by insulting state symbols and other disrespect for our country, is not sufficiently worked out in Russian legislation.
As an example, he cites the annual debate on the eve of Victory Day, when some media personalities allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the USSR people in the fight against the fascists.
On the eve of the main national holiday - the Victory Day on May 9 - a real vacanal takes place every year.
Some publicists, using their wit and "alternative view" of history, have come to the conclusion that it is a pity that the cultured Germans did not conquer the savage Soviet Union.
I consider this absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the nation's main "spiritual cradle", - Oleg Miheev is indignant.
In addition, according to Mikheev, there are more patriotic people in Russia than religious, but the law punishes for insulting the feelings of believers, and insulting patriotic feelings can be practically unpunished.
According to the people's elected representative, it is necessary to equate insulting patriotic feelings with extremist activity and write in the 282nd article of the Criminal Code the appropriate punishment.
The bill provides for a fine of up to $100,000 and up to five years in prison for insulting patriotic sentiments.
A magnitude 6.6 earthquake occurred on Thursday, October 31, in the area of the city of Coquimbo in central Chile, Reuters news agency reports.
The epicenter was located in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and 54 kilometers southwest of the city, the US Geological Survey (USGS) website said.
The tremors were recorded at 20: 03 local time (3: 03 November 1 Moscow).
No casualties or damage from the quake have been reported.
Recall that Chile is located in one of the most seismically active regions on earth, so earthquakes of varying magnitude are not uncommon.
One of the most serious occurred in 2010.
The 8.8-magnitude earthquake and tsunami that followed killed more than 550 people and destroyed 220,000 buildings in Chile.
In addition, Chile was hit by the most powerful earthquake in recent history, a 9.5-magnitude quake in 1960.
More than 5,000 people died in that disaster.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be dealt with fairly
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said Friday that the Greenpeace activists' case would be considered in strict accordance with Russian law.
France can be sure that the case will be handled in accordance with the law, we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee compliance with the law", said Dmitry Medvedev at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
Among the Greenpeace activists arrested is a French citizen.
Pierre Pisanne, like the other activists, is accused of hooliganism.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture towards the detained citizen", Mr. Eero was quoted as saying by RIA Novosti.
"Our country cannot support activities that can harm the environment, no one has the right to break the laws", - said in turn Dmitry Medvedev.
According to him, the activities of any structures that try to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy extraction, are dangerous.
He stressed that these objects are "like a powder keg", and recalled what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, reports RIA Novosti.
UN announces new goals for poverty alleviation
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to end global poverty.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in pushing the Sustainable Development Goals to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015, ahead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit that kicked off in Rio last night.
They were included in the final document to be signed by world leaders, including Mrs. Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told the summit participants the night before that it was time to "stand above national interests".
"I am pleased that UN member states have agreed to launch and take charge of the process of creating the universal Sustainable Development Goals", he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda.
I will make every effort to use the powers vested in me by the Member States to implement our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which is based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique rise as conflict between powerful figures
Under a statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, looking down on them, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to chant peace slogans in one of the rare demonstrations here.
"We want peace back; we want stability", said Vanessa de Sousa, the CEO of an investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed her business suit to a T-shirt emblazoned with the words "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there were almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo - some of the most violent clashes since the truce was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement that was supported first by the white Rhodesian government and then by the apartheid-era South African government as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 ceasefire, it became an opposition party.
Analysts say the country is unlikely to slip into full-scale conflict again, but recent events have made foreign investors and locals nervous.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Brazil's Vale, Italy's Eni and the US's Anadarko.
The ruling Frelimo party, the leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo party blame each other for the tensions.
The Renamo party claims that the government has been behind the latest clashes, attacking its members in the province of Sofala, Renamo's traditional stronghold, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels then escalated when government troops attacked Renamo's bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlacamu  the group's leader, Fernando Mazanga, a Renamo spokesman, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for starting the clashes, accusing the party of attacking the soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to allay fears of instability.
Gebouza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt like a "loser" who wanted to use "everything left in his power to try to prove that he can impose his own decisions on the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist they want to avoid war.
However, fears grew after reports that Mazanga had announced Renamo's withdrawal from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he meant the failure of the Frelimo party to abide by the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with all seriousness", said Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions, which have been exacerbated by a series of clashes this year.
"These are two powerful people (Gebouza and Dhlakama) who have been facing each other", said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
Neither of them is a good negotiator and neither of them is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is trying to push for electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the November municipal elections.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to get concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
Renamo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while the new party  Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve its performance in this election.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Gebouza, who is due to step down next year when his second term ends, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want multiparty democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency", said Mazanga.
It is unclear what capabilities Renamo has, but it has already carried out destructive and rapid attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key highway that runs north-south.
Most of the clashes took place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometers north of Maputo but includes Beirut  a port that mining companies including Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended railway use for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was evasive when asked if Renamo would repeat the threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique", said Mazanga.
The instability has increased government discontent, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent increase in kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and that they should find solutions to these problems", he says.
Omar Sultan, a demonstrator, said people just want stability.
"Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace, they want free access to roads", he said.
The first series of "Art-Mainstream" films will be held in Moscow
The series of "Art-Mainstream" film screenings, where the audience will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release, will be held in the "Rolan" cinema from November 1 to 5, RIA Novosti reports with reference to the organizers of the project.
The Art Mainstream's program opens with a French comedy by director and actress Reim Kerrichi, Paris at any price.
It is the story of French model Maya (Kerichi herself), who is deported to her homeland of Morocco due to visa problems.
In addition to Kerrichi's film, the audience will also see the new film of famous South Korean director Kim Ki Duk, "Mebius", Oliver Hirshbigel's melodramatic biography "Diana: a love story" (Diana) starring Naomi Watts and the main film of the Cannes Film Festival "Adel's Life" by Abdelatif Keshish, which took place in May.
The only Russian participant of the "Art-Mainstream" will be the winner of the "Kinotavr" festival Alexander Veledinsky's film "Geographer the globe drank" based on the novel of the same name by Alexei Ivanov.
The main role - the charming loser-teacher Victor Sluzhkin - was played by Konstantin Habensky, whose work was also awarded the "Kinotavr" prize.
Children should learn about myths and legends as 'models of lifestyle', says the author.
The Torah may show that brute force cannot defeat subtle cunning, but the legends of King Arthur show the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too indecent to be taught in schools", Crossley-Holland advocates "a careful selection of age-appropriate texts".
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education", he said.
I've been advocating for them in the curriculum for 20 years.
He added that the "excessive moralizing" of authors and teachers "distracted" children, and the main ideas "sublimated" into fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Norwegian Myth Collection for Penguin and British Folk Tales, said, "You may have intentions, but you'd better keep them to yourself".
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some kind of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or have a happy ending, but it does have to be an innate sense of right and wrong.
And it needs to be sublimated; it needs to be revealed through history, not articulated.
The old rule: show, not tell.
A football fan was arrested in Voronezh region after breaking a window in the station's waiting room.
At nine o'clock on the evening of October 29 at the station of Glutzy-Voronegsk transport police officers took two football fans from the passenger train - born in the Moscow region.
On their way to a game, the boys had a drunken spree on the train.
The young men were taken to the line police station in Glutzy to make a report of an administrative offence.
There, the fans were remorseful for their anti-social behavior.
The police filed a report and let them go.
The young people bought tickets for the next train and waited at the station for it to arrive.
At midnight, the fans left the train station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old, suddenly returned and broke the window of the front door in the waiting room of the station.
A traffic police officer and a guard at the "RZD" police station rushed to the sound of the broken glass.
They managed to apprehend the perpetrator who was trying to flee the scene.
The personnel of the South-East LU of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs are conducting a check.
The issue of criminal proceedings is being considered, said Sergey Olkhovik, senior referent of the information and public relations department of the South-Eastern Transport Unit of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs.
What about the watermelons?
I feel like we're 15 years behind.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion about the unrest on the stands during the match of the Cup of Russia "Shinnik" - "Spartacus".
I'm all for the organizers of sports events being responsible for all this: clubs, leagues, RFU.
But we see that they're taking a different position.
They're waiting for someone from outside to come and clean up.
It's a very good position, but not quite the right one.
We need to organize the fans, the clubs need to invite their stewards, not let things go unchecked.
We've just drafted a special government regulation on stadium conduct.
Once it's passed, we'll get to the bottom of it.
But I'll definitely invite all the organizers of the football trial.
I read the interview with Leonid Fedun.
The state, they say, let's get the law done.
It feels like Bayern fans came to Yaroslavl and arranged it.
We're the outside observers.
It's actually terrible to see the bleachers being sprayed with flames.
And this is in a country that's preparing for the World Cup.
"I feel like we're back 10-15 years", Mutko said.
Snowden may be questioned in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence official Edward Snowden is unlikely to travel outside Russia to testify in the German Chancellor Angela Merkel wiretapping case.
A source familiar with the situation told Interfax on Friday that the American could answer questions from the German prosecutor general's office in writing or face-to-face in Russia.
Edward Snowden's travel outside Russia is virtually impossible.
"In this case, he will lose his refugee status and could be extradited to Washington by US allies", the source said.
"At the same time, in principle, the German Prosecutor General's Office could send its representatives to Russia or hand over written questions to Snowden", the source added, adding that the issue should be worked out at the interstate level.
Earlier, German Bundestag MP Hans-Christian Schrebele said Edward Snowden was ready to testify in the case of the American intelligence services' eavesdropping on the German chancellor's talks.
Snowden is prepared to testify to German law enforcement either in Moscow or on German soil.
The ex-CIA agent made it clear he knew a lot.
Despite the fact that the NSA has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, for this, it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions for his arrival", - said Strebele to Euronews.
Snowden's lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on the Interfax source's statement, said his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how he would do so was up to him.
US citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013 and then leaked information about secret US intelligence surveillance operations online.
Snowden was flying through Moscow in transit, but was unable to leave the airport because his passport was canceled by the US authorities, who had made serious accusations against him in absentia, and remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport until early August.
On August 1, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a year and left Sheremetyevo the same day.
Yesterday, the American lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said that his client had taken a job at a "large Russian company".
The NSA surveillance of Angela Merkel was reported by the German media last week.
According to journalists, the Americans began listening to the chancellor's phone calls in 2002.
The surveillance station was supposedly located at the US embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, after the publication of this information, said that the surveillance of Merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
Ponomarev has left "Fair Russia"
The Deputy of the State Duma from the party "Justice Russia", member of its branch in Novosibirsk Ilya Ponomarev submitted an application to leave the political organization.
As the parliamentarian stated, he submitted the application to the Novosibirsk regional branch of the party.
According to its charter, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of the "just Russians".
We're sitting here drinking tea...
"For some reason, many people want to see the picture "Ilia Ponomarev puts a party ticket on the table", but there is nothing so epochal in it", - the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintains good relations with the regional branch of the "Esers".
Meanwhile, Ilia Ponomarev does not intend to give up his mandate as a state Duma deputy.
He explained that despite leaving the party, he remains a member of the faction and cannot leave it by law.
The news of Ilya Ponomarev's intention to leave the "Just Russia" party appeared on October 30.
It was reported that along with him from "SR" will leave Dmitry Gudkov and Valery Zubov, but the latter soon denied this information.
Japan will discuss a peace treaty with Russia
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to openly exchange views on further development of political dialogue, discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty", Kisida said at the meeting.
The Japanese Foreign Minister recalled that after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between the two countries became warmer and took on a bilateral character.
The Russian minister, in turn, noted that Russia will go along with Japan in solving complex political issues, RIA Novosti reports.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the issue of the disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, protests are taking place in Tokyo today to demand the return of the land lost to the country after World War II.
Cars are driving through the Japanese capital, with the words "Return the Northern Territories!"
The police don't stop the protesters, they make sure the noise level is not exceeded.
Ben Greenman: The tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: The New Yorker
It's safe to say that New York is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a century ago, Frank Faye, a stage actor who worked as a confidential performer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the audience in a conversational fashion.
Faye's innovation has been picked up by others, most recently the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and curated by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the stand-up club Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these headliners started in the Carolinas and then got more successful, got to the point where they were too famous to perform in a club", Hirsch said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the annual Stand Up for Heroes musical comedy benefit concert for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has expanded.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival have gained popularity in an unconventional way, such as through shows on smaller TV channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll rose to fame for his role in a sketch comedy series on a little-known cable television network (namely, FXX's scarecrow-themed fantasy football league), and now hosts his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was cast in both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, though she is best known for the viral series Marcel - a shell in shoes.
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians with a distinctive style (surrealist pessimistic Anthony Jesselnik, cunning, racially focused Kamau Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be an interview with David Steinberg and Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a stand-up comedian, but later became a successful director in television and film, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held at Town Hall in midtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely the centerpiece of all of Larry's work", Steinberg said.
He told me that when he came here, he sometimes walked down some alley between two houses and thought, "If I run out of money, maybe I'll live here".
Pakistani authorities begin talks with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the embassy of this country in the UK, where the Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif is on a visit.
The Pakistani prime minister made the announcement about talks with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed Pakistan-India relations, the global energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The Prime Minister has announced that dialogue with the Taliban has begun", the Pakistan Embassy in London said in a statement.
- He said he hoped and prayed that the dialogue would work in accordance with the constitution of Pakistan", the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the Afghan movement of the same name, but operate independently in the northwestern regions of the country, bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are seeking to establish an Islamic state.
The government of Islamabad has previously attempted to start talks with the local Taliban, but the movement has refused to engage in dialogue.
It said it would only enter into negotiations if the authorities withdrew troops stationed in areas where the Taliban were active and released the jailed Islamists.
Nawaz Sharif has arrived in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, October 29, British Prime Minister David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a trilateral meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil has fallen to $96 a barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about large reserves overshadowed a message that China's energy-intensive manufacturing sector was gaining momentum.
The benchmark US oil in December's supply fell 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 a barrel late morning European time in electronic trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract fell 39 cents, bringing the total price drop to 5.8 percent in October.
Rich oil reserves have affected its value in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. reserves have increased by 4.1 million barrels in the past week.
In five weeks, the reserves have been replenished by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was a hint of a possible rise in demand, according to two reports of Chinese industry showing a surge in activity.
This indicates that China's economic recovery may continue to pick up momentum after the third-quarter growth rate rose to 7.8 percent from a 20-year low in the previous quarter.
Brent oil, the benchmark international oil used by U.S. refiners, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel at the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
"Colorado" head coach Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release goalkeeper Semen Varlamov from the first minutes in Friday's match with Dallas, expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars did not shake his confidence in the Russian, reports from Dallas "SE" coach Natalia Shmelev.
"What are we waiting for?" said Rowe after the morning "Avalanche" roller coaster ride.
Of course, we're all concerned about what happened, but we're confident in him and feel that it will be good for him to get on the ice today.
We want him to get on the ice and show his usual level.
So you're absolutely sure that the situation didn't affect the goalkeeper's condition?
We'll see about that tonight.
No doubt our players will support Varley by helping him defend the goal, as they have in previous games this season.
The point is, no one on the team is going to jump to any conclusions until this situation is resolved in court.
In Siberia , you can 't be a vegan: greenhouse tomatoes can 't replace soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, a correspondent of RIA Novosti found out.
People who completely abandon animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here they cannot survive the winter without losing their health, and no greenhouse tomatoes compensate for them, according to the survey of Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors on the eve of the Vegan Day.
Drinking oil by the liters
Strict vegetarianism, which refuses not only meat and fish but also milk, honey, and eggs, is becoming a fashionable way of life.
However, nutritionists say that in Novosibirsk and other cities in Siberia, such strict dietary standards are at least not good for health.
The complete rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids that are very difficult to compensate for by plant proteins.
"It is important to include at least milk or eggs in your diet", says nutritionist Marina Bogaj.
She cites fish as an example, which contains the essential fatty acid omega-3.
The most abundant vegetable oil is flaxseed oil.
"To get the amount you need, you have to drink a ton of water!" says a nutritionist.
Doctors believe that in winter, the diet of Siberians should be taken with a grain of salt.
This season is particularly challenging for vegetarians.
In our current environment, food demands are high.
You need a high calorie diet to keep you warm.
"If you limit yourself to animal products, you are not getting enough of these calories", says one expert.
This is what nutritionist Olga Pozniak agrees with.
She adds that importing fruit and vegetables is not an option.
It is best to eat foods that are grown in the region where you live or where you were born.
The genetic code is designed to better digest and process these foods.
In winter, people don't want to eat a cucumber, but a hot soup or something more filling", explains the doctor.
She says that among the foods that vegans can eat, the most beneficial are grains, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples left over for the winter, frozen berries.
But that's definitely not enough to get a good nutrition.
According to gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, Siberians have sufficient vitamin levels only from mid-August to mid-September.
It is not practical to go vegetarian altogether in our harsh natural environment, where temperatures can change by 30 degrees Celsius a day and snow falls in May.
The body needs energy to live, and fat is the most important", says the doctor.
Doctors say that veganism is especially harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow, they need building materials, including amino acids.
And if we go vegetarian, we give them less.
Pregnant women also need a higher protein, vitamin, and nutrient intake.
"Vegans are short of them", I'm sure of God.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose whatever he wants, "to play with whatever toys he wants".
He has a well-formed organism, skeleton, organs.
And yet, children need to be fed.
If parents deprive their children of certain micronutrients or amino acids by choosing what they eat for them, it is simply a violation of their rights.
"A lack of nutrients for brain development, vision, and bone growth is not something you can replace tomorrow", she says.
All the medical specialists interviewed agree that the quality of vegetables and fruits grown in greenhouses and imported in winter is poor.
What we bring in and grow in greenhouses contains fewer micronutrients than what we need in the open.
"The quality of the food is not the same", says Bogayi.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire to harvest more harvests at the expense of quality.
"Apples don't turn brown on cutting, cucumbers quickly turn yellow and moldy, and tomatoes taste and smell bad", he says, adding that they are likely over-fertilized.
And they become suppliers of fiber, not vitamins.
This is not the opinion of the head of the laboratory of the Siberian Physics-Technical Institute of Agrarian Problems, the candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk.
She says that with the right approach and all the rules and regulations in greenhouses, it is possible to grow whole vegetables.
If you try to get more out of the ground per square meter, you'll of course have to water more often and overfeed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when nitrogen fertilizers are too high, tomatoes grow quickly, they are large, but watery and not sweet", she explains, adding that the quality is primarily a matter of conscience for the producer.
The court suspended the " stop-and-search " practice at the New York Police Department .
On Thursday, a federal appeals court stayed a court order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-search program and removed the judge from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has said that the execution of Judge Shira Sheindlin's decision will be suspended pending the outcome of the city's appeal.
In August, a judge ruled that the city violated the constitution in its program of street arrest and interrogation.
The city appealed its decision and the corrective measures order, including an injunction to appoint an inspector to help the police department change its work practices and related training program.
On Thursday, the appeals court heard arguments from the parties in the motion to dismiss.
The Court of Appeals held that the judge had violated the U.S. Code of Judicial Conduct and failed to consider the need to avoid showing bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the court's criticism.
A judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unreasonably targeting blacks and Hispanics with a stop-and-search program.
It has appointed an external controller to oversee the sweeping changes, which include reforms in policy, training and control, and has decided to launch a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in the police stations where most arrests take place.
In August, New York City decided to end the practice of keeping names and addresses of people whose cases were closed after police checks.
The city's appeal hearing is scheduled for March 14, 2014.
The "stop and search" tactic has been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
The stop-and-search has been around for decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latino.
In 2004, four people, all  representatives of national minorities, filed a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the New York Police Department's Stop-and-Search program say these changes will end the practice, create a more reliable and efficient police service, and may influence how other police departments implement the practice.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale rather than crime rates, lead to unnecessary money spending, and fail to address the more global problem of police harsh conditions due to a decline in the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the "stop-and-search" practice, which is constitutional, but she did change the way the NYPD stops people.
Pedestrian zone opened in Tretyakov Gallery
A new pedestrian zone has been opened in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretyakov Gallery and occupies a two-kilometer section from the metro station "Novokuzнецкая" to the Wetland Square.
Street corners, flower beds, benches, urns and toilets have been installed throughout, and the fence and illegal advertising have been removed.
In addition to the Clients and Lavrushyn alleys, which were already pedestrian, five streets were closed for cars - the Ordinsky dead end, the Big and Small Tolmachev alleys, the Kadašovsky embankment and the Marsh Square.
The traffic on the streets of Marošej and Petrovka is not restricted.
On Friday Street, from the entrance to the "Novokuzнецka" station to the Clients' alley, pedestrians are allowed to walk without restricting traffic, newsmsk.com reports.
Inside the pedestrian zone are the Tretyakov Gallery, the temple of the holy martyr Clement of Rome, museums, libraries, monuments and other attractions.
Previously, the Tver Pass, Stolechnikov alley and Kuznetsky Bridge Street were completely pedestrianised.
The large Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, is closed to cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson used a phone hacking to verify a classified message.
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "hacking, surveillance and confrontations" to try to confirm false information about the novel by Charles Clarke, then interior minister.
Prosecutor, Crown Counsel Andrew Eades told the Old Bailey that in May 2005 the News of the World had received false news that Clark was dating his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Polby.
The paper had a private investigator named Glenn Mulcair hack into Polby's voice mail and stalk her outside her home for an interview, but Coulson also called her and left voice messages, the court heard.
"The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who would stand outside someone's house hoping to catch someone off guard, he is the kind of person who likes to offer a story to people to see what they have to say", Mr. Addis said.
He said the News of the World used three methods to investigate the stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontational.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
He obviously knows about the second one, the surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yeah!"
The rumors of Clarke's affair first came to the attention of the News of the World when a source sexually interested in Mrs. Polby was told, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles".
A voice-mail tape, obtained from her phone at least three times, was seized from Mulcair's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found a private investigator's computer records that listed Miss Polby and her sister as "Projects".
During the period of her surveillance, Mrs. Polby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Addis said.
At the time, former chief reporter Neville Turleback and former reporter James Weatherrap were overseeing surveillance of Mrs. Polby's movements.
In a voice message to her on 18 June 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story we plan to publish tomorrow and I would very much like to discuss it with Charles".
Mr. Addis said Coulson's involvement in this story was based on the same scenario as other influential people, like former Home Secretary David Blankett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr. Blanket about an affair with a married woman while he was dating his match, Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny colluding with other people to hack into phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcair, Turlback and Weatherup all admitted to hacking phones.
Snowden says he 's willing to talk to the German authorities about the wiretap .
Former CIA agent Edward Snowden says he is ready to travel to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to meet with German officials, RIA Novosti reports.
The letter from a former CIA employee to the German authorities was presented to reporters in Berlin on Friday by Bundestag MP Hans-Christian Schrebele, through whom Snowden passed the message on to the German authorities.
Shtrebele met with Snowden in Moscow the day before.
Four people were injured in a fire on Tver Street
As a result of the fire in the collector in the center of Moscow, on Tver Street, four passersby were injured.
According to the Interfax news agency, one of the injured has been hospitalized.
According to the source, passersby were injured in the smoke in the underground passage.
According to the head of the capital's fuel and energy department, Pavel Livinsky, electricity supply has been fully restored to all houses on Tver Street.
The fire in the heat collector near the house 15 on Tver Street occurred on the evening of October 31.
Heavy smoke billowed from the storm drain, and a smoke billowing from the underground passageway near the Armenia store.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses on Tver Street were left without electricity.
At 21:45 Moscow time, the fire was extinguished.
The U.S. is cutting food assistance for the poor.
Food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $ 36 a month
The U.S. government is cutting back on food stamps as the program expires on Friday.
Food assistance for a family of four will now be $36 less per month than before, officials say.
It will affect the poorest 47 million Americans.
According to Reuters, in fiscal 2012, the average per capita income was $133 a month.
Food aid spending in the United States has risen to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14 percent of Americans rely on free food stamps, which have been around since the days of paper food stamps.
When the current economic crisis hit, the program was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
But Republicans in Congress are demanding further cuts to the program, saying it should be aimed at helping those who need it most.
Grocery store owners across America are worried that the cuts will lead to lower consumer spending.
U.S. Congressmen continue to debate how to further reduce government funding.
Blizzard released a free 19-year-old platformer
Blizzard released their 1994 PC platformer Blackthorne for free.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to him, the game is available on Battle.net in the Blizzard Classic games section.
However, some gamers note that currently only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service can download it.
The game is also not available to Russian users.
According to media reports, the version Blizzard has now released for PC is no different from the original version of the game.
The Blackthorne soundtrack also remained unchanged.
Blackthorne, a platform game released by Blizzard 19 years ago, was originally released on the SNES.
It was set on the planet Thule, whose inhabitants were divided into the dark and the light kingdoms.
One day, the dark lord Sarlak decided to kill the bright King Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The game's main character is Vlaros' son Kyle, who was saved from death by being sent to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returns to Tuul to fight Sarlacs and protect the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game released by the studio after its renaming to Blizzard Entertainment.
It was called Silicon & Synapse before that.
Blackthorne was published by Interplay.
New vending machines will be installed in the Moscow metro.
But they won't be selling tickets to passengers for money, they'll be selling tickets for seating.
A trip of 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger 30 seats.
The number of seats will be calculated by a special device using modern technologies, reports ITAR-TASS with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first machine will be installed at the station "Exhibition" on November 8, 2013.
The presentation of the new ticket sportsmen will be hosted by the President of the Russian Olympic Committee Alexander Zhukov and Olympic champions gymnasts Alexey Nemov and Elena Zamolotchikova.
The NSA 's admissions are fueling corporate paranoia about government surveillance .
On a warm day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On the instructions of the Federal Constitution Protection Service (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence service, his assignment was to photograph the roof of the US Embassy building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to detect the antennas of the listening devices, and this action led to talks between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, reassured in September that the United States does not use foreign intelligence capabilities to steal foreign companies' trade secrets for American companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.
But ever since Edward Snowden -- a contract worker turned whistleblower -- began to publish his treasure trove of US intelligence secrets, European governments and corporate executives are no longer sure whether the director can be trusted on his word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency was monitoring the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gaining access to data stored by US cloud service providers including Google and Yahoo have raised corporate paranoia about state surveillance to new heights.
The latest was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been tapped for perhaps a decade.
If Europe's most powerful person can be a target, then of course business leaders are potential targets.
Snowden made it clear that there was intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies.
I think it's quite likely that this data is being used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up", says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, the association representing Germany's small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies believe the US now poses almost as much risk as China in industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by consultancy EY.
In all the documents released by Mr. Snowden, however, there is still no evidence that the United States has passed on trade secrets from foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked certain capabilities in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the opinion that it should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"It's not an option", says Gass Plattner, president of German business software company SAP.
If there is a need for a strong European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized: from coal to cars and farmers.
All but the IT industry.
Yet the scope and sophistication of the U.S. spy agencies that Snowden's revelations have brought to light has come as a shock to some companies that previously thought China was the biggest surveillance risk.
The big shift is in cloud technology, where CEOs of European companies have become more aware that data stored in the US is in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade association, about 10 percent of its non-U.S. members abandoned plans to use the services of a U.S.-based cloud provider after the disclosure of the U.S. intelligence-gathering program Prism.
Jim Snape, one of the executive directors of SAP, said, "We're seeing consumers asking a new question that didn't come up a year ago, which is: Where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will physically stay in that jurisdiction?"
Many German executives say the latest reports are just a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore that data must be protected at all costs.
The fact that there's economic espionage going on is not surprising.
It's always been there.
"It has been a topic of discussion for many years and has not changed much in the current controversy", says Kurt Bock, chief executive of BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, and we are spying on them because it is in our national interest to protect our commercial enterprises.
Corporate leaders usually don't like to brag about the retaliatory measures they've taken, because it might give the opponent an advantage.
The idea has long been accepted by large companies that taking a free flash drive to a trade show or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is at least reckless.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member at the carmaker Audi, says it has been standard practice for years to remove cell phones before board meetings so they can't be used as listening devices.
The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution recommends that company executives consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid cell phones are later discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are leaders in their respective niche in the world market.
Small and medium-sized companies often lack the expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorised access, warns the BfV report.
The United States warns its own companies about economic espionage by other countries.
A U.S. national intelligence report in February placed France, along with Russia and Israel, second only to China in the number of hackers who engage in economic intelligence, The Washington Post claims.
A board member of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, the French are the worst.
Bernard Scarsini, former head of France's domestic intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: "The services are well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies".
The parents of a teenager in Georgia who died in a "ridiculous accident" believe their son was murdered.
The parents of a Georgia teenager whose body was found inside a rolled-up sports mat in his high school gymnasium believe their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia was found on January 11 in a vertical mat, leaning against the bleachers in the gymnasium of his high school.
Lawndes County Sheriff's Department investigators have concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family disputes that.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered", said Benjamin Crump, an attorney representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said.
"They believe it's against logic, laws of physics, and common sense", Kramp said.
They think it's a cover to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned to them in a body bag", he said.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made the announcement at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll look at all the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe there are sufficient grounds" for an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy showed Johnson died of "positional asphyxiation".
However, the second autopsy, Moore said, revealed a different cause of death.
"There are a few issues that need to be resolved or clarified", he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to demand a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
A spokesman for the Lowndes County Sheriff's Department was not available for comment when he was contacted Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance video footage that investigators have seen.
The teen's parents said they hope the video footage holds the key to how he died.
"Spartak": For information about the people who hung the fascist symbols
On the official website of "Spartacus" there is a statement from the Moscow club regarding the appearance of the fascist flag on the podium in Yaroslavl.
"At the cup match "Shinnik" - "Spartacus" on October 30th, unknown provocateurs at the stadium in Yaroslavl demonstrated fascist symbolism.
We ask anyone with any credible information about the perpetrators of this crime to provide it.
"The reward is guaranteed", the statement said.
We're looking for the fans who hung the fascist flag in Yaroslavl.
Recall that in the match of 1/16 of the final of the Cup of Russia "Shinnik" - "Spartacus" was interrupted several times due to disturbances on the stands.
Also in the fans' sector of "Spartacus" was demonstrated fascist symbolism.
As a penalty, Spartacus can play about three games without spectators.
There's a committee meeting on Friday.
If you have any information about whoever moved and hung this symbol, please contact us.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued recommendations for schools about allergies in children.
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a list of recommendations for controlling food allergies in school children.
This is the first list of recommendations issued by the U.S. government at a time when the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is on the rise.
Now, one in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and staff about food allergies in children and how to help if an allergic reaction occurs.
It also recommends that schools keep a supply of adrenaline  most commonly used for injections is the EpiPen automatic medical syringe  to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures recently amended regulations to allow schools to stockpile adrenaline with less difficulty.
The notification also lists the typical symptoms described by children who have had an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "I feel like something is sticking to my tongue", "I feel like I have hair on my tongue", or "My tongue is a pinch".
Parents of intersex children can choose an unknown gender
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third sex in children born with intermediate type external genitalia.
Newborns will no longer be required to be assigned male or female.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender of such children, allowing parents to indicate the gender as "undefined" or "undetermined" on their birth certificates.
The law was intended to relieve pressure on parents who may make hasty decisions about sex reassignment surgery for newborns and to counter discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said years later: "I am neither male nor female".
I'm just gonna be a doctor-made, scraped-up product with bruises and scars.
Approximately one in every 2,000 babies born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of sexual development disorder, a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or seminal) or abnormally developed external genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification is still poorly understood, but most experts in the United States say that if gender cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign it than to wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before having surgery, if it ever happens.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said the new German law "sounds like a good idea".
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening disorders that require surgery, but most children don't", he said.
You can assign a gender without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops any gender identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the questions about why this is happening.
It's like a mystery about why people are homosexual.
A report sent to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people because their condition is not related to gender but to their biological makeup, which is not exclusively male or female, but is typical of both at the same time or neither.
These characteristics may be expressed in secondary sex characteristics such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breast and body composition; primary sex characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, violence and prejudice-based crime.
Boys with gender dysphoria now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to put male, female or third gender on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Welby became the first person in the world to be recognized as "sexual oriented" after defending in court the right to retain his "undefined" sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the German passports will use a third designation in addition to M and F  X, that is, intersex.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers in France, a country with a strong Catholic tradition, signed a petition to remove "gender theory" from school textbooks.
The US website Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with the German law, writing that "in a situation where the world is being pulled into a new state where sex is a matter of choice and sexual activity is not, we are overturning two more pillars of civilization".
A newborn mother in Maryland also told the Baby Zone website that she would prefer to have the sex of the baby determined at birth.
"Raising a child is hard enough and without any additional restrictions, especially if you don't know the gender of your child", she told the parent website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites, after the beautiful Greek god who had both sexes.
And just a decade ago, the medical community saw gender as a page to be erased and then redrawn.
But now many people are questioning the ethical rationale for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complicated, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how a child will perceive their assigned gender when they grow up.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called a 'psychiatric emergency,'" Dresser said.
When these babies were born, you didn't call the shrink, you called the surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate genitalia was proposed by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender is easily modifiable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that environmental signals, including social ones, such as how parents raise their children, interact with the child's genes and hormones to determine whether a person will consider themselves male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as John/Joan, his theories were called into question.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged during careless circumcision to castrate the child completely, removing his testicles as well, and raise him as a girl.
"Mani presented the case as a successful example of transition, but it wasn't", Dresser said.
When the boy was about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
Dresser said that some doctors are still using this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who had sex-change operations reported being "displeased with the results".
This was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male XY chromosomes but with intermediate genitalia.
Doctors could not tell whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that he would never be able to live a "full" man's life.
So soon after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external genitalia and testicles were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He started taking female hormones at age 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl", he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At 18, he had a vaginoplasty.
But he was depressed and realized something was wrong, so he demanded medical records.
What he found out was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual developmental disorder that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal genital development.
After learning the truth, he became a man again by getting testosterone shots and having his breasts removed.
The surgery rendered him infertile.
Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, which is trying to normalize perceptions of intersex people.
But Ann Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based legal association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law "encourages labeling and stigma".
"Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child an 'uncertain gender,'" she said.
We're afraid he's going to facilitate the intervention.
We think it's better to assume a male or female gender and then wait.
But we haven't seen this law manifest yet, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organisation supports the Australian law as it allows adults to make choices in favour of the third gender.
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal gender identity", she says.
German law provides for it at birth.
It's a battle that little kids shouldn't be fighting at this stage.
When they grow up, they'll be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Barac, a Pittsburgh-based mammologist and radiologist who has a daughter with a developmental disability and who helps hundreds of others in support groups, said that the German law "supports" both parents and children.
Barac's daughter, Kathy, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called androgen total insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are not working properly, Katie has developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Now 29, Kathy is married and completing her residency in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"The law gives parents time to not make hasty decisions themselves", said Barac.
It gives them time to do some analysis and figure things out, and also a window of time before they type "male" or "female".
Then you're fine. Raise a child, love a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't need to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
"It allows children to participate in decision-making and eliminates the anxiety that drives parents because they don't feel they're doing the right thing", she said.
Eventually, the child will decide which floor he or she is most comfortable with, and that's great.
This gives children the opportunity to make their own decisions.
Chicago goalkeeper Nikolai Habibulin stressed that he understands that he has to play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two games of the Hawks, Habibulin first missed six shots from Tampa Bay, then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed shots.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I failed to do that", Habibulin was quoted as saying by CSNChicago.
I need to find confidence in training, maybe I should approach it like a game, and try to get the best result.
You have to look at your past games and work on any flaws that you've had.
There are a few small components I need to improve, but I feel pretty decent in practice.
But somehow, after a few heads, it all turns into some kind of snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
Goalies -- I don't think I'm the only one -- always try to play a perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not happy.
It doesn't matter what happens outside my gate.
I'm still working on myself not to miss that many pucks.
It's great to have my teammates supporting me, but basically, I have to play better.
Two games isn't a whole season, but I wanted to do a lot better.
But it happened.
I have to put this aside.
I'm just gonna try to play my next game better.
A bus has overturned in Altai.
A PAZ bus overturned in the Rubtsov district of Altai Krai.
As a result of the accident, 13 people were injured, according to the regional emergency management.
Earlier, the regional law enforcement agency reported 10 victims.
According to the department, the accident occurred at about 9 a.m. local time on the Novonikolaevka - Vishnevka highway, 1 kilometer from Novonikolaevka.
The bus, which was travelling from Rubtsovsk to Vishnevka, had 12 passengers and the driver, all of whom suffered injuries of varying severity and were hospitalized.
Eleven injured were taken to the No. 1 Rubtsovsk City Hospital, two people were hospitalized in the Central Criminal Hospital of Rubtsovsk.
Medvedev expects the SSJ-100 to be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that after consolidation in the markets of Latin America and Asia, the Superjet 100 aircraft will be supplied to Europe.
"We expect to get agreements for more than 170 aircraft of this type in total", Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
The Russian government head noted that serious cooperation was established with French colleagues, as this is a joint project.
We discussed some financial matters today that are related to insurance, but we hope that once this aircraft is established in the markets of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that it will be delivered to France", the Russian Prime Minister stressed.
SSJ-100 - built by the company "Civil Aircraft of the Sukhot" in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is designed on the basis of modern technology and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment for 100 passenger seats.
The energy department of Dnipropetrovsk region has launched a unique program to save... the stork nests.
In ancient times, to attract storks to their yard, peasants would mount a wheel on a high pole, and the heavy nest would hold up well.
Since such supports have long been abandoned, the stork has become a favorite of the poles of power lines - the interwoven branches support the wires, making the stork's house stand firm.
Grandma Anya, whose house in Ivanovka village of Petrikovsky district has been inhabited by a family of aist for twenty years, began to notice how the nest settled, despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
The birds are laying new branches on top, and the bottom layer has already spread between the wires, about to collapse.
Of course, it is a pity for the family of storks that every year nested outside the yard, brought out and fed three or four chicks in the summer, but you do not want to be without light.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm regions, Anya's grandmother called the Tsarichan REC, which owns the support.
I didn't expect them to react so quickly.
When our specialists came to Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still standing, - said the technical director of DTEC "Dneprooblenergo" Sergey Berezovsky.
The wires, which were already inside the 150- to 200-kilogram nest, began to corrode.
At any moment, the birds could have been killed by electricity.
And the local residents were at risk of losing power because of the damaged wires.
So the line fighters have begun a rescue operation, and not for the first time in our practice.
Scientists from the Dnepropetrovsk National University helped to develop a nest transfer scheme.
They've been running training for the district network.
The famous Dnipropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised the energetics at all stages of the reconstruction of the nests.
First, they estimated that there were more than 50 "apartments" in the area in an emergency condition.
Special metal platforms were welded to resemble a funnel.
The foundation was covered with oak branches, and then the old nest was moved there.
Experts say that laying out old branches as a foundation is enough to help birds recognize their nest and return to it.
After that, the stork will build its own home.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka in the Novomoskovsky district.
Next to the electrical support, a new reinforced concrete pillar was placed and a platform with an old, already inhabited nest was placed on it.
The whole operation cost the energy company 9,000 hryvnia.
And the other day, a similar new home was built in Ivanovka village of Petrikovsky district in the yard of grandmother Ani.
Here, the platform is fixed in place, just lifted over the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice that their "apartment" has been renovated in the spring.
Until the end of the year, the same reconstruction is expected in four more nests in the Pokrovsky and Tsarichansk districts of Dnepropetrovsk region.
By the way, while some people save rare birds, others kill them mercilessly.
Recently, the whole region was shocked by the sad news that in the village of Ust-Kamenka in the Apostolic district, on the day of the opening of the hunt for pheasants, poachers shot a family of swans who lived on a local pond.
The noble birds were not afraid of humans at all - the locals fed them and did not harm them.
When the villagers heard the gunshots and ran to the pond, four handsome swans were already lying dead in the water.
Now the police officers of the Apostol district police department are trying to find out who shot the birds listed in the Red Book.
The Russian March is gaining popularity.
On November 4, the Day of National Unity, the "Russian March" will be held in Moscow, in agreement with the mayor's office.
According to a survey by the Levada Center, support for the Russian marches is growing - 40% of citizens already approve of the idea of holding them.
According to the Levada-center, 40% of citizens in varying degrees approve of the Russian marches: 11% of them are definitely positive and 29% are "rather positive".
The popularity of the idea of "Russian marches" is gradually growing - in 2006 these actions were welcomed by only 14% of Russians, and in December 2010 the holding of such events was supported by twice as many citizens (28%).
Only 7% of Russians say "definitely negative" about the "Russian marches", while 19% say "more negative".
Another 35% could not articulate their attitude to the campaign.
This year, the Moscow City Hall has agreed to hold a Russian march in Lublin with up to 15,000 people, the head of the security department of the capital Alexey Majorov said.
This nationalist action has been held every year on the Day of National Unity since 2005.
To the question of sociologists "Did you hear about the "Russian marches" held on November 4 under the slogan of protecting the rights of Russians in Russia?" three quarters (75%) of the citizens answered negatively.
Now only one in five Russians (20%) know about this campaign .
It is noteworthy that in December 2010 almost a third of citizens (31%) heard about the "Russian marches".
Recall that three years ago, on December 11, a spontaneous rally of nationalists took place in Manezhnaya Square, which turned into a mass riot.
The "Levada-center" also asked Russians about which holiday is celebrated on November 4.
In two years, the number of people who know the right answer (People's Unity Day) increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15% of the population is going to celebrate this holiday.
About the same number (17%) intend to celebrate the October Revolution Day on November 7.
Most citizens (62%) do not plan to celebrate any of these holidays.
How Moscow City Hall agreed to the "Russian March" in Lublin
On October 28, the capital authorities agreed to hold a "Russian march" on November 4 in Lublin.
This was reported by the leader of the association "Russians", the organizer of the march Dmitry Demushkin.
In addition to the march in Lublin on the Day of National Unity, a rally and a rock concert by the band "Kolovrat" will be held, also agreed with the authorities.
How the Russian March 2012 went
On the Day of National Unity in 2012, nationalists marched from the Yakima Embankment to the Central House of the Artist, where a rally took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants at 20,000, the Ministry of Internal Affairs said it was 6,000.
Report: Obama's campaign was considering a Biden exit in favor of Hillary Clinton.
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama's closest advisers were secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 electoral roll.
This is the most exciting revelation of Mark Galperin and John Heilmann's highly anticipated 2012 campaign book, "The Stakes Are Doubled: The Game Has Changed 2012".
The Times received a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday night that the president's closest aides conducted "large-scale focus group research and public opinion polls in late 2011" to assess whether Biden's removal could help raise Obama's fading hopes for re-election.
According to The Times political columnist Jonathan Martin, the book details the attempts of senior campaign and White House officials, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to assess the effect of former Secretary of State Clinton's appointment as vice president on the vote.
The possible replacement was a closely guarded secret at the Chicago campaign headquarters and the Oval Office.
Only six of the president's closest advisers  including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Pluff  knew the replacement was being considered.
The book Double the Stakes claims that Daley was the one who initiated the attempt to replace Biden, despite their "close personal relationship", but ultimately backed out when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral roll would not significantly improve Obama's chances.
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I have been very vocal in favour of a lot of things being considered, and this was one of them", he told the Daily.
You have to remember, the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we were like, "Oh my God, what are we going to do?"
While Daley described the study as "a necessary check", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the campaign had invested a lot in studying whether the move would pay dividends on the vote.
"Campaign headquarters don't spend that kind of money on polls and focus groups unless they're serious about something", Martin said on AK 360.
It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was exploring a replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then-boss knew about the possible rearrangement.
While Daley said he didn't think the president was aware of a possible replacement, the former administration chief admitted that Obama "may have known".
Martin added that "Double the Stakes" does not provide a clear answer to the question of whether the results of political probing reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed Obama was unaware of the study's ability to remove Biden from the electoral roll.
"Maybe", said Martin.
You want a glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first ice cream that glows in the dark using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of the sea animal to develop glowing food.
He came up with this idea after reading a scientific paper on jellyfish, and he convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue of the person who eats it, raising the pH of the protein and making it glow.
Chris says that because ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat in your mouth, it means that the more you lick it, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company, "Lick Me, I'm Delicious", says, "This is an incredible thing, but it's still in the very early stages of production, so for £200 you get about two grams of stuff".
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, it raises the pH and the ice cream starts to glow.
We've been testing it for the last few months, and it seemed like it would be perfect for Halloween because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the jellyfish's fluorescence is four times more expensive than gold.
So each balloon costs me about £140.
But it tastes pretty good.
Charlie's Bristol-based experimental company is known for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and the taste of goldfish.
But his next creation should be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to design invisible ice cream".
That's not possible by definition because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do that.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Vladimir Chebaturkin, coach of "Avangard", speaking about the preparation of his team for the regular championship match of the KHL against "Salavat", noted that the Oymis carried out a thorough analysis of the defeat against the Magnitogorsk "Metallurg".
The expert stressed that "Avant-garde" needs to pay more attention to the game in defense.
We watched the video of the match against the Magnitogorsk "Metallurg", - quotes the official website of "Avangard" words of Chebaturkin.
- We missed a lot of pucks, not a good time.
Missed because of their mistakes, because of their failure to complete a game assignment.
We knew the competition had performers.
Statistically, they had five hits in a row, three of which we got.
That's a very good execution.
Were those mistakes factored into the preparation for tonight's game?
Me and the guys, we're going over every game, talking after the game, preparing for the next one.
The important thing is that the installation is done.
Everybody saw the first period against Metallurg.
The game was over and the score was 2-0.
We missed the goal in the locker room and in the third period we started to make mistakes.
Given how hard the game was going, I didn't see the point of bringing in the guards.
We need to protect the whole team.
Now the Avangard have a long home series, the games are another day - the team has accumulated fatigue?
All teams are on equal footing.
The important thing now is to realize your moments and complete the game mission.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you play the setup, it's not that hard.
Because of new rules imposed by the Russian customs, hundreds of trucks have been waiting in line at the Russian border for almost a week.
Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and install bio-toilets .
Hundreds of trucks piled up at the border crossing points.
This situation arose due to the change in the rules of customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officials confirm that the Russian side is creating the queue, which did not warn about the new features in advance.
From October 28, Russia's customs authorities began to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, - said Vladimir Denisov, deputy head of the Eastern Customs.
The new model is applicable in countries that have joined the Convention on International Carriage.
The checkpoints are operating at a high level.
The FACTS correspondent visited the border and spoke with the truck drivers who were hostages.
Prices at the roadside coffee shop at the Novoazovsk checkpoint are rising every day, as is the queue for the van.
The trucks are lined up in several rows, stretching about two kilometers.
The Novoazovsk-Veselo-Voznezenka customs terminal provides one of the most important transportation routes from the south of Ukraine along the international motorway.
From here, cargoes are sent to Russia's Stavropol region, Kazakhstan, Georgia, and Armenia.
On Sunday, they were still allowed to drive until midnight, and then they introduced these rules, - complains truck driver Alexey Golovanev (pictured), who is transporting cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan by transit through Russia and has been sleeping in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, I need an extra package of documents and insurance to cross the border.
The amount depends on the cost of the cargo and the distance it is transported.
The minimum insurance is 4,5-5 thousand rubles (about 1100-1300 hryvnia).
Those who travel nearby (say, to Georgia, Armenia) with cargo worth up to $50,000 pay about $15,000 and drive.
And the rest of us are stuck, because no one has that much money with them!
Imagine that a driver is transporting a cargo worth only four thousand dollars, but all the way to Moscow, he needs to pay 90 thousand rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnias) for transit!
The conditions for survival at the border are nonexistent, complains truckers who eat near their cars.
It's always expensive in border shops and cafes, but we've never seen prices like this!
The sellers were quick to point out that a bar costs 15 hryvnia, a cup of coffee costs seven hryvnia, and a bowl of soup costs 25 hryvnia.
And the cafe is alone.
And there's no toilet.
We sleep on the steppe, go to the toilet there.
No washing or shaving...
I can't get out of my car for a week. My wife's got it all lined up.
For a week, says another truck driver, Viktor Skotarenko.
But will my car get a week's supply?
Why do you have a gallon of water?
There are 11 and 15 hryvnia.
What, is the bottle crystal or is the water silver?
We're a coffee shop, not a store.
"Take it while you still have something", the saleswoman says.
After the situation was covered in the media, the authorities of the region drew attention to the plight of Ukrainian drivers.
The leadership of the Amvrosiyev and Novoazov regional state administrations received instructions to provide drinking water to all who stand in line at the Ukrainian-Russian border, - said Sergey Dergunov, acting chairman of the Donetsk regional state administration.
There are ambulances on duty at the checkpoints.
There will also be biot toilets for people to use.
According to the official, the queue problem will be solved in the coming days.
As reported by the press service of the Donetsk regional state administration, as of October 31, 32 and 68 cars were parked at the international checkpoints "Uspenka" and "Novoazovsk".
FACTS will be monitoring the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow of trying to defame Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking officials of Lithuania and the Eastern Partnership countries - the statement to the BNS agency made in the department of state security of the republic (DGB).
The information is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, Moscow is going to "talk" to Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and publish falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian State Archives that relate to facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the special service, the preparation of the information attack is carried out by the Department of analysis of public processes of the administration of the President of Russia on interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries.
The structure is headed by Evgeny Umerenkov, who has visited Lithuania several times and participated in the Lithuanian People's Party Congress.
Also a participant in the operation is allegedly a departmental employee V. Smirnov.
According to the intelligence service, Smirnov had been visiting Lithuania regularly until the end of 2012 under the guise of his scientific work and had been in contact with local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Now Smirnov is banned from entering the country.
The day before, Lithuanian President Grybauskaitė announced that she was aware of a cyberattack on her.
According to her, the main reasons are Lithuania's successful chairmanship of the Council of the European Union and "the country's desire for energy independence".
The Lithuanian leader has previously criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
She said that the Kremlin did not treat Lithuania with "enough respect".
In addition, Gribauskaitė accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of making "only one demand" to Lithuania.
In September, the Rospotrebnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian "milk" to Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the products did not meet sanitary and epidemiological standards.
The Lithuanian leader then said that if Russia did not lift the ban, the country's government should prepare an appeal to the WTO.
In the United States, a school principal shot teenagers.
The principal of one American high school was literally left to his own devices.
The man, he said, was forced to take a gun and start shooting.
The incident happened in Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, juvenile hooligans threw toilet paper at a man's house.
The school principal opened fire on the teenagers, causing a 15-year-old boy to suffer multiple injuries to his leg and arm.
Since the hooligans were not on the property of the director, he was charged with aggravated assault.
A man was released from prison on $ 125,000 bail.
Shooting civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
Just the day before, a man opened fire in downtown Ridgecrest, California, on a pedestrian.
The perpetrator then took two passersby hostage, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
Earlier today, a shooting occurred at a Newtown, Connecticut elementary school.
Adam's mother worked at the school, she was a teacher.
Shooting at American school: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident occurred on January 31 at an American school, this time in Atlanta, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late, and perform masquerades for our neighborhood.
I'm more of a cleaner now.
I haven't been called in to hand out candy in my apartment in the last two years, and I probably won't be this year.
But statistics show that I'm a white crown when it comes to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans  158 million  will celebrate Halloween this year and will spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and jewelry.
The only thing I look forward to every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent will be spent on suits.
This year, the highlight is the sexless.
Women no longer have to be sexual professionals; they can also be sexual food, like pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for the men, I think we're going to see a lot of zombies because of The Walking Dead, and I'm sure that astronauts like Daft Punk will be on our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most searched suits are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year, and to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
In fact, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million on pet suits this year.
That means a lot of funny stray dogs.
When it comes to candy, we're not small.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
That's about 600 million pounds of Hershey's candy, candy, Milk Duds, chewing gum Twizzlers and Clark Bar bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million candy-craving children who are preparing to invade our neighborhoods.
What's more, we'll buy and - don't kid ourselves - eat 90 million pounds of chocolate on Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to eat is corn candy; and yet, according to the National Association of Candy Makers, nearly 35 million pounds of it is sold on Halloween.
That's about nine billion individual corn kernels.
It's a mystery I have yet to solve.
Nothing expresses Halloween more than a haunted house.
They have amazing names, like "Fear Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Howl and Scream" and "House of Shock".
In addition, according to America Haunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in America, generating about $500 million in revenue, plus those amazing photos of you almost showing up that your friend posted on Facebook and you can't seem to get rid of, and then the guy you like sees that photo and leaves a comment like, "Cool face".
And finally, let's talk about the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a Jack's lamp is like decorating a Christmas tree, something we've been doing since we were kids.
Fortunately for us, the pumpkin baby craze only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these pumpkins, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins this year.
Jack's lamp that's slowly drying on your porch probably came from Illinois, which has grown 542 million pounds of pumpkins this year.
If you want a more challenging task, visit Tim and Susan Mathison in Napa, California, and try cutting something out of their 2,032-pound pumpkin.
Estonian Defense Ministry website restored after attack by Ukrainian hackers
The Estonian Ministry of Defence's website has been restored after the cyber attack, the ministry's press service said.
According to Defense Ministry Information and Administrative Vice Chancellor Taimar Peterkop, it was a primitive attack, the site was simply overloaded with a large number of requests.
Our specialists quickly got things back on track, and the site is now back up and running.
"The damage done to the ministry is minimal", Peterkop told the Postimees.
Peterkop says it's too early to say who did the attacks.
"We will definitely analyze the causes of the incident and draw our conclusions, but it is impossible to prevent such incidents completely", he admitted.
On November 1, Anonymous Ukraine posted an online appeal confirming a hacker attack on the website of the Estonian Ministry of Defense and opposing Ukraine's partnership with NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be NATO's servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member states.
Ukraine does not need the NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia.
Ukraine should not be anyone's slave.
We are for an independent Ukraine.
"Hands off Ukraine", Anonymous said in a statement.
Earlier, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry reported that the Marine Company of the Feodosiya Separate Battalion of the Ukrainian Marine Corps will take part in the NATO Steadfast Jazz-2013 command and staff exercises.
The demonic force riot forced the closure of several schools and hospitals.
Four schools in Zimbabwe's Southern Matabeleland province have been forced to close due to pupils being attacked by... goblins.
The local elder explained that the children panicked and could not continue.
The goblin story may sound like a child's fiction to a European, but in Africa, it's a pretty strong argument for closing a school.
Adults are afraid of evil too.
In the summer, for example, a hospital in Zimbabwe was closed because of goblin attacks on medical personnel.
Land Rover racing series announced
Inside are racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as an internal communication system.
Additionally, you can get upgraded brakes, a service package that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and car storage between events.
Drew Bowler, the managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The rally drivers who are applying to Bowler have changed".
Some of them aren't experienced racers, but people looking for excitement, adventure and access to world-class events.
We are delighted to offer this route in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe this format offers a new way to try out different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad, as well as preparing participants for the harsh conditions and realities of rally racing.
We've been very excited to develop the Defender Challenge car  it's going to be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to participate in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian security forces don't know anything about the Brotherhood - New News
This is reported by INTERFAX.RU with reference to a source in the Russian law enforcement.
"After media reports emerged that the US Treasury Department had put Leps on a watch list for alleged membership in the Eurasian crime syndicate 'Brotherhood Circle', we searched all databases but found no such group", the source said.
He believes that the spread of this information contributes to the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As reported by NE, yesterday the US Treasury Department published a list of suspected members of the Brotherhood criminal group on its website.
Among them was named Russian singer Gregory Leps.
He's listed as "Grish", posted the day before.
They match the data of a popular Russian singer.
His name is Gregory Lepssevridze, his creative pseudonym, and his place and date of birth.
Besides Leps, there are five other people mentioned.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another ex-USSR national, whose nationality is not specified.
The U.S. believes that Gregory Leps, who lives on Phuket Island, was transporting money for the bandits.
The message is accompanied by a photograph of the singer and all his data, which correspond to reality.
In fact, Leps did recently buy a house in Phuket.
The department said it intends to impose sanctions on Leps.
Putting a person on the US Treasury blacklist means that their assets in the US are blocked and that anyone living in the US cannot do business with them.
Leps' assistant Maya Serikova said no notification had been received: "It's difficult to answer the question of whether this is the Grigory everyone is talking about now in connection with the scandal in the US".
All Leps knows is the media.
Officially, he's never been notified personally, although I don't know if he's been notified in these cases.
"And of course, it's all funny on the one hand and surprising and unexpected on the other", she told RIA Novosti.
She said Gregory Leps does not live in Phuket, but the U.S. Treasury Department claims he does have a house on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps was on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news had reached him during a flight to the city of Blagojevich.
Running out on the field in a match against Shinnick
Some details about the fan who ran out on the field during the match 1/16 of the final of the Cup of Russia between Yaroslavl "Shinnik" and Moscow "Spartak" became known.
As the head of the Russian Football Federation's KDK Artur Grigoryants stated, citing the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this fan is a Muscovite.
He's in custody at the moment.
"In addition, Grigoryants told how the fan managed to break through on the field: "It turned out that this one, let's call him a spectator, went to the ambulance accompanied by two spectators, citing heart problems.
He went to the ambulance, the EMT confirmed.
And then he pushed the two men away and ran to the field.
He ran from the corner of the East and South stands to the corner of the East and North stands.
He ran across the field.
That's the stewardess' responsibility.
Until the Sports Act comes into effect, this is a steward's area - the police can't interfere with what's on the field.
He ran to the grandstand, climbed over the East Stand.
And at that time, riots began on the Eastern platform and on the running tracks", - said the head of the KDK.
We remind that by the decision of the Moscow KDK, Spartak will hold the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the Russian championship against "Lokomotiv" and "Zenit" without spectators, and will also pay a fine of 600 thousand rubles.
Fire crews were called to rescue a lost puppy that was trapped 50 feet above the ground on a dangerous slope in a quarry.
Ruby the Cocker Spaniel escaped after a minor car accident.
Three days later, she was trapped in the quarry when a man walked her dog.
Firefighters climbed down a steep slope to save the dog from imminent death.
The puppy was lucky enough to escape after fire crews were called to pick him up and take him to safety after he was somehow stuck 50 feet up a dangerous slope.
Nine-month-old Ruby the Cocker Spaniel ran away after being involved in a car accident on Sunday afternoon, and spent three days alone before being rescued from the quarry on Wednesday.
Her owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, were at the Flappit quarry in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were frantically searching for their missing dog and posting messages on social media after she ran away to the quarry after a minor accident.
At approximately 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a keen dog handler spotted Ruby stuck at 50 feet on a ledge in a quarry.
A technical rescue team from the Clackheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene, descended on ropes to save Ruby, and used a stretcher to lift her up the hill.
Rescue specialist Andy Clayton said she was in a dangerous position.
It was right in the middle of a steep slope  50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during the rescue, she was completely frozen.
But she's fine now.
Then she ate the cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is incredible.
Rescue specialist officer Peter Lau said: "Ruby is very lucky to have been rescued".
There was a chance she could have sustained a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for an examination, and she was found to be fine, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Mrs Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was scary to watch the rescue.
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when we got her back.
The vet said if she had fainted and passed out, she'd probably have fallen.
The firemen were great.
It was very brave what they did.
We're so grateful, and each one of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr Alderson, from Keatley, added: "We were afraid it might fall, but it stayed there".
The firemen were amazing.
I just can't believe she ended up there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't flirt with Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was the backing vocalist for Jagger's 2004 song Old habits die hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a veteran rocker, and she remarked, "He flirted with me when I was 18".
She added: "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind".
In a statement Thursday, a spokesman for Jagger, 70, said he "categorically denies ever having ever hit on Katy Perry".
The spokesman added: "Maybe she's confusing him with someone else".
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted at number one this week.
George Karevan: The break with Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another scarecrow about independence.
This time we are being warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the European Free Movement Area as a condition of EU membership.
Next up, the passport control in Berwick and the barbed wire border along the Adrianov Wall.
Strathclyde newspaper did point to the potential economic benefits of more free movement in the rest of Europe, though  predictably  it didn't make the headlines.
Nor did anyone point out that EU member states spend a lot of time twisting their formal rules to suit themselves.
Since Scotland is not now part of the Schengen area, continuing to disregard the requirements would be a cheap concession for Brussels in exchange for what it really wanted from the Scots.
So this is not a story worth telling.
And it's so old that it's turned into a fossil: I first heard about the idea that "independence means passport control" at least 40 years ago.
And yet there's an interesting moment that's lost in the retelling of an old fairy tale.
Why should an independent Scotland ever follow the orders of Europe?
Why trade the yoke of London for the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the great postwar plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the euro crisis, the Europe project is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or in favor of abolishing the euro as a single currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party Alternative for Germany  founded just this year emerged out of nowhere and won almost five million votes in the September federal election, thereby effectively ousting the Free Democrats (analogous to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There was always internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has been a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the shackles placed on national economies by maintaining a single currency, have led many to think that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits,  this was true only for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has locked its members in exchange rates that are good for German exporters, which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluing the national currency, southern Europe is at a pre-existing disadvantage in terms of production capacity compared to Germany.
The only way to save them is to cut wages and public spending, which Berlin is actively supporting.
The current budgetary and currency problems are caused by a deeper problem of Europe's productivity.
As a result of the "green energy" package put in place by Brussels, a code that means subsidies to French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers, European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as in the US.
It's paralyzingly unfavorable pricing conditions, as we've seen at Greengrove.
No amount of wage freezes in the world will stop the crushing victory of cheap U.S. shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
The result is a riot, especially in France, once the most ardent supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on a par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policies on Europe, leaving France's ruined economy in a dire position.
The result  the right-wing, anti-EU Marine Le Pen party National Front has just won a decisive by-election, pushing the ruling Socialist Party to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote, a timely warning to British Labour that it cannot assume that a split on the right will automatically favour the left.
What is Le Pen doing with his newfound popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If - and this is very likely - anti-EU parties win support in this election, such a bloc could for the first time dominate the European Parliament.
My view is that the growing anti-EU sentiment and the anti-monetary sentiment in Europe will soon merge to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something like the vague Europe of nations that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and a few dependent economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will reinstate their own currencies.
I'm guessing the UK is distancing itself from this project, hoping to get closer to the US.
Yet Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests the likelihood of Britain being left unattended in the cold Atlantic.
What does that leave Scotland in?
We can choose to become a region of (in essence) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect Scotland can succeed in a freer European arrangement provided we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway's experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party government in Scotland is  strangely  the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity, winning an overwhelming majority in 2011 thanks to objections to spending cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the emerging Tory-Liberal Democrat coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence now just to accept the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: aging earlier
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers, studies show.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is near
There's no evidence of hormones or other chemicals.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the triggers of early puberty
The tendency to early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheringe is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be alarmed if her daughter begins to develop breast lining and pubic hair at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and are the new norm.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring my parents, which usually doesn't mean full puberty is coming soon", Kaplowitz said.
The obvious developmental signs, such as growing breasts, pubic and underarm hair, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there's been only a slight shift in the age of menarche over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 years in 1970.
"After breasts start to develop, it takes at least two to three years before menarche", said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of "Early puberty in girls: how to cope with this common problem".
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress.
There is debate about what constitutes actual onset of puberty, but it is considered "premature" when breast enlargement is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth until 8 years of age.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop - something that the pediatrician can monitor closely.
A faster progression may be a reason for an endocrinologist to check for serious problems, such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to slower growth and lower growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for medication or hormone therapy are based on the child's age, developmental level, growth rate and emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about medication, but acknowledges that "repressing puberty can alleviate behavioural problems and girls' feelings of being different from their peers".
The other big problem is obvious: parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene issues", Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock", recalls a woman whose daughter started menstruating at age 10.
Although she had the symptoms and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was first among her friends.
There are many popular theories about the causes of premature puberty.
Yet, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the most important premise is an obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study of girls ages 6 to 9 that linked body fat to puberty.
Other data support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In that country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
There are various explanations.
Worldwide, early puberty seems to be influenced by everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery is that although boys develop facial and eyebrow hair at a younger age, the tendency to reach full puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of this topic.
Acne and pubic hair can occur even in infants and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we define the true onset of puberty", said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Gorrieb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be ashamed to ask their pediatrician for guidance on how to talk to their child.
"It could mean an earlier conversation than expected", Kaplowitz explained.
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who come out early need reassurance that even when it happens sooner than it should, it's a normal part of life.
The American Boeing is preparing to take off from Chita .
The American aircraft, which was observing the Russian territory under the Treaty on Open Skies and made an unplanned landing in Chita on Wednesday, will leave the city's air harbor on Friday, November 1, at 8:30 a.m.
The airport authorities gave permission to take off, after receiving money for fuel.
The airport said the plane will be leaving for Ulan-Ude.
Other reports say he's headed for the United States.
As reported, the plane flying to Ulan-Ude landed in the Transbaikal region due to fog.
He was not released from Chita Airport because of unpaid bills.
The plane is carrying 30 people, including the crew, who spent two nights at the airport, ITAR-TASS reports.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, according to the terms of the Treaty on Open Sky, people on board the aircraft do not have the right to leave the Chita airport, they can pass border control only in two airports of Russia - in Kubinka and in Ulan-Ude.
The Treaty on Open Skies was signed in 1992 and includes 34 states.
Observation flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the USA, Canada, Europe.
The Treaty's main objectives are to promote transparency, facilitate monitoring of the implementation of agreements in the field of arms control, and expand the capacity to prevent and resolve crises within the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do deceased celebrities earn ?
The list of the highest-earning celebrities alive in 2013 was headed by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But it was overtaken by the late Michael Jackson, whose death-related income from October 2012 to October 2013 was $160 million.
Other deceased celebrities are significantly behind him, having earned several times less last year.
The second most "wealthy" celebrity in the Forbes list of the richest people in the world is Elvis Presley, with $55 million, and the author of the Peanuts comic book series, Charles Schulz, with $37 million.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, who was the leader last year (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million) made the top five.
Also on the list are Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein.
Igor Gulayev 's first boutique opened in Moscow
On October 23, Igor Gulyaev's first flagship boutique was opened in Moscow.
Designer Igor Gulyaev is known to the public for his luxury fur products.
And now even more fashion fans will be able to appreciate them - in Moscow finally opened its first boutique, for which the designer organized a party in the style of dolce vita.
I'm sure that in Russia live the most beautiful girls.
So I'm especially happy that I opened a store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there's a part of me.
With these words, Igor cut the red ribbon and invited everyone to try on the models!
Jet aircraft manufacturers are at odds over seat width when big orders are at stake
A fierce dispute erupted between the world's leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of passenger seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a fierce confrontation at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The debate revolves around the width of seats provided on long-haul flights to economy class passengers, whose interests are not always in the focus of airlines, although the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in the claims about the efficiency of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would require a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy class cabins, but its main American competitor Boeing says that should be up to airlines.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell ever larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, with potential record orders expected at the event on November 17-21.
The layout of the rear of the aircraft  especially whether it seats 9 or 10 people in a row  is central to the claims of economic efficiency of new mini-aerobuses projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will seat 406 people, based on economy class seats over 17 inches wide, placed 10 in each row.
Airbus says a competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch-wide seats arranged nine in a row.
Aircraft giants often exchange technical hits with advertising in the professional press.
And now Airbus is speaking directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to lead the way with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what a new advertising war could be like by showing a slide to financiers showing three people in a restaurant clutching at each other, titled "Would You Agree?"
Boeing offers long-haul flights in seats narrower than those on regional turboprops, said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
People gain weight as their diets change, but airplane seats don't change dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set the standard for modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American man between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
The waist circumference of the average 21st-century American male is 39.7 inches, according to the U.S. Public Health Service.
Airbus claims that its competitor is following the seat concept of the 1950s, when the average waistline of what was recently called the "reactive audience" was already.
Airbus says it commissioned a study showing that an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus' seat size figures and says manufacturers should not interfere with airlines' decisions on how to balance fares and convenience.
She says research shows that the comfort of the cabin is not just a function of the width of the seat.
"It's really about giving airlines the choice and the opportunity to do what they think they need to do to succeed", said Kent Craver, Boeing's salon specialist.
They don't want us to decide for them what's good for them.
They know their stuff better than anyone.
For passengers, the issue is more side space, but for suppliers, it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
Behind this dispute is a race for aircraft orders valued at at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades - enough to change the ratio of American to European exports.
As first reported by Reuters in July, the seating arrangement  is what fuels the rivalry in the battle between the latest jet aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 percent one-place increase in profitability in their latest twin-engine long-haul models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's stated characteristics are partially based on a comparison of the 10-seat 777X series with the original 9-seat 777 design solution.
The gain in specific cost decreases when compared to the 10-seat layout currently used.
"The reason Boeing is doing this is to squeeze in more space and make its aircraft more competitive compared to our designs", said Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus' passenger comfort division in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that full 10-seat cabins for existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a compact seating arrangement that can go hand in hand with lower fares.
"Eighteen-inch wide seats would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial standpoint, the Airbus offer is driven by the threat of the 777", said interior designer Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply the seats, but they do offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Jet salesmen traveling the world even carry roulettes to check out competing designs.
While touting comfort, all manufacturers also offer very compact airplanes for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10 rows, but says it hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for additional cabin modifications, offering wider seating in some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern aircraft, experts say, her call for a new industry standard is unlikely to "fly", but could distract from the 777X sales wave.
A new nicotine vaccine may make smoking less pleasurable
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could make smoking less enjoyable.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from lifelong nicotine addiction.
More tests are needed before human trials can begin, which could take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the initial results are encouraging.
"We are very hopeful that this vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit after trying all the methods available on the market today but found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to overcome with these modern means", said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry the genetic information to produce nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady flow of antibodies.
The antibodies track down any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine shock.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice that were then given nicotine continued their normal activities.
And the mice that didn't get the vaccine "relaxed", which is a sign that nicotine was reaching their brains, the researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain high levels of antibodies, injections had to be given so often that they proved expensive and impractical.
But the cost of a new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they have the urge to try cigarettes, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it's more likely to be used by smokers to quit.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they won't get the pleasure from the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them quit", he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research was needed.
Oleynikov: one-third of Moscow suburbs are fully subsidized
Vice-governor of the Moscow Region Yuri Oleynikov stated that almost a third of the rural settlements of the Moscow region are fully subsidized.
In total, 187 of the 288 settlements receive subsidies from the region's budget.
In 2013, 187 of the 288 settlements received subsidies from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the budget revenues of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 are 100% subsidies.
Within the framework of budgetary security, about 25 billion rubles are being allocated from the regional budget", Oleynikov said.
The vice-governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Mytic, Odintsovo and Pushkin - had budget revenues of more than 1 billion rubles in 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million rubles, "this is not enough".
The costs of maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements in the Moscow Region is over 70%, "while the quality of services is decreasing", Oleynikov noted.
Earlier, he had instructed the heads of the municipalities of the Moscow region to think through which settlements need to be enlarged, merged into urban districts or change the administrative management system before the end of November.
These proposals will be worked out by the end of January.
Before that, the governor of the Moscow region said that as part of the administrative reform in the Moscow region, it is planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural settlements.
Also in the Mozhay, Kashir, Solnechnochk, Kolomna, Lubertz and Kotelny districts there is a request for enlargement of municipalities.
The discussion of this issue in the regions will begin in November.
The Chairman of the Moscow People's Assembly Igor Bryntsalov also said that all about 30 rural settlements in 12 districts of the Moscow Region are planned to be united within the framework of the coming administrative reform.
This is due to the fact that of the 178 rural settlements in the Moscow Region, less than a third have an "acceptable" financial base, and 100 are subsidized.
Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children.
Diana Arbenina does not hide her joy in raising her children.
Although Arbenina is now devoting a lot of time to her art and social activities, she still finds an opportunity to hang out with Martha and Artem, and not only does she spend time teaching them, but she also entertains them as much as she can.
In the last week, Diana has twice reported her teaching skills to her fans.
She first posted a picture on Facebook of herself teaching children to read.
And yesterday, she pampered the fans by showing off Artem and Martha for Halloween.
"We're ready for the broom races! our first Halloween!"
This is not surprising, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, are related to this holiday, because they were born in America.
Germany first in Europe to introduce gender-indefinite registration
Germany will be the first country in Europe to allow the registration of children born with hermaphroditism with "not certain" instead of male or female.
The parents of the child will have the right to leave the "sex" column on the birth certificate blank for a period of time.
Instead of "F" (female) or "M" (male), parents may temporarily write "X" (indefinite).
This decision is designed to avoid pressuring parents into a rush to have sex reassignment surgery.
According to statistics, one in 2,000 newborns in the world is born hermaphroditic.
Tripodie denies being influenced by Obey.
Former New South Wales Labor Secretary Joe Tripodie will be the subject of an investigation by the state's anti-corruption watchdog.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodie has denied changes to the lease of waterfront properties at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who secretly owned shares in three properties on state land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr Obeid lobbied several state ministers to renew the lease on Serkyular Key, where the Obeids own two restaurants and a cafe, without passing a tender after it expired in August 2005.
She's now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripoddy knew of Mr. Obeid's secret involvement in the real estate holdings, following testimony from Mr. Tripoddy's former deputy chief of staff Lynn Ashpool on Thursday.
During several years of discussions, beginning in 2005, the government insisted that the lease be put out to open competition.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer lease terms.
In 2009, the lease of the enterprises on Serkylar Ki, which brought the Obey family about $2.5 million a year, was extended without an open competition.
Mr. Tripody, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripody admitted, had urged changes to the government's rental policy.
The ICAC's transcript of the phone calls showed conversations in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripody and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the Port Authority after working under Mr. Obeid in the fisheries department.
"Was the issue discussed during these telephone conversations a question of the development of commercial rental policy?" asked Commissioner Anthony Wiley's assistant, Mr Tripody.
"No", said Mr. Tripody.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not that.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
According to a senior official, Israeli warplanes are attacking targets inside Syria.
A senior administration official confirmed in an interview with Fox News that Israeli warplanes struck a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night.
The official didn't specify what the target was, but said at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was a Russian-made SA-125 missile.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel has carried out airstrikes on missile cargoes inside Syria.
Foreign workers with subclass 457 visas can be tested for authenticity.
The "authenticity" test for foreign workers on the 457 visa is under consideration by the government as it provides for more repressive measures.
This test, if passed, would be applied on criteria designed to prevent the use of Class 457 visas to fill unskilled positions or as a loophole to move family and friends to Australia.
The document submitted by the government for discussion was published today as former Labour MP Maxine McKeown criticised the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.
Loud statements like "foreigners  at the end of the line" and "Australians first" are a very unpleasant throwback to the time when unions demanded a protected labour market, she told the Australia  India Institute today.
Historically, this has meant that white labor has to be protected, and if some in the region see echoes of this historical artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The document presented for discussion sets out 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Secretary Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday to meet with officials on human smuggling, has already made five of the recommended changes, and the rest are under consideration.
If the authenticity criteria are adopted, the visa applicant can be tested for authenticity if the applicant is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or a person involved in the financing of the enterprise.
Businesses may also be required to report on the number of 457 visa holders, as businesses that had previously sponsored a small number of workers would have hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of an apparent heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The man's grieving nine-year-old son was accompanying him on his journey to Australia, and since his father's death on Wednesday, he has been supported by his cousin, who was also on board the ship.
Australian authorities rushed the man to a hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
Semen Varlamov's girlfriend said the hockey player was an alcoholic
The friend of the hockey player Semyon Varlamov, Yevgeny Vavrinjuk, said that he suffers from alcoholism, reports the Russian News Service.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking", said one woman.
Recall that Vavrinюк sued for beating the goalkeeper of the Russian national team Semyon Varlamov, who is also a member of the club "Colorado".
She said the hockey player pulled her by her hair and beat her, injuring her arms, chest, stomach and neck.
Varlamov himself came forward to the Denver police and confessed to the beating, describing the incident in detail.
He was arrested, but later released on a $5000 bail.
The court did not restrict the athlete's movement around the country, but prohibited him from approaching Vavrinjuk.
He also faces up to six years in prison for domestic violence.
The UK government has announced a study to improve the economic impact for Scotland of the HS2 railway project.
The HS2 project involves the opening of a high-speed link with Scotland and the north of England, with Phase One starting in 2026.
Baroness Kramer, the Minister of Transport, said the project would "unite the UK".
Scottish Transport Secretary Keith Brown said he was "excited" about the prospect of working on the plan with the UK government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase Two is completed, the lines will be extended to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and the north of England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements to the railway's capacity and reducing travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the ability to travel from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal with HS2 is to create a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together".
We're developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are enormous.
Without it, we're going to have a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it's also about connecting cities to each other; across the UK 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get better connections thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland".
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown urged Mr Carmichael to support Scotland's inclusion in HS2.
Mr Brown said: "High-speed rail has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds Scotland's economic weight to the overall argument for high-speed rail across the UK".
So we're excited to be working with the UK government to explore options for a high-speed railway in Scotland, to create benefits for everyone and to continue the Glasgow-Edinburgh railway that the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the results of the study with the British ministers next year and deciding together on our next steps.
Thorium is the new hope for nuclear power?
Governments around the world are still thinking about how to meet their energy needs.
Burning hydrocarbons (where they are) has a negative effect on the climate.
Renewable energy requires large areas to generate.
Nuclear energy is both, but it leaves behind a lot of expensive waste.
Recently, scientists have turned their attention to thorium, another radioactive element in the Mendeleev system.
It is found worldwide, and experts say that its decomposition leaves no waste that needs to be stored for centuries.
The rules for using electronic devices in airplanes in Australia will remain in place for now
Australian airline passengers will continue to be required to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite US measures to ease regulations on these devices.
The Federal Aviation Administration has allowed U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during takeoff and landing, provided they remain in "Flight Mode".
Passengers can already do this during the majority of their flight, but many are annoyed that they cannot access their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are considering the decision, which required American airlines to do a huge amount of work to comply with the new requirements, but have indicated that they have no plans to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was considering the application, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority currently has no specific rules governing the use of electronic devices on aircraft, it said.
This is governed by regulations requiring air carriers to ensure safety at all times and passengers to comply with safety rules communicated to them by crew members.
Virgin, which has already been in discussions with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to expand the use of its onboard Wi-Fi entertainment system, was not opposed to the changes but said it would follow the regulator's guidance.
"We would welcome the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to consider allowing the use of electronic devices because we really think it will improve customer service now that it (the onboard wireless entertainment system) is on our planes", the spokesperson said.
Qantas said it would abide by the rules in place at the time.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no plans to change it anytime soon", she said.
The FAA order applies to American airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly be closely studying the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the order will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to radio interference from mobile devices, and review manuals, training materials, hand luggage regulations and passenger instructions.
Once the airline has verified and confirmed the resilience of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-books and smartphones at any altitude, the FAA said.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, the group recommends that heavier devices be placed under the seats or in the upper luggage compartments during takeoff and landing.
The head of Dagestan will hear extremist lyrics in the Kuban anthem
The football match between Anzhi and Kuban ended in a political clash between the authorities of the Krasnodar region and Dagestan after the fans burned the Dagestan flag and the Kuban anthem sounded differently.
Dagestan's head of state, Ramazan Abdulatipov, on Thursday suggested that republican parliamentarians go to court because the anthem of the Krasnodar region allegedly calls for ethnic strife, in particular, war with the "Basurmans".
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar Territory, it was in our time in 1995 that this anthem was approved.
It's a shame, and no one does.
"Remembering you here as a mother, on the enemy, on the basurman we go to a death battle" - why write such words in the anthem, poison some believers on other believers", - expressed solidarity with Abdulatipov the chairman of the Parliament Hizri Shikhsaidov.
Putin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad .
And now for the news from overseas, namely from Syria, where we learned today that Israel has struck Russian-made missiles reportedly aimed at Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition: to destroy its chemical weapons production by November 1.
This was done as part of a Russian-brokered agreement that allowed the U.S. to not conduct a military operation, which they came close to this summer.
More on the weapons and what they mean for the Syrian president will be told by our chief international correspondent Richard Engel.
Washington has said the Assad regime will be punished for this.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from the poison gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombing, but in the form of a deal brokered by Assad's friend Vladimir Putin.
Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is a milestone.
A group of international experts said Syria had shut down its alleged chemical weapons factories.
A more long-term and difficult task is to destroy tons of chemical weapons and their components.
We understand it's about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say Assad's days were numbered.
I think Assad should go.
The question is not if it will happen, but when it will happen.
He's no longer legitimate and he has to go.
But Assad is staying.
And he feels even more confident.
His troops still use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are dispersed and poorly armed.
His people are being forced from their homes, many are starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The chemical weapons agreement is being hailed as a success of diplomacy, the inspectors have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself has made an impression of being a cooperative man.
Today in Washington, the US ambassador to Syria had to answer some tough questions.
When a child dies of starvation, his mother is hardly relieved that he was not killed by chemical weapons.
Assad is holding.
And he's switching weapons to power.
Russian President creates separate Ministry of Construction and Housing
Russian President Vladimir Putin has created a new ministry overseeing construction and housing and communities and offered to head it to former governor of the Ivanovo region Mikhail Menyu in a personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Men in the residence in Novo-Ogarovo, and Men did not refuse to lead the new department.
Russian President's press secretary Dmitry Peskov explained that all functions related to construction and housing and utilities are transferred to the new ministry from the Ministry of the Region.
Michael Men - son of the famous Orthodox priest, the protoperiarch Alexander Men, graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petrochemistry named after Gubkin.
Since 1995 he has been elected to the Moscow regional Duma from the Sergius-Posadsky district, was a State Duma deputy, first vice-premier of the Moscow region government, vice-premier of the Moscow government.
From 2005 to October 16, 2013, Mikhail Men was the governor of the Ivano-Provincial Region.
Singapore's pawnshops are doing well while the middle class is struggling
In a pawnshop at the Bendemir Shopping Centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalingha puts in a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for her daughter's schooling.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is in it", says Mrs. Amirthaalinga.
Although she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of Southeast Asia  where household debt is rising  is such that ValueMax, where it conducts its deal, became the third pawnbroker listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Jewelry collateral loans  are not only a quick way to get money (S$1,300 in Mrs. Amirthaeling's case), but they are almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Usually, pawnshops in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17  %, slightly higher than the 15.4  % offered at the United Overseas Bank branch, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary and can issue loans faster than banks.
That's why millions of people across the region turn to pawnshops as families feel the pressure of rising living costs and the rapid rise in household and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and cheap credit fueled by free monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to compensate for declining incomes as their economies slow.
This week Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, cited the increase in household lending, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to GDP in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list with 80% of GDP, up from 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about high consumer debt in Thailand, which this week barely emerged from a technical recession.
Thursday's data showed continued declines in exports and weakening consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that as prices rise, people in the middle and lower [income brackets] will look for ways to supplement their income wherever they can", says Song Seng Woon, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The record high gold prices of the past two years have fueled the rush to deposit personal items as people take advantage of the opportunity to cash in on their family jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the items deposited in the 200 pawn shops of the city-state are gold products.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, let's pawn Grandma's gold chain and get it back next month".
In Thailand, the largest lender EasyMoney has seen its customer base increase by up to 20% in recent months.
The growth in the pawnshop business is such that ValueMax, which operates a branch in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand beyond its four stores in neighboring Malaysia, but also beyond Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, ValueMax's CEO.
The company will finance the expansion using 60 percent of the S$66 million raised this week from a Singapore stock exchange listing.
While some lenders have drawn criticism for high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says that the pawnbroker not only offers cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not increase debt directly.
"Customers are mortgaging things they already own, and monetizing personal assets does not increase household debt", she says.
The trust is gaining increasing public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secured funding.
And the lenders are not just for people who are in financial difficulty.
Rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax's offices to deposit gold bars or Rolex watches, which can give up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for short-term commercial projects or investments, or small businesses that need to overcome temporary financial difficulties,  says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money real fast.
Today, the population is concerned not with the number of medical facilities and their status but with the quality of the care provided.
The implementation of the program "Modernisation of healthcare in the Tula region for 2011-2013", the reorganization of medical institutions in our city will create an optimal structure for providing medical care to the population, including gynecological patients, pregnant women and women giving birth.
Thus, after the merger with the hospital, there was even more opportunity to attract specialists from the "NGCB" state medical center for consultations with pregnant women with various pathologies, to conduct additional examinations on the basis of the hospital.
During the implementation of the modernization program, the maternity home's material and technical base was significantly improved, modern equipment corresponding to world standards appeared.
During these years, about 8 million rubles were allocated for the capital repair of the premises, 112 units of equipment were purchased for 42 million rubles.
The neonatal intensive care unit is equipped with the latest equipment.
In the operating room, the "Cell-Saver" is used to collect blood from the wound and return it to the woman after the surgery, avoiding the need for a blood transfusion.
The clinical laboratory diagnostics department is also equipped with modern equipment.
The women's clinic has an electronic registry, and in the near future it is planned to introduce electronic patient records and medical records.
The development of telemedicine has made it possible for gynecological patients, pregnant women, women who have given birth and newborns to consult with regional specialists.
Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechen-born men arrested by French police on suspicion of a series of attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been ongoing since March of this year.
About 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasians.
The gang reportedly ordered prostitutes to a Strasbourg hotel and then beat and robbed them.
The gang leader was a 27-year-old woman from Chechnya who had been convicted.
Bayern defender David Alaba has been named Austria's best player in 2013, the Bundesliga's official website reports.
In this dispute, he outperformed representatives of winter sports, which traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was taken by skier Marcel Hirsher, and the third place by ski jumper Gregor Schlirenzauer.
Last season, the 21-year-old Austrian of Filipino-Nigerian origin helped his team win the Champions League, the German championship and the German Cup, as well as the UEFA Super Cup.
Arshavin 's ex-wife is on vacation with actor Andrei Chadov
The former civil wife of the football player of the St. Petersburg "Zenit" Andrey Arshavin Yulia Baranovskaya is on vacation with actor Andrey Chadov.
Julia is on holiday in Italy with actress Anastasia Zadourovna, her fiancé - figure skater Sergey Slavenov, and actor Andrei Chadov.
Photos of the couple walking together were posted on Anastasia Zadaroshna's Instagram.
This isn't the first time Andrey and Julia have been photographed together.
On October 5, the Post published a photo of the couple embracing on the shore of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, Zenit defender Andrei Arshavin admitted that he lives separately from his civil wife Yulia.
We will remind, Yulia Baranovskaya and Andrei Arshavin were together since 2003, they have three children.
It was recently revealed that Arshavin is dating ex-model Alyssa Kazmina.
Arshavin's new girlfriend was married to a top corporate executive.
A $325 million health rescue package for Tasmania
The federal government insists that the $325 million bailout package for Tasmania's weakened health system be supplemented with strict conditions that ensure the state government does not waste money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth was taking "urgent measures" to prevent a crisis caused by the aging population of this island state, higher levels of chronic diseases and system limitations.
The decision to fund the four-year scheme was made after the government consulted with Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilke.
"The government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures that we believe will address the specific problems facing the state", Ms. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for a blitz campaign on planned operations.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopedic and cataract surgeries, will help to reverse the backlog.
There is also money for outpatient clinics in Hobart and Launceston to improve post-hospital care, train health professionals, mental health services and introduce personal electronic health card systems in local hospitals.
This investment will build on the ideas expressed by leading doctors on how to better support Tasmania's healthcare system,  said Ms Plibersek.
The minister insisted that the Tasmanian government would operate in a strictly accountable manner.
The state will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth funds, and report monthly on where it spends those extra funds.
A three-person commission will be formed to ensure that staff provide services as efficiently and effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million will do nothing unless followed by genuine reform that will put Tasmania's healthcare system on a more sustainable footing.
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first addressed to the prime minister in early May.
"I hope the federal aid package will go a long way in bringing the state's health care system out of a critical state", said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional selection procedures largely offset recent cuts.
But the federal opposition health spokesman, Peter Dutton, believes today's statement is a "patch-like solution".
"The reason we're here is because the state's Labor government has siphoned $430 million off the health care system", he told ABC TV.
When the state government is pulling almost half a billion dollars and the commonwealth is putting in 300 million, you can't pretend that's good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Mrs. Plibersake to ensure that not a single dollar of the bailout package is spent on additional red tape.
Guillaume Niclou's adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot boasts exceptional staging and historical detail, but it is also more heavily perceived than it should be.
Set in 1760s France, the film tells the grim story of Susanna, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she begins to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of a sadistic landlady and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never descends to vulgarity or sensationalism and that's the problem.
Because of its seriousness, storytelling risks becoming a test for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production facilities, says monitoring group
Syria has destroyed major chemical weapons and poison gas ammunition production facilities, an international monitoring group said on Thursday, as fierce clashes raged in the north of the country near one of the facilities believed to store toxic substances.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people had been killed since the country's civil war began nearly three years ago.
The statement from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
The deadline of 1 November, set by this Hague-based organization, for Damascus to destroy or render inoperable all chemical weapons production facilities and the mechanisms for mixing chemicals with poison gas and filling them with ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destroying the equipment means Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of its existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemical substances and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve agent sarin.
The statement came amid fierce fighting Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts believe is home to a chemical weapons production facility and storage facility, the Britain-based Syrian Centre for Human Rights said.
An activist group that tracked casualties through its activist network in Syria said on Thursday that 120,296 people had been killed.
Of these, 61 067 are civilians, including 6365 children.
On the government side, the group said, 29,954 people are members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah fighters.
Also among the dead, the statement said, were 2202 army deserters and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
According to a UN estimate on July 25, 100,000 people have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
That number hasn't been updated since.
The conflict has forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's forces have been fighting rebels in Safir for weeks, many of whom are linked to Al Qaeda.
The center said Thursday there were casualties on both sides, but gave no specifics.
The fighting highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who are being pushed back by the tight deadlines of their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of an ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works closely with the United Nations, said its team was "now satisfied that it has inspected and seen destroyed all critical production facilities and mixing/fueling equipment declared by Syria".
She added that "no additional inspection activities are currently planned".
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspections, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two sites for security reasons, inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that both sites were, according to Syria's statement, "abandoned and... the items of the chemical weapons program contained therein were moved to other declared sites which were checked".
It was not immediately clear whether the Safira site was one of two sites that OPCW inspectors failed to visit.
Syria has presented a plan to completely destroy its chemical weapons, which is due to be approved by the OPCW executive committee next month.
"I applaud the courage and bravery you all have shown in the most difficult mission this organization has ever undertaken", said Director General of the monitoring group, Ahmet Uzumcu, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
For the third year in a row, the civil war has pitted the mainly Sunni rebels against Assad's government and its security forces, which are made up of members of his Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
As for other developments, the head of the center, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a powerful explosion on Wednesday at an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over the conviction of Bali attackers
Survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the verdict of the last of the conspirators to appear in court, and said that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in setting off the explosive devices used in the attack.
He can be released in 15 years if he gets parole.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of the mass murder of two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured dozens more.
He was also found guilty on a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of church bombings across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors demanded life in prison, although they could have insisted that the man dubbed the "submersible" for his reputation as a master explosives maker should be sentenced to death.
The decision has added to the painful memories of Perth mother June Courtin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in a terrorist attack by Patek and his accomplices nearly a decade ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said that Patek should have been put to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
He's to be brought before a firing squad, Ms. Courtin told the AAP.
I have to live every day knowing that I won't have any more grandchildren and I won't see my daughters.
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was set off in a parked van outside just after 11pm on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy's bar when a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After that attack, he fell into a coma for a month and died three times while on life support.
Mr Hughes said Patek must share the fate of three other members of the terrorist cell Jama'a Islamiyah responsible for the bloody massacre, Amrozi, Muhlas and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty more than anyone.
Save his life, well, there's no reason to save his life.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds... that's not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali attackers to stand trial.
He went into hiding for nearly a decade, but was finally apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent revealed that the intelligence evidence showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to reestablish ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
"He didn't give up", said Mrs. Courtin.
Until recently, he had no regrets about the pain he caused others.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be commemorated later this year in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year", says Mrs. Courtin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not call from mobile phones) 
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not talk on their cell phones, according to long-awaited new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect changes to happen immediately.
How quickly such a change is implemented will vary by airline, FAA administrator Michael Werta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they are updating their flight crew training manuals and device placement rules to comply with the new guidelines.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already submitted plans.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of electronic devices very soon", the FAU said.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the door closes.
They must not restart until the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go-ahead.
Passengers should turn off their devices again when the plane descends for landing and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference can allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and takeoff, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Goulding, president of the Professional Stewards Association, welcomed the changes.
Once the new policy is successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win option", Gliding said.
We're frankly tired of feeling like "school guards" when it comes to this.
But surfing the Internet, e-mailing, texting or downloading data will still be banned below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.
So, still no Words with Friends  the smart internet game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when a high-profile incident occurred: the actor was taken off an American Airlines plane for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was at the landing gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will still need to be packed in the trunk, because they can injure someone if they fly around the cabin.
Mobile phone calls in flight will also remain prohibited.
The regulatory authority over phone calls is with the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
The FAA may lift the ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing .
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, the national transportation safety expert for CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are a real problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigation devices, but we know from the FCC that they can interfere with cell towers when the plane is in the air", Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAU to study the issue recommended last month that the government allow more widespread use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has been mounting on the FAU to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, argue that there are no valid safety reasons for the bans.
It is also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce the restrictions as the use of devices has become more widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAU began restricting passengers' use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference to navigation and communication equipment when passengers began to carry FM-radios  high-tech gadgets of the time.
The new airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also being developed and approved by the FAA as resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi at cruise altitude for several years.
Airplanes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners are being adapted to make more use of electronic devices under new guidelines, Wuerta said.
Today's electronic devices usually emit radio signals of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, emit only minimal signals when they turn the pages.
But the signals get stronger as the devices upload or send data.
Among those who sought to ease restrictions on passengers' use of electronic devices was Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company loaded an entire airliner with its Kindle e-book reader and flew it to check for problems, but never found them.
Members of the FAU advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passenger Association said he believes interference from the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there were only isolated reports from pilots confirming that the devices could interfere with aviation systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to require passengers to turn off their instruments during landings in low visibility.
A group of travel industry representatives welcomed the changes, calling them a sensible step toward passengers who now use a variety of technological devices.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and security", said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Schools will be able to conduct driving tests
Private companies with their own computerized driving range will be able to take the driving test.
This is reported by "Kommersant" with reference to the draft government decree "On the admission to driving vehicles".
According to the newspaper, there are now only about 30 such auto races in Russia.
It is assumed that the students of such "privileged" driving schools will be counted on the results of internal testing.
The State Auto Inspectorate will monitor the completion of the exams every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of the theory exams and more than 20% of the site students fail the first time, such a school will be deprived of privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for the motorway, contained in the draft government decree, come into force on November 5, 2014.
The project also contains requirements for training in the driving of two-wheeled vehicles.
From 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners will have to take an exam in urban traffic to obtain an A-category licence.
In addition, from May 5, 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign licenses.
Such workers will have to get Russian driving licenses after passing the exam.
Bird airlifted to safety from North Sea drilling rig released back into the wild
A bird airlifted ashore after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea has been released back into the wild.
This water herder was put on a helicopter bound for Aberdeen last month and then taken out by the Scottish branch of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) at the Alloa Rescue Centre.
Colin Seddon, the centre's manager, said: "This water herder is most likely a winter migrant from northern Europe who has been caught in a high wind zone over the North Sea".
It seems the bird has lost its strength and has taken refuge in an oil tower.
He added: "She was unable to take off again, so we were asked for help".
The water herder was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Are the European elites ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the commitment to bring together business representatives and identify what changes Britain's wealth and job creators want to see in its relationship with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to share their thoughts on Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business leaders representing a broad cross-section of UK businesses by size, sector and region.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking for opportunities to export outside Europe, with a particular focus on countries that are modernizing and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want the government to prioritize new trade links with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than wasting time on the long and difficult process of reforming the EU's tangled institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from antitrust regulation to product laws, most business leaders felt that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives saying that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits of being in Europe's trading zone, with even 40 percent of the largest, traditionally most pro-European companies agreeing.
And last but not least, our survey of business leaders found that the clear majority wants the UK to move towards a change in the treaty and a relationship with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This result, which was seen among businesses of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that business is pushing for a "significant change" that will bring power back to the UK.
The stakes are high  achieving treaty changes and better terms for the UK would provide a 16 percent swing in the vote to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this poll shows that British business supports his plan to revise the terms of UK EU membership.
It also shows that business expects the review to lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.
Better conditions for British business are possible and increasingly necessary as the euro area moves towards closer economic and financial integration.
The priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in the UK, and as our survey shows, for business this means a stronger focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels' regulatory activities.
U.S. intelligence is listening in on the Pope 's personal phone
The Vatican's activities are under the watchful eye of the American intelligence services.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection show that U.S. intelligence has been listening in on all the previous Pope Benedict talks and is now closely monitoring Pope Francis.
His phone was tapped before he became head of the Vatican.
The election of a new pope was also under scrutiny.
Which was a big deal in the States.
The secret service tapped into the cell phones of the cardinals who were meeting in Rome to elect the next pope.
The phones of the residence where the participants lived were also tapped.
American spies were listening in on all the major pretenders to the papal throne to prevent the appearance of a figure Washington did not want.
Panorama magazine reports that "the big ear of the United States" continued to intercept the prelates' conversations until the conclusion of the conclave on March 12.
It is claimed that the United States has since 2005 singled out Argentine Archbishop Bergoglio as the future Pope of Rome.
U.S. intelligence also monitored negotiations related to the election of a new president of the Vatican Bank.
An Italian magazine reports that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives continues to operate at the US Embassy in Rome, extracting information on political and financial flows.
The Vatican, in turn, has conciliatorily declared that it is not concerned about American "tapping", even if it does occur.
The Holy Fathers have no secrets from the United States leadership.
Snowboarder was photographed for Olympic bill
The Bank of Russia on Wednesday issued a commemorative note dedicated to the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
The denomination of the note is 100 rubles.
But bloggers are already making fun of the commemorative note.
After the presentation of the Olympic bill on October 30, they noticed that the snowboarder's image on the bill could be found in photo banks.
Specifically, the free stock exchange photo repository, where this photo is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in a Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website Megaview on January 18, 2011.
It has also been used in RugGear smartphone ads.
The Olympic bill is made in blue-blue.
On one side is a snowboarder flying over Sochi, and on the other side is an Olympic stadium and a bird.
The author of the design of the banknote is Pavel Bushuev, who won the competition among students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts named after Repin.
At the presentation, it was noted that several sports were considered - skiing, freestyle and jumping from a trampoline, but in the end they chose snowboard, as it is a relatively young sport.
According to a source close to the Central Bank, the regulator is not indifferent to the public opinion regarding the widespread dissemination of the image of the snowboarder from the Olympic banknote and is now studying the situation.
But the Goznak are not too concerned about the Olympic bill.
Head of the press service of the State Sign Natalya Nikiforova told "Izvestia" that all the arguments regarding plagiarism are ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the banknote is turned to the right, on the photos on the network - to the left, - said Nikiforova.
The person in the photo shoot for the bill was taken from different points, then the final image was chosen, which was a characteristic snowboarder pose.
She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic bill, as the artist received a salary for his work.
According to experts, the debate around the image on the Olympic bill is quite positive.
The recognition of the image on the note is a plus for its promotion, - says Alexey Popovichov, executive director of the Russian brand.
It is difficult to prove that the images on the bill and in the photo banks are 100% the same, so it is unlikely that a lawsuit will be filed against the image.
The first Olympic banknote was issued in China - a commemorative 10 yuan note was issued for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Russia has decided to continue this tradition.
Legislative bans have made Russians drink less beer
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
They predict that beer consumption in the country will remain at the same level next year, at best.
Although the businessmen initially expected growth.
This year's not going well for them, with sales down 7 percent.
This was stated by the head of one of the largest brewing companies in the country, the chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers, Isaac Sheps, at the III annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute "Trade of daily demand in Russia", which just ended in Moscow.
It discussed government regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already shrunk by 18 percent, as the country has seen a significant increase in regulation of the brewing industry in the production and circulation of beer, a drink with a small alcohol content, Sheps told listeners.
No country in the world has such strict restrictions on the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of new and new illogical prohibitions, which are justified by the supposed fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer lamented that many legislative prohibitions designed to reduce alcohol abuse have not had much impact, yet new initiatives are constantly emerging.
The biggest blow to beer producers was the ban on selling alcohol at kiosks that was introduced this year.
"We lost 35,000 customers in an instant", said Isaac Shepps.
Next year, the brewers have two predictions.
The optimistic one is the one that Sheps talked about: sales of the foam drink will remain at the same level.
Pessimistically, it's going to drop another 2-3 percent.
To maintain their profits, businessmen are forced to move away from mass-market varieties to the "premium" category: beer will be less, but it will cost more.
Meanwhile, the radical effects of the drop in sales of small amounts of alcohol are not yet apparent.
"My observations are that the rate of alcoholism remains about the same", said Dr. Alexey Sotnikov, a drug specialist.
True, the number of patients who use strong-drink substitutes and those who "snap" on tonic drinks like the Jaguar has increased, whereas just a decade ago "beer" alcoholism was dominant.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford automobile plant in Vsevolodsk.
According to the unions, all the people who were laid off got compensation.
But far more urgent than the workers' problems is the question of reducing industrial production in the region.
The deputy of the regional ZAKS Alexey Etmanov at the meeting said that at the factory of the company "Ford" in Vsevolodsk, about 600 people were reduced.
According to him, this happened in September: then, according to the program of voluntary dismissal, which was developed together with the trade union organization, about 600 people left the plant.
Workers who voluntarily resigned were offered "golden parachutes" equal to several salaries.
Because of this, the vast majority of people have left their jobs of their own free will.
However, according to Etmanov, this number of people is a whole night shift.
I think it's going to be more than that.
However, the authorities do not plan to adopt any support programs for the region's struggling enterprises in the next two years", he explained, adding that the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction in jobs when adopting the budget.
Ford has not confirmed or denied this information.
We're waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it comes out, we'll be sure to publish it.
There's been talk of a layoff at Ford's factory in Vsevolodsk for a long time.
For example, the company's plans to lay off 600 people were announced in September.
The plant had previously announced that it was suspending production of cars.
The reason given by the factory was the decline in demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostat, the volume of industrial production in Leningrad Region decreased by 5.4% in the nine months of 2013.
The production of vehicles and equipment fell by 11.5%.
In the US , you can use your cell phone during takeoff and landing .
New rules for the safe use of mobile devices during takeoff and landing have been approved in the United States, reports the BBC.
American airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, with new rules to take effect by the end of 2013.
However, internet access to receive and send e-mail will be prohibited during flights below 3 kilometers.
Because of the danger of interference from aircraft radio equipment, cellular voice communications will still be prohibited.
This will allow airline passengers to read e-books, play games on tablets and other gadgets, and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to check the safety of using electronic devices during flights.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration that they can handle the potential impact of mobile phones on aircraft equipment and controls.
The source said that, following the example of the United States, the UK may also review the current regulations on the use of electronic devices in flights.
The Russian mafia in the United States has finally gotten a new name - the "Brotherhood Circle"
This week, the blacklist of the "Russian mafia" in America has been expanded with four new names and companies.
The U.S. Treasury Department has admitted three Russian representatives, two Uzbek citizens and an Israeli to the "Brotherly Circle".
One of the Russians was the famous singer Grigory Leps, who the United States suspects of transporting money for the group's members.
The US blacklist includes 22 individuals associated with the Brotherhood and six affiliated organizations.
Yet, many experts doubt that such an organization exists.
"The 'Brotherhood' claim is more like an attempt to unite scattered criminal groups", said organized crime expert and New York University professor Mark Galeotti.
In his opinion, the "Brotherhood Circle" reflects the popular perception of the "Russian mafia".
"I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization", quotes Mr. Galeotti from the U.S. Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeotti is also joined by George Mason University professor Liz Shelley.
"If they do act together, it is more like a criminal network than an organization", she is quoted as saying by the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the Brotherhood is more closely aligned with Russian thief-in-law Aslan Ussoyan, known as Ded Hassan.
The criminal authority was murdered in January of this year.
So, the activities of Lasha Shushanashvili and Zakharia Kalashov, who joined the list in 2012, were closely connected with Grandfather Hassan, and another list member, Temuri Mirzoyev, was grandfather Hassan's nephew.
However, Mr. Galeotti notes that some of the individuals are not related to Ussoyan.
He said they were all linked by financial and criminal interests, such as supplying drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion of Grigory Leps - the favorite singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin - in the "Brotherhood Circle" attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American partners, in connection with which a decision was made, why he was included in such lists, - said the press secretary of the head of state Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he's a Russian citizen.
Just like the interests of all Russian citizens, his interests will be protected.
Gazprom chief Alexei Miller says the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sector
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, Gazprom's head said.
"Today marks a landmark event: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun", Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is designed to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which holds much of Russia's gas destined for Europe, is increasing the risk to conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said that a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "eliminated forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced price once the entire project is operational in 2015.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other countries further along the pipeline route by the end of the year.
The annual design capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning in Saratsk, the driver of a Peugeot drove into the opposite lane of the 115 km Odessa-Reni highway and collided with a bus carrying six people.
This is reported by the press service of the department of emergency services in the Odessa region.

Two YMCA employees have been charged with sexual offences before the charges against Jonathan Lord, as revealed by the Royal Commission.
Two YMCA NSW staff were accused of sexual offences against children before charges were brought in 2011 against Caringbach childcare worker Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse said.
But the commission's opening statement said it "never dealt with child sexual abuse within its organization".
Chief Executive Philip Hare was asked about one case where a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and another case where a gym instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual offences against children in his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case but didn't know about the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA in its opening statement to the commission also admitted inaccuracy, claiming that "there have been external audits of the YMCA that have acknowledged that the YMCA is at the forefront of ensuring child safety".
The evidence presented to the commission says that the YMCA was notified that it had received the second of four possible reviews from a quality audit conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that he and lower management failed to properly understand the staff's obligations to report violations of the child safety policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the suggestion that corporate ethics at the YMCA prevented employees from reporting Lord's child safety violations.
Staff testified that they had observed violations, including Lord being alone with the children, personally caring for them, putting them on his lap, telling them that he loved one of them and letting them play with his cell phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under Lord's guidance and asked to be trained in child protection because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that she found Jackie Barnett, the childcare manager of the Caringbach YMCA, who was Lord's supervisor, "very intimidating and often difficult to reach".
The CEO said he did not accept employees' explanations that they were uncomfortable reporting the situation to their superiors.
Rather, he said, their friendship with the Lord kept them from the thought of having to report him.
Mr. Hare said he had presented his view to the NSW YMCA board that the organizational lesson of the Jonathan Lord case did not involve staff information and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to have employees sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations came was made by YMCA child custody director Liam Wheatley.
He said it was to prevent evidence from being tampered with, but it was "overreached" and poorly implemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a child-safe organisation when Jonathan Lord worked there between 2009 and 2011, child abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission.
He said there were "serious problems" in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and controlling staff.
The hearing is adjourned until December 20th.
It's the fashion week in São Paulo.
She is considered not just a model in her homeland, but a real star.
Although Gisele Bündchen has left work for a while to focus on motherhood, she's here on purpose for this week's show.
Her absence of many months did not prevent her from maintaining her place on the podium and the podium.
Giselle remains the highest-paid supermodel in the world.
This time she participated in the parade of the brand "Kolchi".
The fashion week finale is usually the most interesting show.
It's like something that was organized by stylist Lino Villaventura.
The brand has been around for over 30 years, and in parallel with the production of luxury-class pret-a-port, the fashion designer is active in theater and cinema, designing performances and designing costumes for many famous films.
In total, more than 30,000 companies and businesses that are relevant to the textile industry and the fashion world participated in the closing fashion week in São Paulo.
It is one of the fastest growing industries, employing more than two million Brazilians and generating annual sales of $50 billion.
Tony Blair has said he would take the chance to return as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but admits that a return is unlikely.
In an interview the night before, the 59-year-old politician shared his views on various aspects of domestic politics.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after ten years as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his commentary to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the Middle East Peace Quartet.
Asked if he would return to the post of prime minister, Blair, according to London's Evening Standard, said: "Yes, of course, but it's unlikely to happen, so ... "
Milan's head coach Massimiliano Allegri has expressed regret over the draw in the 10th round of the Italian championship against Lazio.
The specialist also noted that the failure at the start was due to a series of injuries of leading players.
I'm very sorry we didn't win", Allegri said.
The team played a decent match, creating 3-4 good chances.
We didn't let Lazio do anything in the first half.
In the second, the Romans added, but overall, I can't say we lost focus.
I should have won.
Last season, we accomplished our goal of reaching the Champions League.
We're behind schedule right now, but that's due to a series of injuries to key players.
Rami and Honda?
They're very good players, with character.
But we're still good.
Look at Kaka, who's had a high-level meeting.
The experts in horse racing who were coming to Cardiff to compete for the Horse of the Year award knew the competition would be fierce.
But no one was prepared for the arrival of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Even though he was not yet a schoolboy, having taken his first steps only a few months earlier, this little boy and his pet Shetland pony, Toffey the Moose, raced through three rounds to easily take the top prize, leaving 30 adult competitors far behind.
This inseparable pair of  equal height  received high marks for their looks, behaviour and style at the annual competition, which is held by the Sunnybank equestrian centre in the town of Radley near Cardiff.
Out in the open, in the midst of men and women in elegant kettle hats, he moved his hat and proudly led two-year-old Toffy around.
The judges praised Fenton for his unusually developed innate ability to handle horses.
And Toffee got the highest marks for his looks and character.
Fenton got a Toffee for his third birthday last March, and he's been training a Shetland pony every day since.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, "Fenton and Toffey make a great duo".
They had a lot of competition, but these two walked away with a gold cup and a rosary.
It was only his second performance with Toffey, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely unknown people in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale in South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for over 10 years.
Mrs Howells said: "The whole audience was amazed and everyone shouted and clapped.
He ran across the sand the entire length of the arena and, although he looked so tiny, he did a great job.
Fenton is crazy about animals. He loves horses and tractors and farms, and he has two chickens to take care of.
Judging by the way he's started, he'll be in the Horse of the Year race soon and I'm sure he'll do well.
A representative of this annual horse show said, "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to handle his pony".
They make a great team.
The judges praised Fenton and Toffey for their looks and the way they presented themselves in the ring.
They're judging the consistency of the pony and the breeder. Fenton and Toffey were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, he looked really good in his role.
The Chinese newspaper that published the call is being reorganized .
A Chinese newspaper that ran a front-page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation should be reorganized, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou newspaper 新快报 made an unexpected public statement asking for the release of journalist Chen Yunzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he took bribes for writing false stories about a state-owned company.
The new express is now subject to a "full error correction process", the regulator said.
The order to "correct" the error came from the Guangdong Administration of Press and Publications, Radio, Cinema and Television.
A preliminary investigation revealed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group-owned newspaper 新快报 published several false reports about the publicly traded company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
The editorial board of the "New Express" was misled, the regulator said in a statement.
He said that the decision was made to "impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yunzhou in the form of revoking his reporter's license".
He also directed Yangcheng Evening News Group to completely correct the errors in the New Express and recommended that it investigate the newspaper's responsible persons and immediately make changes to the New Express' management.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express alleging financial irregularities at a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper published two front-page calls for his release, saying it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television admitting that he had published false articles for money.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn public trust", he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
After Mr. Chen's confession, the New Express published a front-page apology, saying the newspaper failed to properly verify his reporting.
Several high-ranking suspects recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that the practice of confession-busting is still widespread in China, despite recent amendments to laws that prohibit authorities from forcing anyone to confess.
A U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel with its own railroad has been discovered.
One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has been found, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail system.
U.S. authorities described the four-by-three-foot tunnel as one of the most complicated secret passages they had ever discovered.
The zigzag tunnel, nearly six football fields long, connects warehouses near the cities of Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, United States.
This area is filled with hidden warehouses, which makes it easier to smuggle drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were smuggled through, authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcement seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when they discovered the tunnel.
Three men, who law enforcement said were drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
If convicted, they face prison terms ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers are using extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in central Mexico after the marijuana harvest in October, which put drug cartels in a difficult position to quickly deliver their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a 700-yard-long passageway with rail tracks that ran from the kitchen of one of the homes in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Pensions are increasing in Belarus from November
In Belarus, pensions have been increasing since November this year, the main pension management of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection told the correspondent of the BELTA.
From November 1, the average salary of employees in the republic, applied at the previous recalculation of pensions, will be adjusted by increasing its amount by 5.4% and a corresponding recalculation of labor pensions will be carried out in accordance with the decree of October 21, 2013 No. 478 "On raising pensions".
As a result of the recalculation, the retirement pension will increase by an average of 5.3% from November.
The average pension for old age will be Br2 million 295 thousand .
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million people in the country.
The expenditure of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Belarus on the payment of pensions in increased amounts from November this year will increase by Br274,3 billion per month.
At the same time as the recalculation of the labour pensions in November this year, the minimum and social pensions, the allowances, increases and supplementary payments to pensions will be recalculated in connection with the increase in the budget of the average per capita subsistence minimum.
The BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the government in the amount of Br1 million 47 thousand 530 - 2.1% higher than the one in force from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, the minimum wage, social pensions and pensions, increases and additional payments to pensions will be increased by 2.1% from 1 November.
In Belarus , more than Br53 trillion has been allocated to pensions in 2013
British police hand Assange a letter of extradition
British police today issued a notice of extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and sought asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had issued the 40-year-old Australian with a formal demand to surrender and report to the police station, adding that he would be further subject to arrest if he did not comply.
Assange is facing extradition to Sweden on sexual offences charges after he exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his extradition appeal earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, he took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has issued a formal request for the 40-year-old man to surrender, which requires him to report to the police station at a day and time of our choosing, a spokesman said.
He's still in violation of his parole.
The embassy declined to comment on the submission of the police report.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the US to face possible charges of espionage after publishing more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.
A driver driving at 130 miles an hour with a hot drink between his legs is fined £1,000.
The driver was fined £1,000 for driving at speeds of up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to be taken between his legs.
In Colchester Common Pleas, Howie pleaded guilty to reckless driving.
Adding seven penalty points to his driver's license resulted in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay costs of £90 and an additional victim support charge of £100.
A tax on foreign property owners will cause the London bubble to burst.
The Treasury has carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who in the 2012 budget introduced a 7% state levy rate for homes worth over £2 million and annual payments for buyers who choose to own homes in partnership rather than as individuals.
The current residential property tax in the boroughs of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which was £708 million in the 2012/13 financial year, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber combined.
Mr. Cook stated: After the increase in the state tax on expensive houses and the introduction of related anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that the taxation of expensive real estate is undervalued despite the influence of the outdated municipal tax system.
"But this move could make some foreign investors reluctant to buy property in London or its current owners unwilling to sell it", he added.
The value of first class property  the top 510% of the housing market by price  in London's affluent south-west belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen by a record 11.8% in the past year.
According to a study by Savills, prices in central London continued to show a steady rise of 5.6% year-on-year, but were overshadowed by a booming domestic market with price spikes in the south-west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%).
Scientists have shed light on how tail movements affect a dog's mood.
Earlier studies have shown that happy dogs wag their tails to the right (from a dog's point of view), while anxious dogs wag their tails predominantly to the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the canine family can detect and respond to these subtle differences in tail wagging.
"It is well known that the left and right sides of the brain are involved in different ways in the formation of stimuli that trigger positive or negative emotions", says Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at Trent University.
And here we've tried to look at this in other species.
He added that just as in humans, the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotion.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the various tail calls of other dogs, researchers observed the animals as they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the animals' heart rate and analyzed their behavior.
We'll probably soon understand why their tails sometimes point one way and sometimes  the other.
Professor Valortigara said, "We showed the dogs videos of dogs either naturalistic versions or silhouettes to get rid of any other distortion, and we could manipulate the tail movement and move the tail more to the left or right".
When the animals saw that the otherwise silent dog moved its tail to the right (from the point of view of the wagging tail of the dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was leaning mostly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog wagging its tail), their heart rate increased and they looked worried.
Professor Valortigara said that he did not think dogs deliberately communicated with each other using these gestures.
In fact, he thinks that the dogs have learned from their experience which movements they should be concerned about and which they shouldn't.
He notes: "If there are several encounters with other dogs and frequent tail wagging is associated with more friendly behavior and the right side is less friendly, the dog responds based on this experience".
Researchers say these findings may give owners, veterinarians, and trainers a deeper understanding of their pets' emotions.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's veterinary school, said this was not the first study to test whether left and right sides matter to dogs.
Last year, a team of scientists at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when they look at a happy dog.
And in another study from the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: "Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its tail was tilted to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious, the opposite of the Italian study".
He said the differences could be because dogs in different studies didn't fully perceive the animals in the movies or the robot dogs as dogs.
It might be useful to study how dogs react to real dogs, he explained.
While there is ample evidence in different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details remain to be clarified, and dogs are no exception, he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, we will probably soon understand why their tails sometimes point in one direction and sometimes  in the other.
Arctic Monkeys are cancelling their Glasgow show because of Alex Turner 's illness .
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a gig in Glasgow after their vocalist was diagnosed with laryngitis.
This Chevy band was supposed to play at the city's Hydro Concert Ground on Friday.
However, vocalist Alex Turner's illness forced them to postpone the show.
The band's statement came after they were forced to postpone their LG Arena gig in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to move the show to the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and following medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys are also due to postpone the show at the Hydro venue in Glasgow on Friday, November 1".
Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis, and unfortunately, he is unable to speak.

Pope Francis will name the first cardinals in February .
Pope Francis will consecrate new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his tenure on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they elect the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately be involved in choosing his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, once a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer take part in the election of the pope  this is the prerogative of the group of 120 cardinal electors.
In announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that a gathering of all current cardinals, known as a consistory, would be held before the ordination ceremony.
"Pope Francis decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the consistory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from around the world", Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors would likely decline by February.
He said that the pope usually names as many cardinals as he wants to bring the number of cardinal electors back to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The Consistory next year will be of great importance because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March of this year, according to Valero.
At the moment there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe and particularly in favour of Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope appoints cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance", he said.
In South America, forty percent of Catholics are represented by a tiny number of cardinals.
They will also be the first cardinals elected since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with seeking ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad was the one who handled everything.
"Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him", said Valero.
He said it was "quite possible" that Francis would turn to the cardinals for advice.
But we've never been in this situation before... this is the first time for us.
Valero said that popes usually elevate bishops from large parishes to the cardinalate, but Francis is "full of surprises" so we don't know who he will name.
GM is recalling a number of new pickups in the U.S. for re-engineering .
General Motors Co. is recalling nearly 19,000 all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to address issues with manual seatback adjustment, according to a notice from U.S. motor vehicle safety regulators filed Friday.
Some pickups may have a defect in the front seat's back tilt mechanism.
As a result, the seat backs don't meet federal safety standards for head restraints.
If a vehicle is hit from behind, the headrest may not properly protect the driver and passengers, increasing the risk of injury, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website said in a notice.
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
Production of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important launch of a car into series production for the leading American automaker since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM notified the truck owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could not consider notifying owners in connection with the 16-day government shutdown that slowed car sales growth in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were upgraded for the 2014 model year, rose about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups, which were the largest sales in the company's history.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.

Returning to the present is a rude awakening, like being pulled out of a dream.
It's hard to remember those days of optimism... they seem like a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I cast my first ballot, change has really happened.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I give Obama credit for his many great and varied accomplishments, from passing the Affordable Care Act to pulling our troops out of Iraq, repealing the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, to killing Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has blocked too many of our country's efforts to move forward: immigration reform, public health care options, and closing Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But after countless times of standing up for the Obama administration, defending it in front of my colleagues and peers, I'm running out of explanations to give.
I've reached a point of political despair.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain the permission to bug foreign leaders or drone strikes on innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the NSA's collection of data on Americans' private lives or the prosecution of whistleblowers who expose government wrongdoing.
He cannot explain the murder of American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial and investigation or the failure to respect government funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the report's findings that the White House's efforts to silence the media are "the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration".
And recently, he can't justify not being able to develop a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was signed.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Was I supposed to realize at 18 that leadership can contradict the political campaigns that come before it?
Obviously, running for office is not a predictable agenda, because our public dialogue will be shaped by the opposition political party and random events like the Newtown massacre.
However, from all the examples I have listed above, it is clear that they were largely the administration's own choice.
And that's what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was so excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a vague and crude alternative, seemingly incapable of making decisions about his own policies or views.
I thought that in his second term, Obama, free of the pressure of the upcoming election, would live up to the hopes we've heard for so long.
But when Obama's rating dropped below 45 percent this week, it became much harder to go back to 2008 with this book.
It makes me long for so many promises that have gone.
This week I read the part of the book that describes how Clinton inflicted a stunning defeat on Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
At a meeting to analyze the causes of failure, he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to their purpose.
"I want us to get our charm back", he said.
We must remember who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more.
The views expressed in this comment are the sole opinions of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the matter of parental leave.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the matter of parental leave because his daughters could get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining tycoon, who has an outstanding dispute over a $6 million carbon tax payment, made the statement as he tried to avoid questions about whether he had a conflict.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in deciding whether to repeal carbon taxes and mining.
But Mr. Palmer argued that a conflict of interest could only be between ministers, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the policy.
"He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether they get leave", Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the race for the Sunshine Coast seat in the Fairfax electoral district by a 53-vote margin after the recount.
Mr. Palmer has called for a review of the counting process to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should the decision on this election be made two months after we vote?
"We need to have a more perfect system", he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system where you can come in, enter your data into the computer, vote right away and get the result at 6:30 that night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
It seems strange to use a pencil these days.
The Electoral Commission is exploring the possibilities of electronic voting and recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his programme included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and he would take his new job very seriously.
A public office involves service to society.
"We seek no reward except the gratitude of history for being able to serve this district at a critical time", he said.
RBS suspends two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily suspended two traders from its currency operations unit, according to two people familiar with the situation, further confirming that global scrutiny by regulators of alleged manipulation of the currency market is gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world's largest financial market, which has a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
The two traders will be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the ongoing investigation, which echoes the scandal over manipulation of the LIBOR interbank rate.
While declining to comment on the suspensions, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulators this month.
"Our ongoing investigation into this matter is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators", the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people with knowledge of the matter said RBS passed on the email and instant messaging records received and sent by its former trader to the UK regulator  Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and, as far as is known, he has been granted leave from his current position as head of European spot foreign exchange trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Mr. Asher's IM contact group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to people familiar with the matter.
UBS Bank said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged currency manipulation at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators worldwide  European Commission, Finma, Swiss antitrust authority Weko, FCA, US Department of Justice and Hong Kong's Monetary Authority  are reviewing allegations that bankers conspired to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks are going through instant messages and emails over the years looking for cases of wrongdoing.
The news of the inspections has stirred traders in a business that has been one of the biggest sources of revenue for investment bank trading units in recent years, but has struggled this year as low currency volatility has reduced the opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the seriousness of the situation by saying that a large and highly liquid currency market is virtually impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trading in the currency market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the broader use of banks' internal platforms means that "you can start influencing the market for a very small price".
The news comes on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it was laying off a trader in its London Stock Exchange trading unit this week after he caused losses of nearly $6 million late last year.
The bank has immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
"We are confident that the trader acted alone and that the matter has been resolved", Credit Suisse said.
The Supreme Court upheld Obama 's health care law .
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama's landmark health care law is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
In a 5-4 vote, the judges ruled that individual provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requiring citizens to purchase health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine are constitutional in accordance with the government's taxing authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts joined the four more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy opposed.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of that 2,700 page law and further ruled that the health care law's requirement that states increase Medicaid compliance or lose all federal funding for Medicaid is not unconstitutionally binding.
The lawsuit to block the bill was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was strongly opposed by every major Republican presidential candidate during the 2012 primary election season, including would-be presidential candidate Mitt Romney.
Football is the cause of the feud?
In the State Duma, politicians and experts spoke about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was to ban football in the North Caucasus, because it would cause scandal and strife.
Speaker Sergey Naryshkin recalled the recent events in Biryulyev and said that politicians and media should be correct in their statements to reduce "the degree of tension in society".
He was probably referring to the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of his TV shows threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire if they didn't try to limit the birth rate...
All speakers spoke about measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and about measures to harmonize relations between the peoples living in Russia, which gave the discussion a turbulence.
Maxim Grigoryev said the events in Biryulyev were "a model conflict that could be predicted", but "we have too many people and instances to answer for these questions", and seven nannies have a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism that Europe has long practiced towards migrants, according to the publicist, has failed and we need to find our own way.
The historian Yuri Petrov has great hopes for a new unified history textbook.
"We still need to create a textbook on the history of the culture of the peoples of the country, so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan, and vice versa", he said.
Zyuganov proposed to impose criminal liability for "calling for the dismemberment of Russia": "If you say on the radio in the United States that you should give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky was very careful not to "ignite".
As usual, he blamed journalists for bringing sick and acute national issues to public discussion: "In the heat of controversy, there is little to say!"
The leader of the United Russia faction, Vladimir Vasiliev, advised journalists to sign a "chart" and agree to conduct conversations on this topic carefully, and then politicians can take on the same obligations.
We have about 30 laws that regulate migration, and order is generally in place, Mr. Vasiliev said.
He cited as an example a law that places responsibility for ethnic peace on regional and municipal authorities.
But Lyudmila Andrichenko was not thrilled with the law: it lacks "clear ideas about what migrants' adaptation is, its mechanisms and limits.
So the subjects will interpret the scope of these powers differently.
And the municipalities don't have the resources to solve these complex issues, and the center doesn't give them the methodological guidance they could use.
The head of the Duma Committee on Nationalities, Hajimet Safaraliyev, proposed the creation of a special department with the formidable name of the "Ministry of National Security", which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 90s headed a similar department, which was later abolished, opposed.
It's enough to have a special federal person, a "minister without portfolio", to whom you can turn if you need to.
"We are walking along the edge, shells are ripping apart, it is very important for representatives of different ethnicities and religions to stand together against provocations, and this work must receive decent information support", said the representative of the ROC for public relations Vsevolod Chaplin.
No state neutrality regarding dangerous ideologies, including religious ones, should be, in his opinion, there should be.
Oleg Nilov took the discussion in an unexpected direction: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan still need to be sought, but they are being pushed down the wrong path, the wrong path", he said.
"The wrong way" is the development of football: "Footballers are beaten by the crowd, flags are burned, comrades throw stones at each other...
Maybe we don't need this kind of football.
There's another sport called rugby.
"There is no one like them in the world in this sport!" the wise man said.
Nobody will play rugby in the Caucasus! - Mr. Zhirinovsky immediately intervened.
You're gonna give them curling!
You have to know the national characteristics, it's like offering a Georgian Zaporozhets"...
In Yaroslavl, representatives of the Moscow club were wildly behaved on the stands - during a game with a local club.
Football would have to be banned nationwide...
The head of the Russian Federation's disciplinary committee, Artur Grigoryants, said that "Kuban" was fined 500 thousand rubles, reports the correspondent of the Football House "SE" Filip PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club were applied for the burning of the flag of Dagestan by fans on the stand during the home match of the 14th round against "Anji".
There were representatives from both clubs, a person from the RFPL.
We've examined all the available material.
For the wrongful behavior of the audience, "Kuban" was fined 500 thousand rubles.
Google, Samsung, Huawei are being sued by Nortel.
The group, which owns thousands of Nortel's former patents, filed a series of patent lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone makers, including Google, whose price it has been bidding on at the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel's patents for $4.5 billion, filed patent infringement lawsuits in the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technology that helps match keywords searched on the Internet to the corresponding ads, the lawsuit says, which is the foundation of Google's search business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable for comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones running on Google's Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered Nortel a $900 million initial price for the patents.
Google raised the asking price several times, eventually offering as much as $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patent case to Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, with the Motorola patent library being a key factor in the deal.
"Despite a failed attempt to auction off the patent claims, Google has violated and continues to violate them", the lawsuit says.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google as it alleges that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the lawsuit.
Egypt 's first freely elected president takes oath
Mohamed Morsi is sworn in, but the day of his inauguration is unlikely to mark the end of Egypt's political struggle.
ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted 16 months earlier.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He was sworn in before 18 black-robed judges in a courthouse on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic", Morsi said during a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life of absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability", said Morsi, a 60-year-old American-educated engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that for most of its 84 years has been a banned organization targeted by successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police when Morsi arrived with a small motorcade shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to welcome the new president, and unlike the presidential pomp of Mubarak's time, the traffic was only halted briefly to pass his motorcade on the usually busy road connecting the city center to the southern suburbs.
Although Morsi has been derided as an uncharismatic "spare wheel" of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has grown dramatically since his victory and Friday's speech in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamists but for all those who want to bring to an end the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state", Morsi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, told the judges in a wooden-panelled courtroom where he took the oath.
Morsi later went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural address.
He was given an official reception with the army orchestra performing the state anthem, during which he stood on the stand smirno.
Military leader Field Marshal Hussain Tantawi was present.
His arrival was greeted by the slogan  Army and people  one hand, which was chanted by hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a stronghold of secular education, Cairo University became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and promised to restore the president's powers, which were stripped from him by a military council that took over the cases of the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take the oath of office before the court, rather than before parliament, as is customary, he is doing the will of the military, and that is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
The next meeting of the Association of Machine Builders of the Tyumen region took place at the Yalutorov automobile plant.
The event included a presentation of a new line for the production of electric welding pipes made of steel.
As the commercial director of the enterprise Denis Gribanov told, in 2011, with the appearance of a new owner, a marketing study was conducted to study the market for the sale of steel structures in the Tyumen region.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electric welding pipes per month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile of the plant and install equipment for their production.
This year, more than 7 thousand tons of the products have been shipped.
Investments in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles, - said Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new machine was launched, which allows us to increase the range.
The plant produces both small profile pipes, which are used for the private household, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and large - for the construction industry.
We plan to produce 50,000 tons of products a year, which will be about 10 percent of the total consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the change of activity, the number of employees at the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157 people, the plans for the purchase of new equipment - an increase of staff by more than 50 employees.
The company is in the process of retraining staff and selecting the necessary specialists from the existing ones.
Next year, it is planned to introduce a new steel-cutting unit with a thickness of up to five millimeters, which will reduce the cost of production, as well as another machine with a production speed of up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company will begin producing pipes used in housing and communal services.
The company's management has set a goal to cover up to 70 percent of the needs of the Tyumen region for this product.
Deputy director of the investment policy department Leonid Ostrumov, addressing the heads of the production, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
This is also the case with government support for industry, which includes reimbursement of interest rates on loans for new equipment and leasing costs.
This year, 150 million rubles are planned for this purpose, two thirds of which have already been spent.
The last commission to review the subsidy contracts will receive the documents from the enterprises by November 15.
In addition, the budget covers the costs of local producers' participation in international fairs.
The budget for the next year provides 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate for lease payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
Five million will be allocated to participating in the fairs, three million to energy saving programs.
The funds for the replacement of the ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of the Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex, are reduced to 72 million rubles.
According to Leonid Ostrumov, in the future this form of support will cease, as the motive for its introduction was compensation for the tax on mining, which oil companies paid to the regional budget.
Currently they do not and subsidies become direct spending obligations of the region.
In view of this, the regional government considers it a priority to directly support industrial enterprises, rather than financing the oil industry through them.
The budgetary support will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many enterprise managers expressed concern about the situation with oilmen.
The subsidy for the equipment they purchase is a competitive advantage for the southern industry of the Tyumen region, and if it is canceled, it will be difficult to compete on price with the middle band of Russia, where the labor force is cheaper.
In addition, the question of the continuity of the new owner of TNK-VR - Rosneft, which does not yet place its orders at Tyumen enterprises, is unclear.
The agreement to implement the Uvatsky project expires in 2013, and no applications for its extension have been received.
Currently, the companies in the south of the region, which specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, are unable to form a portfolio of orders for the next year.
The question remains whether taxes on oil produced in the Uvat district will be paid to the regional budget or will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.
Tomic gets 240 hours for a social media video
The Leninsky district court in Tomsk has sentenced a resident of the city who posted an extremist video on a social network to 240 hours of forced labor, a spokesman for the regional court said on Friday.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted a video on his page in a popular social network, which was included in the federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case was opened against him under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity, as well as humiliating human dignity committed publicly".
"The Lenin district court considered the case in a special manner and found the man guilty of the above crime, imposing a sentence of 240 hours of forced labor", the agency's source said.
She added that the man had fully admitted his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians a drop in prices after signing the association with the European Union
Ukrainian Prime Minister Nikolai Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will fall significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said this during a conversation with readers of his Facebook page.
I can say with certainty that prices are determined by a number of factors, including customs duties.
So, once the agreement is signed and the Free Trade Area comes into force, the level of customs duties on EU imports will be significantly reduced.
And that would mean that prices would have to come down.
"This is about goods that come from EU countries", Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the effect of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
But still, there shouldn't be a price increase there either.
Therefore, the messages on the billboards, which have recently appeared quite a lot in our country, that the association with the EU is a price increase, is not quite so, or to be more precise - not at all", Azarov summed up.
Investigators are checking the child abuse in Biysk
On October 29, the media published a report that a kindergarten teacher in Biysk had locked the child in the basement for educational purposes.
Investigators are currently investigating the circumstances and giving a legal assessment to the activities of the kindergarten staff.
After being accused of drunkenness , Eugenie Vasilieva spoke up
Evgenia Vasilieva, who has been the focus of media attention for almost a year, has not commented on numerous publications in the press about the thefts in the Defense Ministry or about her personal relationship with former Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and her fondness for valuable things.
However, on November 1, the defendant in the case of "Oboronservis" broke her silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilyeva stated: "Initially, of course, the task was exactly one: to get any negative information out of me about the former defense minister".
There was blackmail about me having to testify or go to jail.
Today, those threats have stopped.
Next we go to court, we prove our innocence.
We are 100% sure of winning.
At the same time, from the interview, we can conclude that perhaps the most hurt Vasilieva was the words that she had no taste.
Probably, the statement of the official representative of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir Markin that the collection of paintings collected by the defence minister was found to be fake.
Among the seized property are a number of paintings that the owner, being confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the artistic examination appointed by the investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they have no artistic value and, simply speaking, are cheap forgeries", Markin noted in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defense...
They admitted they weren't stolen from the Defense Department, but they said I had bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss my personal details?
I think it's just a mess", says Vasilyeva.
Asked if she would admit to any of the 12 criminal incidents she is accused of, Vasilieva said: "Naturally, no.
There's nothing to confess.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation in question.
They're just misleading the public, that's all.
In addition, in response to the statement of the Russian Supreme Court that Vasiliev is avoiding studying the materials of the criminal case, the lawyer of the defendant stated that he and his client "the investigator does not allow to get acquainted with the materials of the case".
What led to the revelations of Vasilyeva, who is under house arrest and has not spoken to the press yet?
Perhaps as a woman she couldn't help but respond to an accusation of bad taste?
Or are the Komsomolky journalists right who claimed a few days ago that she "fell into an even greater trance under house arrest" because of news of Anatoly Serdyukov's reconciliation with his wife and his return to the family?
The famous military commentator of the "KP" Viktor Baranets in his article "Did Serdyukov return to his wife?" wrote: "Investigators do not exclude that after such a shock she may become more talkative during interrogations".
Earlier, Vasilieva was charged with illegal sale of real estate of the Ministry of Defense.
It's the winter troubles.
What to do in the garden before frost
In the autumn, it is better to use copper-containing fungicides, such as 1% Bordeaux or Abinga-Pic, Oxichem, Ordan, etc.
You think travel agents are a thing of the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be on the opposite path.
The company has updated its full-year profit forecast and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The tourism firm now expects its primary full-year pre-tax profit to be between $325 and $340 million, compared with a previous forecast in the range of $305 to $315 million.
If current benchmarks are met, this would represent a 1217 percent increase from the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/2012.
Managing Director Graham Turner said Flight Centre had made an 8 percent profit in the first half and started the second half with good results, especially on weekly trips to Australia and the UK.
"We have been operating profitably in our 10 countries since the beginning of the year, and some of them are expected to generate record profits before interest and taxes for the full year", he said.
This includes Australia and the UK, which are usually the biggest contributors.
In Australia, leisure business recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a somewhat weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, the Flight Centre leisure business was doing well, while corporate customers were spending less.
Its U.S. business has recouped losses incurred during the seasonally weak first half of the year and is expected to turn a profit for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, Flight Centre stock was up 3 cents to $38.20.
On October 31st, Barnaul police found two gambling halls.
The first one worked in the Industrial District on Vzletna Street.
At the time of the check-in, the establishment was playing a game.
There were 24 vending machines in the club.
Another gambling club was found in the Leninsky district on Anton Petrov street.
There were 20 slot machines in use.
The Russian Interior Ministry in Barnaul reports that administrative materials have been compiled under the article "Illegal organization and conduct of gambling".
The equipment was confiscated.
In the near future, the materials will be sent to the courts of the Industrial and Lenin district of the city.
In Ekaterinburg , a man killed two sisters and burned their bodies .
In Ekaterinburg, police are searching for a man who brutally murdered two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
As reported to "New Region" in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Sverdlovsk region, the day before in the afternoon in the Kirov district of the Ural capital after extinguishing a fire in a three-room apartment located in a residential house on the street of Uralskaya, two women's bodies with signs of violent death were found.
The identities of the dead were soon established.
It turned out that they were sisters, one of them - a 44-year-old resident of Ekaterinburg, the other - a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg region.
They rented the burned-out apartment a few days ago.
The investigation was taken under personal control by the chief police officer of the region, Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs authorities are working out various versions of the murder, checking the alibis of previously convicted citizens and those inclined to such acts.
It also establishes the purpose for which the women rented the apartment, where they lived before, what they did, who they had relationships with.
Schools urged more emphasis on math, spelling and grammar
School English courses will require students to study at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction since 1914.
The exam will also feature extracurricular texts to encourage wider reading.
The combined English language and literature course will be canceled.
From 2015, students will be required to take a separate language final exam, with strong recommendations for English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education is due to release new curricula in English and math tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul.
He'll be making changes to other major subjects next year.
The separate exam regulator OFQUAL will present a revised structure of the high school final exams, with a new grading system and less coursework.
Speaking in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said there was "a broad consensus that we need to reform our exam system to restore public trust", insisting that school leaving exams would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than most countries.
In comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours of instruction per year, while Singaporean schools provide about 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to spend more time on maths, sources in the coalition said that large-scale school-wide maths exams coupled with higher scores in the ranking table would likely provide an incentive for schools to provide additional math instruction.
The curriculum will focus more on "real-life tasks", including financial mathematics.
Tickets to Heihe will cost 2 200 rubles
From tomorrow, tourists will be transported from Blagoveshchensk to Heihe on airbags.
For those who want to go to China, it means extra expenses.
A cougar ticket is traditionally much more expensive than a boat.
As reported in the information service of the company "AmurASSO", the cost of a regular ticket will be 2 200 rubles.
The cost of the pass through the high-confort hall is 2,800 rubles.
By the way, this season tickets have not gone up: the same price pumas carried tourists last spring, and a year ago - in the fall.
Dmitry Medvedev: GDP growth rates are not enough for the country 's development
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that the GDP growth rate is not enough for Russia and believes that the situation can be improved by simplifying the conditions of business lending and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, reports Reuters.
We were planning for GDP growth of around 3 percent this year, maybe even a little bit more.
It's actually going to be a little less than 2%.
In the context of recession in a number of European countries, it seems not too bad, but for us it is not enough, because the economic base is not as strong as in a number of countries, and in general, in order to develop, there must be a higher rate.
Now it is very important that Russian companies, Russian business get normal loans at normal prices - this is the first thing that must be done", the head of government stressed.
Pamela Anderson cuts off her iconic light curls and shows off her radically new short hairstyle for the first time.
Pam's bright curls became famous for her role in the erotic TV series Saviors of Malibu.
Pamela Anderson is the latest celebrity to shock fans with a radically new hairstyle.
The little girl from the Malibu Saviors preferred a short platinum haircut to her long blonde hair.
The 46-year-old actress showed off her latest image while walking around Los Angeles on Wednesday, and also shared a photo on her Twitter page.
This beautiful blonde has her hair cut short for the first time in 20 years, and we love the modest change.

Security has evacuated staff and passengers from terminals two and three.
According to preliminary reports, the man was firing a high-powered rifle.

He's easily wounded.
Free medical care through mud, rivers and jungle
Dr. Georges Bvelle provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bev and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients.
In this West African country, there are not many doctors  only one for every 5,000 people.

Dr. George Bewley is one of CNN's top 10 heroes for 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main characters to become CNN Hero of the Year.
This man will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, George Bewley watched his father come back to life and fall unconscious again, wandering around hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bvelle was injured in a car crash in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but the infection spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that would haunt him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon", said Georges Bvlle.
If we had the money, we'd get him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bewle spent years accompanying his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving whatever treatment they could get.
"It's not easy", said Bewley.
You can leave your house at 5 a.m., run to the hospital to be first, but you're not first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people can die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Father Bewle died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
For comparison, in the United States, there is one doctor for every 413 people.
And even if Cameroonians could get a doctor, many of them would not be able to afford one.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of health care spending in this country is private.
"Their only problem is poverty", said Bewley.
And because of their poverty, they can't enjoy their life.
Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Bewley was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. George Bewley and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Yaoundé Central Hospital.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others load up vans, strap medical supplies to rooftops, and drive through the rough terrain to visit villages in need.
They don't always have good luck.
They had to push cars through rivers and mud more than once.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as real heroes: a celebration of song and dance and the best facilities the locals have to offer.
Free healthcare in these villages is truly a cause for celebration, and Bevelle, with his broad smile and boundless energy, is more than happy to join the fun.
The next morning, the team starts seeing hundreds of patients.
"We take 500 people on each trip", Bewley said.
They come from all over the county within a 60-kilometer radius of the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crayons, donated glasses, or free birth certificates - documents needed for schooling that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
The surgery is usually performed in a school, municipality or home; after the procedure, patients get up and walk to the postoperative area to make room for the next person.
Using a generator to illuminate the surgical and sanitary equipment, Bewle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
It's a crazy pace, but the team's determination is usually helped along by the village musicians.
"They're beating drums all night to keep us awake and working", said Bewley.
On Sunday, the crew headed back to town, tired but proud of their work.
This group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and international medical students, performed 700 free operations last year, and they know that their help can be of immense value to those they help.
One man explained that a free hernia operation would allow him to return to work.
"It will change the future for me and my family", the man said.
In addition to these clinical appointments on weekends and working in the hospital, the surgeon Bvelle also works at night in private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he says, that provides 60 percent of the funding for his nonprofit organization; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping", said Kathy O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in the Beetle group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so we can continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses like O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe to join Bewell in his mission, it's an opportunity to practice that they would never have had back home.
"We've had the opportunity to assist in surgeries where we've helped remove blood stains or hold tools for Dr. Bewley", O'Malley said.
As a sophomore, you would never have had that opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often with donated medicines.
But once in Yaoundé, Bvlle pays for their food, transportation and training.
"He's a hero, no doubt about it", said O'Malley.
He's given his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bewle, the almost constant workload is not a difficult challenge.
Helping others live happy lives, fulfilling a promise to his father, that's what brings him the greatest joy.
"I'm so happy doing this job", he told Bewley.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.

Snowden has agreed to testify about the wiretap of Merkel .
Bundestag member Hans-Christian Schrebele has met with Edward Snowden in Moscow.
The conversation focused on whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the German prosecutor general's office in a case involving a possible wiretap of the German chancellor's phone by U.S. intelligence.
Snowden has expressed his willingness to testify.
The meeting could have taken place in Moscow or Germany.
He made it clear, said Hans-Christian Strebele, that he knew a great deal.
And even though the NSA, led by Keith Alexander, has blocked his travel, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
But first, we must clearly define the conditions of his arrival.
Meanwhile, American lawmakers are taking action in response to the scandal surrounding U.S. spy programs.
The Senate Intelligence Committee approved a bill yesterday that places additional restrictions on the activities of the U.S. Department of Electronic Intelligence.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all spheres and areas.
This was stated by Belarus' Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei at a press conference after his meeting with Turkey's Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu, the correspondent of the BELTA reports.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all spheres and areas.
Belarus is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the state authorities of the two countries will provide all-round assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts", - said Vladimir Makei.
He stressed that the Belarusian government will create all necessary conditions and provide maximum assistance.
The minister also said that the 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish joint intergovernmental economic commission was held in Ankara, and a protocol was signed.
The sides developed a roadmap of Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy department, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade and investment, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, as well as seeking new forms and directions of cooperation.
"The protocol of the last meeting was fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey consider each other as reliable partners", he said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu, in turn, said that the heads of the foreign ministries of the two countries decided to continue developing mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
Trade turnover between Belarus and Turkey, according to the minister, should be increased and brought to $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in the field of investment cooperation, which needs to be developed further, as there is untapped potential in this area, he said.
Our countries have always had very warm relations, and we hope that they will continue to grow and expand.
All necessary conditions will also be created for trade and economic relations and for the successful work of Turkish companies in Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey", - said Ahmet Davutoğlu.
Obama backs out of his health care promises
Amidst a storm of criticism, President Obama yesterday backtracked on his oft-repeated, unequivocal promise that "if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it".
With hundreds of thousands of people receiving notice of service outages from their service providers, Republicans in recent days have criticized the president for misleading the American public.
Yesterday, Obama slightly tweaked his original public promise.
"Most people with health insurance that works can keep it", he said in a speech in Boston.
In what he called a "news flash" about the shutdown, Obama urged Americans who received the notifications to look for other options in the marketplace.
Most people will be able to get better, more comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than predicted.
"You'll get better terms", he said.
The administration said it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of people who buy insurance themselves may be forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me say this to these Americans: You deserve better", Sibelius said in a speech to the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online sales platform has been "terribly bad" since October.
"I'm as upset and angry as anyone", she said.
I really want to earn your trust back.
An irritated Sibelius dropped the phrase, which was picked up by a microphone behind her assistant at a House hearing yesterday after a heated debate with House Representative Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, about whether she should join Obama's health care program herself.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long again urged Sibelius to say why the architect of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily forgo government-sponsored insurance to purchase the plan through HealthCare.gov that she now imposes on millions of Americans.
Rosbalth Agency was stripped of its media status for obscene language.
On October 31, the Moscow City Court ruled that the Rosbalt registration license was invalid, - writes "Lenta".
The agency was stripped of its media status by Roskomnadzor for systematic and gross violations of the law on media.
The trial created an unpleasant precedent: the court considered it possible to close the media, effectively denying the publication the right to present counter-arguments.
What is Rosbalth?
Rosbalt Information Agency was founded in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional divisions.
The agency also has representative offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalth has been developing and functioning as a federal information and analytical agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was among the most recognizable private Internet media in Russia.
At the same time, "Rosbalt" has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency's exclusive publications were (and still are) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement.
Talks about the publication's closeness to law enforcement continued throughout the agency's existence.
Along with the fact that "Rosbalt" had a wide base of sources in various departments, the fact that Natalya Chaplin - wife of Viktor Cherkesov - was at the head of the project also spoke in favor of such assumptions.
At the same time, Chaplina's role in the leadership of Rosbalth is not clear: she is often called the "project manager".
The agency's general director is Larisa Afonina, the chief editor is Nikolay Ulyanov.
Recently, "Rosbalt" has not been ranked in the federal media - neither in terms of citations nor audience.
In October, the agency ranked 25th in the rating of visits to Russian media sites according to LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the website rosbalt.ru is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the last five months are notes about the Kremlin's helplessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of the soloist of the group "King and Joke", pogroms in the capital Biryulov.
The conflict between Roskomnadzor and Rosbalta began in July 2013, when amendments to the law on media came into force, banning journalists from using obscene language.
The agency found prohibited language in two videos published on the agency's website ("Jigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot desecrated oil towers").
The other side is described differently.
Roskomnadzor, based on the video footage, accused Rosbalt of gross and systematic violations of the law on media and filed a lawsuit to withdraw the agency's license.
Rosbalta claimed that the claims of the agency were unlawful: first, the videos were not editorial material, second, the mother words were masked, and, third, immediately after the warning, the videos were removed from the site.
The agency appealed Roskomnadzor's claims to the world court - and when the Moscow City Court accepted Roskomnadzor's claim on October 22, 2013, the proceedings were still ongoing.
However, on the 25th, the world judge made a decision not in favor of "Rosbalt": the chief editor Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the code on administrative violations and fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each video.
Apparently, that's what set the tone for the Moss City Court hearing - if you dismiss the idea that the outcome could have been set earlier.
On October 31, the court ruled that the Rosbalth registration certificate was invalid, effectively stripping the agency of its media status.
It is not to be said that Rosbalth was alone in this confrontation.
The agency was supported by the deputies of the State Duma (the application to the head of the Russian Commision for Supervision Alexander Zharov on October 10 was signed by 26 deputies; the document itself was submitted on the initiative of the Communist Party of Russia).
The head of the Russian Union of Journalists, Vsevolod Bogdanov, the chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists, Pavel Gusev, and the head of the Presidential Council for Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, said the publication was illegal to close.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the Roskomnadzor administration even gave him some guarantees that the license would not be revoked.
The Rosbalth trial has shown that the question of which jurisdiction is safer for mass media in Russia today is a big one.
Syria has destroyed chemical weapons equipment .
Syria has destroyed all of its declared chemical weapons production facilities, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has acknowledged.
This first phase of disarmament was completed a day ahead of schedule.
Syria was to destroy all production facilities and other facilities used to prepare the wartime poisoning materials by November 1, the BBC reports.
The destruction of the stocks of toxic substances or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the OPCW representative, the toxic substances are currently in sealed storage facilities.
International inspectors have been sent to Syria after a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21 killed, according to the US, more than 1,400 people.
The main task of the inspectors was to make sure that the Syrian authorities did not waste time in producing more chemical weapons and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These production facilities will now be closely monitored to prevent them from being repaired.
The next milestone is mid-November, when the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan to destroy the existing stockpiles of toxic substances.
There are a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who's going to provide the equipment?
All Syrian statements will be carefully vetted by Western intelligence.
They are willing to recommend new sites for inspection if there is reason to suspect that Damascus is not being completely forthright.
The U.S. believes this was a regular strike.
Syria and Russia insist that the Syrian rebels are behind it.
The international community demanded that the Syrian leadership - in accordance with an agreement reached through Russia's mediation - destroy or disable all facilities for producing shells containing poison gases and liquids and for filling shells with these substances.
Now that this stage has been passed, the next step should be to destroy the chemical weapons already in the Syrian army.
It is estimated that the arsenal may contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve agents, skin-to-skin mustard gas, and other banned chemicals, stored in dozens of different locations.
To destroy it, the OPCW and the Syrian authorities must first agree on a timetable - two weeks.
OPCW field operations chief Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors "personally oversaw the destruction of the equipment".
"They now have no ability to continue producing or mixing chemical weapons", he said.
The OPCW statement said inspectors visited 21 of 23 sites in Syria and verified that the facilities for producing the shells and poisons were either destroyed or rendered unusable.
The remaining two sites are too dangerous to inspect, the document said, but the equipment was moved and inspected by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the chemical weapons infrastructure was "particularly difficult" because of the ongoing conflict.
The OPCW won the Nobel Peace Prize in early October, but according to Smith, the inspectors had no time to celebrate - they were too busy.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented admission that U.S. espionage has gone too far.
John Kerry demonstrated a softening of the defense of U.S. surveillance programs by making an unprecedented admission that in some cases U.S. espionage "has gone too far".
The Secretary of State also admitted to being guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being on autopilot during the high-profile revelations of Edward Snowden's NSA spying.
These leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic row with its allies.
Speaking via video link at an open government conference in London, Mr Kerry said: "There is no doubt that the president and I, and other members of the government, were actually on autopilot, because this was the case during World War II, and during the very difficult years of the Cold War, and of course on September 11".
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had gone too far, but stressed that no one's rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it's gone too far.
And the president is determined to shine a light on this and to explain it to people, and he's doing a thorough analysis right now to make sure that no one has any sense of abuse.
I assure you, there are no abuses against innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was acting with good intentions and that his surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We are working in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, blow people up and attack governments.
What if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented plane crashes, building explosions, and people from getting killed because we could know about these plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will head to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged U.S. espionage abroad and to convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counterterrorism efforts with the United States, the chairman of the Senate European Affairs subcommittee said Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations because of frustration with the surveillance conducted by the National Security Agency.
"It is really important for the national security interests of the United States that the Europeans remain our backers in our joint counterterrorism efforts", said Democrat Murphy, serving his first term and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
And I'm going to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programs.
News that the NSA had collected millions of phone records in Europe has soured relations with some US allies, although the agency's head said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies were collecting and sharing with the US.
Other revelations included documents leaked by Snowden showing that the NSA monitored the mobile phones of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended espionage against the Allies as necessary and said it was common practice on both sides.
Amid the buzz, Murphy said his office was organizing a trip of members of Congress that was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both houses.
The names of the other lawmakers involved are expected to be announced in the coming days.
He said the trip program is still in the works.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the trip was to promote better relations, he said that some degree of "hardness from the best of intentions" would also be shown.
He said European leaders should be honest with their people about what spyware they themselves have used for years.
While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones doing intelligence, Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is due to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address the hostility to U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, and U.S. intelligence.
New public observation commissions will increase prison guards ' influence
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve the new compositions of the Public Observation Commissions (OPC) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the vote goes through, the security lobby will have more influence.
The OCC is a public body that monitors conditions in prisons.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozzhaev, the unrest in the Kopean colony - it is through the ONK that most of the resonant incidents behind bars are publicized.
The fight for control of the ONK is between human rights activists and law enforcement lobbyists.
At the meeting of the OP working group on the formation of the NCOs, I proposed that human rights experience be used as a selection criterion.
"It was not accepted, and lists were formed without criteria", says Valery Borchev.
Borchev is the current chairman of the Moscow Observation Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, a Russian-wide body of human rights defenders involved in prison problems.
While a state Duma deputy from "Yablok" he developed a law regulating the activities of the ONK.
The OP Council must vote on the composition of the NCs in the 43 regions of the country.
Fewer than a thousand candidates are applying for 1,800 vacancies, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria, the competitions could not be organized due to the lack of candidates.
The O.P. promises to fill the vacancies.
Moscow's NSC is one of the few commissions with a competition, despite the fact that the new composition will have 40 participants instead of 20.
According to Borchev, the current composition of the capital commission consists of 11 human rights defenders and 9 security forces, and in the version that is on the ballot in the OP, the ratio changes to 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to get into the capital commission.
But the new composition may be reintroduced by the representative of the "Battle Brotherhood" Vyacheslav Kalinin.
He was a member of the ONK for three years, but he never visited the prisoners.
Borchev believes that the security forces, appointing their chairman of the ONK, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so the human rights defenders do not exclude a collective exit from the commission.
According to them, the advance of the security forces is coordinated by the member of the ONK Anton Tsvetkov, who heads the "Officers of Russia" - an organization that defends the interests of the security agencies.
"I don't eat babies on the train", Anton Tsvetkov told RBC daily.
He denies lobbying for any lists and says he is not going to prevent human rights activists from visiting arrested opposition figures.
According to Tsvetkov, he didn't even ask what list the OP is voting for.
He considers the Borchets' release of information a form of pressure.
The possible success of the human rights defenders is the planned change of the leadership of the Chelyabinsk National Committee.
Its former executives are being fired because of last year's cope riots.
The Public Chamber concluded that the local commission had ignored the prisoners' concerns.
But the NSC of Rostov-on-Don could move from human rights activists to security forces.
The new lists "missed" the human rights defender-chairman of the local commission, but one of his opponents was, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber expelled him for unethical behavior.
The lists of the Moscow and Rostov commissions are considered by Borchev to be "revenge for Kopeysk".
The revelations of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova did not affect the ONK of Mordovia, which is considered "strong": only one human rights defender wanted to get into the new composition, and she was not even accepted for the competition.
OP council member Nikolai Svaniidze told RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list because he was upset by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He sent his position to the other members of the council.
His colleague on the OP Pavel Gusev says he voted for it because he likes the Moscow list.
The lists of the OPC were coordinated by the Deputy Secretary of the OP Vladislav Gриб, who is also a member of the Scientific Research Institute of the FSIN.
Hryb told RBC daily that he does not think it is right to divide candidates into human rights defenders and security forces and does not agree that the chairmen of the commissions have enough authority to hinder the work of its members.
The fungus is not about to predict the outcome of the OP board vote.
If the proposed list is rejected today, an amended version will be put to a vote in the coming days.
Australian woman appeals Thai prison sentence
A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island for falsely claiming she was attacked by a taxi driver appealed her sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty of filing a false claim by a Phuket provincial court on June 15 after Thai police reported that a local taxi driver had carried out the attack on the night of Sunday, June 10, while two other men were holding her.
However, surveillance footage later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after breaking off with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she admitted to fabricating the story.
She was held in local police cells until the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a general detention center on the outskirts of Phuket, not an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who has turned to the Foreign Office in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about their daughter's well-being and were waiting for her return to Australia.
"Obviously it was a troubled time, but we hope she gets home safely as soon as possible", Tanks said.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released on 50,000 baht bail.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently on holiday in the resort area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand said Bamford is currently representing a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that an appeal could see her sentence increased to two years and she could be sentenced to adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be seeking to rebuild its tarnished tourism image, leading to a acquittal.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris for the presentation of his novel "Yeltschevs", translated into French.
Recall that this novel was a finalist for four awards: "Yasnaya polyana", "Russian Booker", "National bestseller" and "Big book".
And last year, the writer was awarded the Russian Federation government's prize in culture for this book.
Roman Senchin is the undisputed leader of the generation of current thirty- and forty-year-old prose writers.
Almost every publication of his hard-hitting stories and novels, built on contemporary life material, has been hotly debated by critics of all stripes.
It can be argued that the collected articles on Senchin's prose and publicism, reviews of his books and magazine publications create an interesting and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
In discussions about the works of "one of the most controversial contemporary writers", according to critic Sergey Chuprinin, the discussion is largely about what its participants understand by the word "literature", as they see the present and future not only of our literature, but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow for the inclusion of most articles and reviews from regional media and the blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are usually given in abbreviated form in the "Abkhaz..." sections.
