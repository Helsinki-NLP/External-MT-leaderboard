Rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
Cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and in the UK, thus confirming that despite different stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to improve their preparedness for the influx of COVID-19 patients who will require treatment and, in particular, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were recorded in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a new type of coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was the causative agent of the infection.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to the available data to date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild disease, i.e. respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with most patients recovering.
Approximately 14% of COVID-19 cases develop into a more severe form requiring hospitalization, and the remaining 6% develop into a critical form requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
This study analyzes the trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence in each European Union (EU) /European Economic Area (EEA) country and in the UK and compares them with trends in the Chinese province of Hubei.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with data for Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK
After the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and currently in the rest of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing at the same pace as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Mr. Spiteri and colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met the criteria for WHO diagnosis.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were reported in France on 24 January 2020  all three cases returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the UK, with 39 768 cases and 1 727 deaths recorded between 31 December 2019 and that date, of which 17 750 cases, including 1 441 deaths, are in Italy alone.
Determination of cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates daily at 8:00 a.m. data on the number of COVID-19 cases in each country in the world, from official sources such as health ministries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse the trends in the spread of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with the data for Italy.
The COVID-19 cumulative incidence rate for 14 days was calculated as an indicator of the level of spread of active COVID-19 cases, taking into account the normal COVID-19 rate in each EU/EEA country and in the UK from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as of 8:00 a.m. on 15 March 2020, compared to data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK
The trends in the 14-day period of cut-off cumulative COVID-19 incidence in EU/EEA countries and the UK were generally consistent with the trends observed in China's Hubei Province (Figure 1).
Cumulative COVID-19 incidence in the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole began to rise around 21 February, and a sharp jump occurred on 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but similar trends in the cumulative increase in COVID-19 were also observed in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to the same figure for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to this data, the total number of cases already recorded as of 8:00am on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the UK is comparable to the number recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results indicate a rapid increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence suggest that the pandemic is evolving at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this is despite different stages in different countries, differences in response measures taken by national public health authorities, and perhaps different criteria for recognizing cases and different rules for selecting patients for COVID-19 testing, including "overlapping" testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that about 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions were already fully staffed.
Currently, data on admission of COVID-19 patients to hospitals and/or intensive care units in the EU/EEA are available only for 6 per cent and 1 per cent of cases respectively (data not provided).
However, systematic data collection is needed to complement current surveillance data on the number of reported cases and deaths.
According to a study carried out in 2010/2011, there is a significant spread in Europe between the number of beds in intensive care units and intensive care units: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care units and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010/2011).
The sixth updated ECDC report on the results of the COVID-19 Express Risk Assessment presents scenarios for modelling the burden of health systems with estimated COVID-19 hospitalization data in each EU/EEA country and in the UK, where the risk of a shortage of available beds in intensive care units is over 90%.
As cases are currently grouped by EU/EEA and UK regions and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve a specific territorial group, information on infection cases and bed numbers in intensive care units is recommended to be provided where possible by the units of level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units must be prepared for the long-term contact scenario of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the increasing number of COVID-19 patients requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, as can be seen in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the latest ECDC report on the results of the Express Risk Assessment, a rapid, preventive and integrated approach is essential to contain the spread of SARS-COV-2 with a subsequent shift from containment to mitigation, as with the projected rapid increase in the number of cases, decision makers and hospitals may simply not have enough time to devise, adopt and adapt their responses if such measures are not taken in advance.
The report on the results of the Express Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time in which they can step up their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, in the coming days or weeks, health systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an influx of patients requiring intensive care.
The outbreak of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a tragedy for humanity: more than 3,000 people have died in China and other countries around the world so far, and the number of infected has exceeded 80,000.
Like the homologous SARS-CoV virus that caused the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and has a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people more often than younger people and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid growth in the number of publications on a new disease, this article offers a timely and comprehensive review of a rapidly evolving field of research.
We will look at the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of this disease.
Although many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this review will help us to understand and eradicate this dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) that fell on January 25 in 2020 was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese, who were urged to stay home throughout the holiday and for many weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of the new virus infection.
Given its high degree of similarity to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the virus SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease  coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and quickly spread throughout the country and then to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been identified, with more than 40,000 patients recovering and more than 3,000 patients dying.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "the number one enemy of society" and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 publications have appeared on COVID-19, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020, which identified the virus sequence isolated from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to summarise the results of research in a new and rapidly developing subject area.
We will try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and another coronavirus-caused disease  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, which started in 2012.
We will also discuss what we know about disease prevention and prognosis, as well as some other issues that are no less pressing.
Coronavirus has traditionally been considered a pathogen that is not lethal to humans and is mainly responsible for approximately 15% of all respiratory illnesses 4.
However, we have twice experienced highly pathogenic human coronaviruses in this century, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused outbreaks initially in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively and soon spread to many other countries with alarming levels of disease severity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the report on clusters of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin was first received by the National Health Commission of China from Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death was reported in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, it became known that health workers had been infected, suggesting that the virus could be transmitted from person to person.
On January 23, a quarantine was imposed in Wuhan, and public transportation was suspended.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease found that 21 of the 41 confirmed coronavirus patients had direct contact with a seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point for the spread of the infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global public health emergency.
At the time of writing , the disease has spread throughout China and has now spread to about 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2).
Given the rapidly evolving situation, the final extent and degree of the outbreak's danger is yet to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-center clinical trial involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, provided the following updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
All age groups were found to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, but most people were aged 30 to 65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50, very few under 20, and only 14 were under 10.
The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 among men is higher (0.31/100 000) than among women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 has been spreading in clusters mainly in Hubei Province and nearby regions.
On average, 5 (29) days elapsed from the time of the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to the time of diagnosis.
The incubation period was 4.8 (3,07,2) days.
From the time of onset of symptoms to death, an average of 9.5 (4,813) days elapsed.
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95 % CI: 3.514.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.234.82.
By January 23, 2020, there was an exponential increase in the number of infections, coinciding with the massive transportation on the eve of Chinese New Year celebrations.
The mortality rate among patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95 percent CI: 1.101.86 percent), and the corrected mortality rate among patients was 3.06 percent (95 percent CI: 2.024.59 percent).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were: gender (male), age (≥60) and severe cases of pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large membrane viruses that contain a single strand of sensory RNA.
They can be divided into four types, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha and beta coronaviruses are known to infect humans.
In the case of SARS and MERS-type coronaviruses, the membrane spike glycoprotein (S) binds to the cell receptors of angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4) respectively, after which membrane synthesis occurs.
The genome of the viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA together with membrane glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins generates virion-containing vesicles, which then fuse with the cell membrane, releasing the virus.
The first reports on the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new type of beta-coronavirus, with a 99.98% gene matching 10 sequential samples collected at the first outbreak site, the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
With the help of luminescent electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-thin sections of human respiratory epithelium.
It has been established that the human enzyme ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human ACE2 enzyme less strongly than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients to have less severe disease than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate a previously unknown short-lived protein encoded orf3b and a secreted protein encoded orf8.
The SARS-CoV-2 protein orf3b may play some role in terms of virus pathogenicity and inhibition of IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, a team of authors led by Zhou presented reports on cryosolid tomography of the structure of the full-size human enzyme ACE2 with a resolution of 2.9 Å in combination with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S-proteins, which is evidence in recognizing and infecting the coronavirus.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target in drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate owner
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated in bats, from which the virus was transmitted to humans via the civet and camels respectively.
By phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was established that the first hosts of SARS-CoV-2 were bats, as the new virus is 96 percent identical to two SARS-like coronaviruses, namely the bat coronaviruses SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown which species became the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier and infect humans; the transmission route is also yet to be determined.
Mr. Ji and his colleagues suggested that the virus was transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, which then homologously recombined in the S-protein.
Chinese scientists from Guangzhou have suggested that pangolins, long-eared mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on 99 percent genetic similarity between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still very large, so it is considered that the final results with concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (fig. (fig. 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
In laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 4050% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet light and heating to 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75 percent ethyl alcohol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peroxide, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents can effectively block the virus's activity, but not chlorhexidine.
The human population as a whole is not immune to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, there are no data on detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, primarily SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. (fig. 4).4).
Usually, the host virus is first recognized by the innate immune system through image-recognition receptors (IRRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus causes inflammatory factors to be expressed, dendritic cells to mature, and type I interferons to be synthesized, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis against viral antigens.
However, due to the N-protein, SARS-CoV can avoid immune response.
Soon, an adaptive immune response is involved in the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Helper T cells produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protect cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit T-cell function, causing them to die by programmed cell death.
Humoral immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also play an important role in fighting viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an immune system overreaction causes a local buildup of large amounts of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst-case scenario, lead to polyorgan failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by cluster manifestations, is more likely to affect older people with co-morbidities and pregnant women.
The risk of infection is higher for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have a compromised immune system.
According to the results of the study of the first 425 cases of infection in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mainly 37 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days, with a range of 0 to 24 days.
A later study, based on the demographics of 8,866 cases, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.07.2) days.
It is important for health authorities to adjust the timing of quarantine measures to take into account the most accurate estimates of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus to those infected who have no symptoms.
A 14-day quarantine has become common practice for people who have been in contact with the virus or are infected with the virus.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often high fever, which may be the only symptom or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, colds, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients have had shortness of breath and/or hypoxia within a week of onset.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory illness, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with high fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever should be screened for the virus to make an early diagnosis even if no pathology is shown on the chest scans.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 revealed the following prevalence of symptoms: 98 percent fever, 76 percent dry cough, 55 percent shortness of breath and 3 percent diarrhea; 8 percent of patients required artificial ventilation of the lungs.
Similar results were obtained in two recent studies of family transmission and transmission from asymptomatic individuals.
Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in a study of patients with MERS-CoV, whose main symptoms were also high fever (98 percent), dry cough (47 percent) and shortness of breath (55 percent).
However, 80% of these required artificial ventilation of the lungs, a rate much higher than among COVID-19 patients, and it corresponds to a higher mortality rate from MERS than from COVID-19.
MERS patients also had diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) .
The main symptoms of SARS patients are high fever (99100 %), dry cough (2975 %), shortness of breath (4042 %), diarrhea (2025 %) and sore throat (1325 %), and artificial ventilation of the lungs is required by 1420 % of patients.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2%, and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
In comparison, SARS deaths in November 2002 were 10 percent of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic survey conducted in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
According to earlier research, the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined to be 6.47 at a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.717.23, whereas the R0 for SARS-CoV was only in the range of 2 to 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality rate and R0 is given in Table Table 1.1.
The above indicators indicate a higher spread capacity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but a lower mortality rate when infected with the new virus compared to the latter two.
Thus, containment of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will be much more difficult than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Cluster transmission often occurs when a family or group of people are together for a reason or are on a transportation, such as a cruise ship.
Patients had frequently traveled to Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there, or had contact with infected or ill people within the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, the data presented in the reports suggest that people can be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and that patients who are cured after discharge from the hospital may become carriers again, and this is a warning sign for extending the quarantine period.
In the early stages, patients have normal or decreased leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1 099 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with lymphopenia with leukocyte levels < 4×109/L, including leukocyte levels < 1×109/L, as well as elevated levels of asparagin-aminotransferase and viremia.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin, and most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and red blood cell deposition.
Patients with severe disease had elevated levels of D-dimer, a breakdown product of fibrin, in their blood, and their lymphocyte counts were constantly decreasing.
Most COVID-19 patients have had chest X-rays that show uneven dark circles on both sides or a matte glass-like dark circle in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory illness (ARD).
When OCD develops, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup, and progressive fibrosis lead to significant impairment of gas exchange.
Dysfunction of type I and II pneumocytes lowers the level of surface active compounds and increases surface tension, thus reducing the lung's ability to expand and increasing the risk of collapse.
Thus, the worst X-ray results often coincide with the most severe cases of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the separation of pneumocytes, formation of hyaline membranes and intertissue lymphocyte infiltration, and multicore syncytic cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease, corresponding to the pathology of viral infection and SARS and similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The main criteria for diagnosing COVID-19 was the method of detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (PCR with reverse transcriptase).
However, given the high level of false-negative results, which may accelerate the pace of the epidemic, since February 13, 2020, China has begun to make diagnoses based on clinical manifestations (no longer relying exclusively on PCR with reverse transcriptase).
It was a similar situation with the SARS diagnosis.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and X-ray results.
On 14 February 2020, a team of experts led by Feng Zhang described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK methodology to detect SARS-CoV-2; this methodology allows the detection of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at densities from 20 × 1018 mol/L to 200 × 1018 mol/L (10100 copies per microlitre of the original sample) using indicator strips in less than an hour without the use of complex equipment.
This new technique, if successfully tested on clinical drugs, could significantly improve the sensitivity and convenience of testing.
Due to the lack of experience in treating previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can generally provide COVID-19 patients with only supportive therapy, while also trying to apply any therapeutic methods that have been used or proposed in treating other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).2).
These therapeutic techniques include current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immune suppressors, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
It was even suggested that plasma from recovered patients be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are rushing to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs, and may also affect other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys, to a lesser extent.
However, respiratory failure and malfunction are the leading cause of death and death in patients.
Thus, respiratory support is critical to alleviate symptoms and save lives, including general oxygen therapy, high-concentration oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, which are prescribed depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified technique of extrapulmonary blood circulation used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining water-salt balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ function are of paramount importance for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that cytokine storm is a consequence of hyper-reaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammation that develops in response to the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause the immune cells to release a huge amount of free radicals, which are the main cause of ADD and polyorgan failure.
In the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in patients with severe conditions, suppression of the immune system is essential.
Corticosteroids and tocilisumab, monoclonal antibodies that act as interleukin-6 inhibitors, were used to treat cytokine storm.
Other treatments for cytokine storm based on immune suppression include modulating the immune response to control T cells; blocking the production of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF cytokines; suppressing janus kinase; using blinatumomab, cytokine signal suppressors 4 and histone acetalase inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used to reduce the severity of inflammatory effects in the treatment of SARS viruses as immune suppressants.
However, steroids in large doses are not useful in treating severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly worsen the prognosis.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium doses are recommended to be used with caution in the treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, there is no proven effective antiviral therapy.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, was found to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also demonstrated the ability to suppress other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on this data, Gilead provided this drug formulation to China for paired trials on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these trials are awaited with anticipation.
In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been proposed as possible treatment options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects.
Careful monitoring of interactions between these medicines and other medicines prescribed to patients should be undertaken.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody production
Blood has been collected from patients who have recovered from infectious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect a healthy population for a long time.
And in fact, the blood of recovered patients often has relatively high levels of antibodies to fight the pathogen.
Antibodies are in the immunoglobulin produced by B cells to fight pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogen molecules and target them.
Based on this assumption, plasma was isolated from blood samples from a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19, which was then injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, their inflammation and viral load decreased, and their blood oxygen saturation increased.
However, to suggest that this method be used before specific therapy, it requires untested and unspoken explanations.
In addition, some of the drawbacks of using plasma should be carefully considered in view of the therapeutic effect.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune system and cause cytokine release syndrome, which, given its toxicity, is potentially life-threatening.
Blood levels of antibodies are usually low, and plasma is needed to treat critically ill patients.
It's not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic.
So it's more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and determine the genetic code of the active antibodies or to screen to find active antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.
So we can immediately move on to mass production of antibodies.
The Chinese have used traditional medicine for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends largely on the combination of many components of the formula, which varies according to the diagnosis of the disease, based on theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have an uncertain effect, as it is difficult to identify and test these components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of an effective specific therapy for COVID-19, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest proportion of COVID-19 patients recovered was in a number of provinces in China, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat 87%, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest rate of recoveries (13%).
However, this is a rather rough comparison, since the assessment must be made taking into account a number of other influencing factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine alone with combined Western and Chinese medicine.
They found that the time to normalize body temperature, relieve symptoms, and provide medical care in a hospital setting was significantly shorter for patients who were treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than for patients who were treated with only Western methods.
Most surprisingly, the proportion of patients who started to have worsening symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the group treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in the group treated with Western methods alone (7.4% compared to 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8% compared to 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine still requires more closely controlled studies conducted on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also of particular interest to obtain a description of the mechanism of action and to explain the aspects of effectiveness of the components used in the methods of traditional Chinese medicine, or their combination.
Patients who are suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 are generally more likely to be very afraid of the acutely contagious and even fatal disease, and people who are quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness and extreme irritability.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even more anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric disorders were reported, including chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor agitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal behavior.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine as part of health authorities' efforts to contain the COVID-19 epidemic can increase people's anxiety and guilt about spreading the infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected and contacted persons, and all other people who require it.
As part of psychological support, multi-disciplinary psychiatric care teams should be formed, clear information should be provided with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and professional electronic devices and applications should be used to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in breaking the chain of transmission from infected animals and infected humans to susceptible hosts and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work has been conducted to develop S-protein-based vaccines, which aim to produce long-lived and highly active neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
In animal studies, live attenuated SARS vaccines have been developed.
However, before clinical trials can begin, it is still necessary to determine the efficacy of these potential vaccines in natural conditions when used in elderly patients, the pattern of infection with lethal doses and the degree of protection against infection with zoonotic viruses.
Perhaps the reason is that SARS disappeared 17 years ago, and no new cases have been reported since.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of MERS-related disease continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the preservation of zoonotic sources in endemic habitats.
Vaccination strategies using inactivated virus, DNA plasmid, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein elements have been developed to combat MERS, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for people with no immunity is an urgent and critical task that requires solutions to contain the raging epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long time (on average 18 months) required to develop a vaccine and the dynamic variation of coronaviruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only just beginning to show the full clinical picture of the disease in thousands of patients.
Most patients recover gradually without complications.
However, COVID-19, like SARS and MERS, is also associated with a high incidence of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease progression.
In this regard, it is critical for health authorities to build a disease prognostic model to prioritize their actions, especially in areas where there is a shortage of resources.
Based on the clinical trial data presented at this time, the following factors may influence or be associated with the prognosis of disease in patients with COVID-19 (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the course of the disease caused by SARS, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients aged 30 to 65 years, 47.7% of whom are over 50 years old, according to the aforementioned study of 8,866 cases.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying illnesses and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not require such therapy (average age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection rates among men are higher than among women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Incidence and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to develop acute myocardial injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiological events were also the leading cause of death among SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may cause liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and underlying disease are closely linked and can distort results.
Abnormalities detected in laboratory studies: the level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is proposed to consider it as a potential prognostic factor of the course of the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
It was also suggested to consider the relationship between C-reactive protein levels, disease severity and prognosis for COVID-19.
In addition, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase, asparagine aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and creatine kinase may also predict the outcome.
These enzymes are secreted in large quantities by various organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
So they're traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: In order to predict outcomes and complications in the treatment of COVID-19, along with other factors, chest X-ray data and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immune suppressants widely used in infectious diseases as an adjunctive therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Because corticosteroids were widely used to treat severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis, which led to lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if steroids are needed to treat COVID-19 patients, these drugs should be prescribed in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress as they often have to endure long quarantine periods, cope with high levels of uncertainty and witness the death of their relatives and other patients.
To relieve stress and help such patients return to normal life, counseling and long-term support are essential.
According to current demographic studies, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different in its features from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other common cold-causing coronaviruses, can successfully multiply in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms at all in the early stages of infection.
For this reason, patients who are in the early stages of the disease or have not yet completed the incubation period may, as they go about their normal lives, spread the virus on a large scale, which makes epidemiological control significantly more difficult.
However, it was thought that transmission of SARS-CoV virus occurs when patients are seriously ill, although most cases did not occur in the early stages of infection.
So today's COVID-19 epidemic is far more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it's harder to control.
Currently, China is undergoing a major work to declare a general quarantine in Wuhan and nearby cities, and extend the quarantine regime for virtually the entire population, which was introduced to break the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures are causing huge damage to the economy and other areas of the country's life, the number of new cases being detected is decreasing, which suggests that the spread of the epidemic is slowing down.
The most optimistic estimates are that the outbreak will end by March, and the cooling off phase will last 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter and colleagues estimated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which looks much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Researchers from a team led by Ira Longini have developed a model to predict the end of the epidemic and have suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two-thirds of the world's population.
A team of Canadian experts reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in nasal swabs taken from patients who had recovered and been discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical illness similar to influenza.
However, the decline in new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that current strategies may have had an effect.
Initial estimates put the Ebola virus at up to a million people and half a million deaths.
But with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally brought under control.
There is a possibility that, like SARS-CoV, the infectious capacity of SARS-CoV-2 may decline and over time it will disappear or evolve into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Fig. (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by high rate of transmission through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, which means that oral-fecal transmission is also possible.
According to one recent study, 41 percent of the 138 cases studied may have been the result of hospital infections, including 17 patients with other previously identified illnesses and 40 health care workers.
Therefore, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even strangers who come into contact with patients or infected.
The first line of defense in the fight to reduce the risk of infection  is wearing face masks; both surgical masks and N95 (series No. 1860s) respirators help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent micro-droplets of fluid from potentially infected people from flying into the air and settling on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 masks (series No. 1860s) can protect against inhalation of 10 to 80 nm variants, they only let through 5% of the variants; the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as the SARS-CoV, and they are both about 85 nm.
Because particles can pass through even five surgical masks folded together, healthcare workers who come into direct contact with patients should be required to wear N95 (series No. 1860s) masks, not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare workers should wear a protective gown to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a class N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare workers should also wear transparent face shields or closed-type goggles.
All people in affected or potentially vulnerable regions are strongly advised to wash their hands more often with disinfectant detergents, try to stay indoors, self-isolate, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
The acceptable distance to the patient is about a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the virus from spreading.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was previously unknown to mankind, its high degree of similarity to SARS-CoV, reported on 7 January 2020, should have been a wake-up call for China, given its experience during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was only after January 19, 2020, that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured the public that the new virus had low contagiousness and limited reproductive capacity when transmitted from person to person and that preventing and controlling the spread of the disease would not be a problem.
The announcement greatly reduced social tensions, especially as the entire country prepared for the Chinese New Year celebrations, and missed a critical time when the disease could be contained within Wuhan with minimal casualties.
China's health authorities can learn this hard lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) be more careful in making public statements, as every word is taken into account by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more vigilant in monitoring and responding to unusual information coming from clinics, rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more decisive measures to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages, rather than placate the public; and (4) conduct more targeted and effective exercises to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and regularly screen and improve the public response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by a previously unstudied severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus, began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease has spread throughout China and to 50 countries around the world as of this writing.
Because the virus is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) coronavirus and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a feeling of SARS recurrence.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are significant in terms of containment of the epidemic and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people, and men more than women; the rate of severe cases and mortality among older people is also higher than among younger people.
The mortality rate from SARS is higher than that of COVID-19 (10,91%, compared to 1,44%).
COVID-19 patients spread the virus even when they have no symptoms, whereas SARS patients usually only infect others in severe cases, so it is harder to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Some COVID-19 patients may have a negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA test.
On the other hand, cured patients may test positive for the virus again.
All of this significantly increases the risk of the virus spreading.
With the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, some critical questions remain unresolved, namely:
What is the origin of SARS-CoV-2?
Despite the 96 percent homology between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, we still cannot say that SARS-CoV-2 infection originated in bats.
What animal became the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from its original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot reliably stop transmission, and the epidemic situation could escalate at any time.
Molecular modeling and biochemical testing have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-producing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot provide a fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve in the process of human-to-human transmission?
Will it cause a global pandemic, will it disappear like SARS, or will it recur periodically like the flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
But we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life, no matter what it takes.
Zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the coevolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their carriers, including humans, for millennia.
Until 2003, two human coronavirus (HCoV) were known to cause mild illness, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our understanding of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus in central China in late 2019 brought renewed attention to coronaviruses and surprised us with its high transmissibility but less pronounced pathogenicity compared to its cousin SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonotic disease, and understanding its zoonotic origin will be very helpful.
Most human coronaviruses originate from bats, for which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoirs-carriers of some human coronaviruses are also known.
The identification of vector animals directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
Studying the interaction of animals that are carriers of coronaviruses can also shed light on the pathogenesis of coronaviruses in humans.
In this review, we present the available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on their history of discovery, as well as their zoonotic origin and interspecies transmission.
It's important to note that we're comparing and matching different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genome recombination.
The current epidemic of the disease caused by the coronavirus, discovered in 2019 (COVID-19), is also considered in this context.
The conditions necessary for successful carrier change and the impact of virus evolution on disease severity are also noted.
Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of membrane viruses with one positive-polar strand of RNA.
These viruses, with the largest genome of RNA viruses, containing between 26,000 and 32,000 nucleotides, are named for their shape, which when viewed under an electron microscope resembles a crown.
In terms of structure, coronaviruses contain unsegmented genomes with identical organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replication polyproteins.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, denoted nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains open reading frames for structured proteins, including spike protein (S), membrane protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
Other coronaviruses also encode a number of line-specific accessory proteins.
Based on differences in protein sequences, coronaviruses are divided into four types (alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-coronavirus), with the beta-coronavirus type including most human coronaviruses and divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha- and beta-coronavirus is bats and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma- and delta-coronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have continually overcome species barriers, and some have evolved into dangerous pathogens.
Seven human coronaviruses are known to date.
These include human alpha-coronavirus HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The remaining five betacoronavirus include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type two SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as a cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe infectious diseases of the lower respiratory tract in a relatively large number of patients with a higher risk of acute respiratory illness (ARD) and exocrine symptoms.
The first strand of the human coronavirus HCoV-229E, B814, was obtained from a sample taken from the nasal cavity of patients who had a cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has provided more detailed knowledge about HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses, which cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, before the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a commonly accepted concept that human coronavirus infection was generally considered harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history, infecting more than 8,000 people and causing an overall mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a long-term epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease sporadically spreading to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV) discovered in 2019, which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current 2019 coronavirus infection epidemic (COVID-19), which as of 3 March 2020 has claimed more than 3,120 lives and the number of infected has exceeded 91,000.
The alarm has been received and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses are zoonotic in origin, and their sources are bats, mice or domestic animals.
Numerous sets of data support the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronaviruses from bats, to whose organisms the viruses have adapted well and in which they do not exhibit pathogenic properties but show wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed a severe challenge to China and the world from a medical, scientific, social and moral perspective.
Research into the zoonotic mechanism of human coronaviruses will help us understand their natural history, the driving forces behind their evolution, and the factors that limit interspecies transmission.
It may also provide clues or speed up the search for a reservoir, intermediate and amplifying carrier of SARS-CoV-2, which is very important to prevent the disease from spreading again in the future.
This review provides general information on the zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we identify and address the following general feature: the original viruses from which human coronaviruses originated are usually not pathogenic to their reservoir carriers, but acquire pathogenic character after interspecies transmission to a new carrier.
We also analyze the evolutionary trend of human coronaviruses, which shows that increased transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also considered in this context.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HCoV-229E was first identified from a sample taken from the nasal cavity of a cold patient, various coronaviruses were found in various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronaviruses have been identified in the last decades.
Table 1 provides a brief history of human coronavirus detection in chronological order.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was obtained from samples taken from the respiratory tract of patients with infectious upper respiratory tract lesions in 1966; subsequently, this virus adapted to multiply in lung cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have shown cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, general malaise and sore throat, with high fever and cough being observed in 1020% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage into the brains of suckling mice.
The clinical signs of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCoV-229E infection, with symptoms indistinguishable from infection with other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are widespread in the world and are usually transmitted in winter in temperate latitudes.
The incubation period for these two viruses is generally less than a week, followed by about two weeks of illness.
According to the results of a study on volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients developed severe infections of the lower respiratory tract.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the "atypical pneumonia epidemic", was the first well-documented pandemic in human history caused by a human coronavirus, and was caused by SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus identified.
The first case of SARS was detected in late 2002 in China's Guangdong province.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases of illness and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread to many countries and continents.
Excluding the highly active carriers, it was estimated that each infected person could infect approximately two more people; the incubation period was 4 to 7 days, and the peak viral load was on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially developed muscle pain, headache, high fever, general malaise and chills, and later symptoms included shortness of breath, cough and shortness of breath.
Common abnormalities in SARS are lymphopenia, liver failure, and elevated creatine kinase.
In patients with SARS, diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells, and increased levels of macrophages are also seen.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical ventilation of the lungs.
In such severe cases, other organs may also become infected, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys, and this usually results in a cytokine storm that can be fatal, especially for immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the patient who had come to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a huge effort has been made to study human coronaviruses.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands.
It was first identified as mainly affecting young children, the elderly, and patients with weakened immune systems and respiratory diseases.
The disease caused by HCoV-NL63 is characterized by symptoms such as chills, conjunctivitis, high fever and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study described the same virus in nasal swabs taken from an 8-month-old boy in the Netherlands who had pneumonia.
The virus was discovered in the Netherlands, but it's actually everywhere.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for approximately 4.7% of widespread respiratory diseases, with peak incidence occurring in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to out-of-hospital pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with exacerbation of asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, a virus that causes mild respiratory illness, has been detected worldwide.
All four human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections have adapted well to humans, and their mutation leading to highly pathogenic diseases is generally unlikely, although incidents have occurred and their causes are unknown, as in the rare case of the more virulent subtype HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to have caused a serious lower respiratory infection in China.
Usually, as these human coronaviruses gain the ability to transmit and retain efficiently in the human body, they become less virulent or pathogenic.
The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure.
Most laboratory-confirmed cases have occurred in the Middle East, but there have been imported cases and spread through occasional secondary cases of close contact in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical manifestations of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)  both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other human-transmitted coronavirus diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome have been recorded with a high mortality rate (34.4%), so MERS-CoV is considered one of the deadliest viruses known to man.
In the mid-to-late December 2019 period, clusters of pneumonia patients were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which is now, looking back, associated with a severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus infection.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a global public health emergency, and the disease itself has been named coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
As of 3 March 2020, there are 90 053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 3,4%.
It should be noted that the death rate in China's Hubei province is 4.2%, and outside it  1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS and MERS coronaviruses, causes severe respiratory infection characterized by fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly progress to acute respiratory failure.
Despite the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has a greater ability to transmit compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
There have been cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating the virus's ability to spread rapidly around the world.
Comparisons and comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with six other human coronaviruses reveal important similarities and differences.
First, human-transmitted coronaviruses have similar incubation periods and duration of disease.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, in terms of severity of symptoms, COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are similar to those most commonly seen in human coronavirus infections that cause out-of-hospital infections, including nonspecific symptoms, mild symptoms or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases can be isolated, although the ratio is slightly lower here.
Third, there are also interesting patterns in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 that are characteristic of both human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses, which cause out-of-hospital infections.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e. infection of each subsequent person), as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
We have yet to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least under some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
Of particular interest is the question of the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, which is characteristic of human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections.
However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustained spread after transmission through humans.
All four human coronaviruses, which cause out-of-hospital infections with mild symptoms, have adapted well to humans.
On the other hand, it's possible that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both of them could be considered the only survivors of human coronavirus pandemics in the past.
Human coronaviruses that cause serious illness in humans, and people who have human coronaviruses that cause serious illness, simply did not survive.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate in the human body to a sufficient extent to accumulate adaptive mutations that counteract the carrier's limiting factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the chance that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, it will be difficult to stop transmission to humans through quarantine or other infectious disease control measures.
For many years, four out-of-hospital coronavirus strains have been circulating among the population, causing the common cold in people with healthy immune systems.
These viruses don't need a tank animal.
The highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronaviruses have not adapted well enough to humans and cannot be sustained from one person to another.
They need to survive and reproduce in their zoonotic tanks and look for an opportunity to strike susceptible human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or amplifying carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four outpatient HCoVs.
It's very easily transmitted as outpatient HCoVs, at least for now.
But it's more pathogenic than outpatient HCoVs, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen if it will adapt fully to humans and circulate in the human environment without a tank or with an intermediate host animal.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, intermediate, amplifying and reservoir carriers of HCoVs.
An animal is an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it carries a close relative with the same high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, the carrier-reservoir carries HCoV continuously over a long period of time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of the HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoVs were only introduced into an intermediate carrier just before or around the time they were introduced to humans, they were not well adapted to the new carrier and were often pathogenic.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of amplifying carrier, allowing the virus to replicate rapidly and then transmit it to humans, amplifying the scale of human infection.
HCoVs can transmit a dead end infection if they cannot withstand transmission within an intermediate carrier.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to an intermediate carrier and even establish long-term endemism.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reservoir carrier.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the zero SARS patient had a history of contact with hunting and fishing animals (wildlife).
Further seroprevalence studies showed that the prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV in animal traffickers was higher than in the general population.
Himalayan civets (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog at live animal markets were the first confirmed carriers of viruses similar to and almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that after all the civets were destroyed in the markets, no more SARS cases were reported.
At the same time, it was reported that in Himalayan civets living in the wild or on farms and not in markets, most cases of SARS-CoV were not detected, suggesting that Himalayan civets could only serve as an intermediate reinforcing carrier, rather than a natural reservoir for SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that since 80% of the various animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it cannot be ruled out that numerous species of small mammals may also be intermediate amplifying carriers.
They all seem to be dead end carriers of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent searches for a natural animal carrier of SARS-CoV identified a closely related bat CoV, which was named atypical pneumonia-associated bat coronavirus HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and which is present in Chinese bat bats.
These mice were positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
These and other bat coronaviruses have 8892% the same nucleotide sequence homology as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that bats were carriers of new human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none of them, except one that is designated WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
It is known that the receptor for SARS-CoV is human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
WIV1, derived from a bat fecal sample, has been shown to use ACE2 from bats, civet, and humans as a cell entry receptor.
Interestingly, the serum of patients recovering from SARS could neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest relative of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus of SARS-CoV, and bats are not the direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis places MERS-CoV in the same group as CoV-HKU4 of bats and CoV-HKU5 of bats.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptildipeptidase-4 (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.
The sequence of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of MERS-CoV is phylogenetically closer to the sequence from bat betacoronavirus identified in Europe and Africa.
Until now, no live MERS-CoV virus has been found in wild bats.
The homology of the MERS-CoV nucleotide sequences and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 in bats is only 87%.
So bats may not be the direct reservoir carrier of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that monohull camels are seropositive to MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, as well as camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
Live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the nasal swabs of monokomo camels, further confirming the role of camels as true reservoir carriers of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV showed mild symptoms but massive virus release.
It is noteworthy that the infected camels excrete the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal-oral tract, which is also the main route of virus excretion in bats.
However, questions remain as many confirmed cases of MERS-CoV did not have a history of camel contact before the onset of symptoms and are likely to be human-to-human or unknown, including unidentified animal species that are carriers of MERS-CoV.
The nucleotide homology of SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% consistent with the RaTG13 CoV of bats isolated from the Asian horseshoe Rhinolophus affinis.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the divergence in sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute parental relationships.
So bats may not be the direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2, unless near-identical bats coronaviruses are found in the future.
It is thought that the direct carriers of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species sold and killed in the wholesale seafood market in Wuhan, which has been linked to many of the initial cases of COVID-19, suggesting a likely case of animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may also carry the parent beta-coronavirus, a related strain of SARS-CoV-2.
The sequence homology of these new genome-wide nucleotides of the pangolin coronavirus is 8592% consistent with SARS-CoV-2.
But they're also closely related to RaTG13, with nucleotide sequence identity at about 90%.
They cluster into two sub-lineages of virus differentiation similar to SARS-CoV-2, in a phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RCD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
In contrast, the RSDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 strains are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology across the genome.
An earlier study of infected pangolins also reported the identification of viral continuums in samples from the lungs that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used other methods of assembly and manual processing to obtain a genome sequence that includes about 86.3% of the full-size viral genome.
It is possible that pangolins may have become one of the intermediate carriers of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the divergence in sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin beta-coronavirus, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin betacoronavirus.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been established.
While the highest sequence homology was found in the RCD between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin beta-coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest sequence homology within the entire genome.
Very theoretically, the high degree of similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related pangolin beta-coronavirus is due to parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposition advocates recombination between the SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin beta-coronavirus and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As a driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-coronavirus.
There is still no definitive decision on the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 is also being studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may originate from bat coronaviruses, while the parent viruses of the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 strains have been found in rodents.
It has been reported that the bat coronavirus, named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and detected in the North American three-colored sucker, shows a close relationship to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat coronavirus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that camels could also be intermediate carriers.
For clarity, current knowledge about the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of HCoV species-to-species transmission events in the history.
When HCoV-OC43 was transmitted between species around 1890 and humans were infected by domestic animals, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not so clear.
Bat alphacoronavirus, a close relative of HCoV-229E, has been detected.
In between is the alpaca alpha coronavirus.
Some evidence supports direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was humans, not alpacas, who were most likely to have contact with bats in the shared ecological niche.
At the same time, humans are in close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat alphacoronavirus, a relative of HCoV-229E, is diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alphacoronavirus has caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha coronavirus has not been detected in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be ruled out that alpacas may have contracted the alpha coronavirus, a related HCoV-229E, from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of pathogenic human viruses, including rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendrix.
It is therefore not surprising that bats could directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while bat alphacoronavirus could serve as the gene pool for HCoV-229E, alpacas and unicorn camels could be intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good example of interspecies transmission from bats to unicorns and from unicorns to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known from its initial identification and was subsequently confirmed by subsequent studies.
It's obvious that bats provide a rich pool of virus species for interspecies gene exchange and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction, and the ability to fly make bats the perfect carriers.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV was introduced by single-horned camels decades ago.
It has adapted well to these camels, which have gone from being intermediate carriers to being stable and natural tank carriers.
In these animals, MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and is characterized by relatively low mutation rates.
Its episodic transmission to humans is accidental, and humans remain a dead end carrier of MERS-CoV, as its transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, the beta-coronavirus of pangolins is highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be dead end carriers of beta-coronavirus, related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Future studies need to confirm or rule out several possibilities of interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First, bats may be a reservoir carrier for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share an ecological niche with bats by mining or cutting up the carcasses of these animals.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate amplifying carriers that a related SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently been infected with.
People get the virus by cutting up carcasses and eating wild animals.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Testing domestic and wild animals for antibodies is justified.
Third, as indicated above, SARS-CoV-2 could have recombined and adapted in a third species that came into contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
In addition to different types of animal hosts, three major factors on the part of viruses also contributed to the crossing of species barriers.
First of all, they have relatively high rates of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared with other single-chain RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of coronaviruses can be considered moderately high with an average replacement rate of about 104 replacements per year on one site 2 depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have a corrective exoribonuclease, which removal leads to an extremely high mutation rate and weakening or even inactivity.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir inhibits the replication of coronaviruses by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir  is one of the most promising drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that needs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of coronaviruses is almost a million times higher than that of their carriers.
In addition, the mutation rate can often be even higher if coronaviruses are not well adapted to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It's believed that the virus has already adapted to another carrier close to humans.
Apart from SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-tailed camels.
It is theoretically unlikely that vaccines and antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 will quickly lose their effectiveness as a result of genetic drift.
Second, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses leads to greater plasticity in genome modification with respect to mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies coevolution, which is favorable for the emergence of new coronaviruses under the right conditions.
This is facilitated by the numerous unique open reading frames and functions of proteins encoded in the 3′-end direction of the genome.
Third, thanks to a unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and frequently switch matrices during RNA replication.
During transcription of coronavirus DNA in a carrier that serves as a mixing vessel, there is often a switch in threads.
Highly homologous full-size and subgenome RNAs can recombine and create new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, and in animal coronaviruses such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 of bats.
The virus carrier interaction with respect to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, another key factor important for interspecies transmission is the interaction of the virus with the receptor of the carrier.
This article presents SARS-CoV recombination as a typical example that also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between human and civet SARS-CoV strains, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different carriers, especially with respect to mutations in the RSD of S protein.
In general, the RSD of the S protein of the coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor, and the host's antibody response intensively selects it.
The RSDs in SARS-CoV  are amino acids, from 318 to 510, on the S1 fragment, which binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (APF2) and its coreceptors to introduce the virus into the cell.
The SARS-CoV RSD is able to recognize APF2 receptors in different animals, including bats, civets, mice and enotape dogs, making interspecies transmission of the virus possible.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found in RSD, which are distinct from human and civet virus strains, with 4 of these being in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoV civets have K479N and S487T mutations in the RCD, which may increase the affinity of the spike-like protein's interaction with the human APF2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be particularly important for the virus' adaptation to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 segment of S protein suggests that the binding affinity of S protein to human APF2 may have changed.
Indeed, a study using a cryoscopic microscope says that the affinity of this link is 1020 times higher than between human APF2 and the S protein of SARS-CoV.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other coreceptors are required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to APF2, but to a different segment of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as amino peptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsilic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after interspecies transmission from animal carriers.
In addition to cell receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoV is also controlled by other factors of carrier dependence and restriction.
Divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural reservoir carriers of HCoVs, such as bats, monotremes and rodents, may represent a barrier to interspecies transmission.
For successful interspecies transmission, HCoVs must usurp the dependence factors and subjugate the restriction factors of the carriers.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-carrier interaction are still in need of definition and categorization.
Impartial full-genome screening of the carrier-dependent and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology may yield good results.
New HCoVs: back to zero
The diversity of bat coronaviruses creates wide opportunities for new HCoVs to emerge.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses serve as a genetic pool for HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving forces behind HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new genes that code for proteins has the potential to radically modify the phenotypes of viruses.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is considered important for adaptation to humans, as bats viruses related to SARS-CoV have been isolated, but found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
In strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoV coronaviruses was found.
This deletion breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates carrier change.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha- and gamma-coronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination localizations have also been identified in nonstructural proteins nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic underwent recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in monohyphoid camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events have also been observed in other HCoVs in which HCoVs have recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, most likely as a result of the virus being relieved of selection pressures, such as those exerted by the host's immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of full-size ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E due to di-nucleotide deletion.
While the intact open ORF4 reading frame can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha coronavirus exhibits single nucleotide insertion, which causes the frame to shift.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selection pressure on their reservoir carriers.
Infected bats with coronavirus showed mild symptoms or no symptoms, suggesting a mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It turns out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of the proinflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed by the apregulation of the NKG2/CD94 inhibitory receptor of natural killer cells and low expression of the major histocompatibility complex I class molecules.
Moreover, the high level of active oxygen forms, which is provided by the high metabolic activity of bats, can suppress the replication of the coronavirus, while also affecting the exoribonuclease reading, thus creating selection pressure to generate virus strains that are highly pathogenic when penetrating a new carrier.
More pathogenic strains of coronavirus can also evolve through recombination, which leads to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt to the carrier.
So it's no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged in the last 20 years.
Coronaviruses are nonpathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir carriers, such as bats or camels.
They replicate confidently without causing a strong immune response in the host.
This is the secret to why we see asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe human infections.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivity of the immune response and cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more serious the lung damage.
On the contrary, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is not associated with coronavirus replication.
The same strategy of unbinding the immune response may have beneficial effects in therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
Bats have a particularly strong interferon response.
Thus, taking interferon type I, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should have a beneficial effect.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in bats was impaired.
On this basis, inhibiting NLRP3-inflammasomes with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While bat beta-coronavirus has been found to have 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus that has 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that civets and other animals in markets carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no direct intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangolin betacoronavirus have been found, strikingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolins may have served as one of the intermediate carriers or that the gene fragments of pangolin betacoronavirus may have entered the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by humans.
Coronavirus has attracted worldwide attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoirs of HCoV in human transmission.
Convincing evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and have been transmitted to humans through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and civets in markets, closing wildlife markets and destroying civets there could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in light of the discovery of various lines of pangolin betacoronavirus, closely related to SARS-CoV-2, to prevent zoonotic transmission of infection from food markets, pangolins should be removed.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals and how this may occur remains a matter for future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long existed in unicorn camels.
These camels are an important means of transportation, as well as a major source of meat, milk, hides, and wool products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
So it's impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control MERS, as was done at wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop periodic MERS outbreaks, an integrated approach is needed to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we can't eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge that cause disease outbreaks.
There are a variety of zoonotic coronaviruses circulating in the world.
In particular, there is a huge variety of bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential.
There are many possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonotic coronaviruses, which in the future will lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more easily transmitted and/or more lethal to humans.
To reduce the amount of unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned in some areas of China.
After severe tests like SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plans are needed for such situations.
In fact, many viruses have been around on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until new territories are available.
While many of the properties of bats are conducive to the spread of viruses, if people are taught to stay away from them, the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized.
To better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers, we need continuous epidemiological surveillance of mammals, which will be useful to prevent transmission of coronaviruses from animals to humans and future outbreaks of disease.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
The puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 still lacks some fragments.
First, if bats transmitted the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it's interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmitting to humans, then we need to determine how humans came into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal is the true intermediate carrier, we need to understand how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be conducted.
Whether it's a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it's expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its precursor viruses will be identified in their natural carriers.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Diagnostic criteria for suspected cases and confirmed cases of COVID-19 need to be updated
On 6 February 2020, our team published a short guide to the diagnosis and treatment of the novel coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information on our experience and provides validated recommendations for the fight against this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been increasing gradually based on current research results and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continually updated.
In this letter, we respond to one comment regarding our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for suspected cases and confirmed cases in accordance with the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Therapeutic Guidelines (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of China.
In December 2019, a new coronavirus outbreak occurred (2019-nCoV), now officially named coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus disease itself was named severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a brief reference guide and published it online on the website of the journal Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This publication has attracted a great deal of attention.
Note that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been increasing gradually based on current research results and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continually updated.
For example, between January 16 and March 3, 2020, seven issues of the Recommendations for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 document published by the National Health Committee of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) were released, with some of its provisions substantially changed.
Recently, a paper by Zhou and co-authors has commented on our recommendations, offering simple diagnostic suggestions based on existing clinical experience.
This work added new practical evidence to our recommendations and provided valuable background information on this global pandemic.
We acknowledge the high importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (trial version 7) and current research, their work needs to be updated.
According to the seventh edition of this document (dated March 3, 2020), for conducting a comprehensive analysis when confirming a suspected case of the disease, it is necessary to combine any one element from the epidemiological history characteristics with two clinical manifestations of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan and its environs or in other settlements where COVID-19 cases were reported within 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive to a nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with high fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its environs or from other settlements where COVID-19 cases were reported within the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with groups of people with confirmed illnesses (≥ 2 cases of high fever or respiratory symptoms reported within 2 weeks in small areas such as a home or office, classroom, school, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) presence of external signs of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count is normal or low with reduced lymphocyte count at the early stage of symptoms.
For a confirmed case, diagnosis should be based on a suspected case with one of the following pathogenetic or serological evidence, namely: (1) a real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full genome sequencing of the virus shows high homogeneity with respect to novel coronaviruses; (3) positive serotest results for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies; or a change in test result from negative to positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies, or an increase in titer of at least 4 times in the recovery phase relative to the corresponding acute phase.
It should also be noted that the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) issues of the document added a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples.
Pathogenetic diagnosis of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) issues; and then in the seventh issue the need for serological evidence was added.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers seeking the optimal set for detecting nucleic acids in a rapid diagnosis, as well as for analyzing samples taken from the respiratory tract, including blood samples, which increases the availability of different samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the criteria for confirming the disease.
However, there is increasing evidence that caution should be exercised when treating patients with atypical symptoms and those without.
Thus, the route map presented in Zhou et al. should be updated, as it classifies persons without clinical symptoms as a "low risk" group.
The evaluation system also needs to be clarified in future clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we hope to obtain more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.
When it comes to diagnosing suspected and confirmed cases, we encourage readers to follow and strictly follow the latest recommendations in their countries of residence.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner to provide effective care.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths  daily high
Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths in a day yesterday.
That's the highest number of deaths from the virus in a single day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that 114 current cases and 33 recovered patients who were at home were among the reported cases.
There were 17 deaths.
In an online briefing, IEDCR Director Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two of the deceased were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old, and one was 41-50 years old.
She also reported that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
An employee of the clinic told local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait's Meitri Clinic.
In an online video statement on Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said public transport will be suspended for a longer period than originally planned, until next Saturday.
Public transportation was suspended from March 26 and was to resume on Saturday, April 4.
The transportation of essential goods  medicines, fuel and food  was still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Bangladesh on 8 March in two people who returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, these three people have recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has crossed the one millionth infection mark worldwide
According to Johns Hopkins University, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide exceeded one million on Thursday.
At least 52,000 people have died from the COVID-19 coronavirus.
The milestone came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first case of the coronavirus and Zambia recorded its first death.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries that had not reported any cases of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours before 10:00 Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, of which at least 5,900 have been fatal.
CBS News reported that more than 1,000 deaths from coronavirus infection were reported in the United States on Wednesday, citing data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have announced tougher measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin extended the self-isolation regime of the city's citizens until May 1.
Earlier, President Vladimir Putin said that Russians across the country, despite self-isolation, will receive wages until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days; the results of the vote: 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina by a full day, whereas previously the curfew was only from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand was planning to impose a curfew from 10pm to 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state's home isolation order has been extended through May 1.
Stores in Australia are limiting the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at a time
On Sunday and Saturday night, Australian retailers Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at once in all stores across the country to two and one pack respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also imposed a one-package restriction.
The restrictions were announced in the ads at the box office and on the Facebook page.
Citizens reportedly started making emergency stocks due to fears that COVID-19 could lead to the introduction of a general self-isolation regime.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one pack.
Earlier, on March 4 and 5, respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited this number to four packs.
Coles in its March 8 press release said that with the four-pack limit, "many stores are still selling too fast" for one supply within an hour, calling the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI in a Facebook post published on Tuesday called the trend "unexpected".
According to a representative for Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
Costco in Canberra last week also limited the number to two packs.
To make up the shortfall, Coles began ordering larger batches from suppliers and increased frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional batches, while ALDI made stock for a special early sale promotion on Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to replenish but were being hampered by local government restrictions on truck schedules.
He expects the cost of the product to rise as suppliers try to meet demand, but less and less good offers are available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some stores could not hold Wednesday's events due to stock runs.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said that stores are filling up every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky commodity, so there is little stock in the warehouse, and after all the goods are sold, long rows of shelves remain empty, exacerbating the feeling of lack of stock.
Coles and Woolworths believe that if shelves could be filled and items like toilet paper rolls and hand sanitizers could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, customers would probably not panic so much, says Russell Zimmerman.
Last Wednesday, Who Gives a Crap, a recycled toilet paper company, announced it was running out of supplies.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the toilet paper company Kleenex, and Solaris Paper, which also makes Sorbent branded products, said they are working around the clock to ensure sufficient supply.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that when auctions in Melbourne declined due to a lack of buyers during Labor Day weekend, some sellers began offering free toilet paper to first-time auctioneers.
The fourth edition of NT News, a daily newspaper published in Darwin, included an eight-page fold-out to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to a March 3 ABC Australia report, stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions on the number of items purchased, saying they had no plans to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, hand sanitizers, gluten, hand washing products and flour.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, it was noted on Sunday night that the online store of the British supermarket Ocado also limited the sale of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic of the infectious disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
Although the term pandemic only describes the extent of the disease, not the danger of specific cases, WHO notes that governments need to take measures:
All countries together are still in a position to influence the course of the pandemic.
This is possible if countries engage in identification, testing, treatment, isolation, surveillance and mobilisation of their citizens", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
We are deeply concerned both by the alarming level of spread and severity of the disease and by the alarming level of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is "unprecedented".
He said in an interview with CNN in February that "no other respiratory virus other than influenza has been traced from its inception to its continuing global spread".
Mr. Gebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying that we have never seen a pandemic caused by coronavirus.
We've also never seen a pandemic that we can control before.
First, in January, the WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, and then gave it a new status of a pandemic.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak: "This is just the beginning, it's going to get worse".
According to Associated Press, there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide as of Thursday, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 20192020 coronavirus pandemic is the current pandemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus.
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and a public health emergency of international concern was declared on 30 January 2020, which was subsequently declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, there were approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is 4%, while in the world it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome are possible complications.
The time from the first appearance of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
No vaccine or specific treatment has been found at this time.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recommended prevention measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping distance between people, identifying and isolating people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk controls and closures.
The pandemic has led to serious global socioeconomic consequences, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages of goods, exacerbated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities were closed nationally or regionally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of students worldwide.
Online misinformation about the virus has spread, and there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other citizens of East and Southeast Asia, or people who resemble them in appearance, as well as other groups of people living in areas where there are significant cases of the virus.
The reduction in travel and the closure of heavy industry have reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan (the capital of Hubei Province), China, reported cases of pneumonia with unknown cause, and in early January 2020, an investigation was launched.
The cases were mainly linked to the wholesale seafood market in Hunan, so the virus is thought to have zoonotic origins.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a newly discovered virus that has a lot of similarities to the bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first case of the disease occurred on December 1, 2019, and the infected person did not visit the market after that date.
Two-thirds of the cases reported in December 2019 were related to this market.
On 13 March 2020, a publication by the South China Branch of the Morning Post, whose information has not been verified, suggested that the first case of infection occurred in a 55-year-old resident of Hubei Province on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new cases in China had decreased, but was suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new cases outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new infections in China itself.
The incidence of the disease may be significantly lower, in particular because of the high number of cases with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, with patients aged 19 and under accounting for less than 2.4% of cases worldwide.The UK's Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance estimated that 60% of the UK population would be infected by the time effective herd immunity was established in the population.
The statistics include cases of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had been able to test more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland have adopted official policies that mandate no testing if only mild symptoms are present.
A study published on 16 March showed that 86% of COVID-19 cases had not been detected in China by 23 January, and that such unregistered patients were the source of infection for 79% of the reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of actual cases in Italy was significantly higher than the number of cases recorded.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproductive infection rate (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that the figure may be as high as 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients are recovering well.
In other, more complex cases, the time from onset of symptoms to death was 6 to 41 days, with the most common being  14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths were in people over 60 years of age, and 75% of the deaths were from comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.Official COVID-19 pandemic death data usually include deaths of patients with positive COVID tests performed according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not include people who died without being tested  for example, in the case of death at home, in nursing homes, etc.
The incomplete data for Italy indicate that the actual death toll during the pandemic was 45 times higher than the official COVID figures.
A spokesperson for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits: We know that [the reported death toll] is lower than the actual one. His words are supported by reports of some isolated cases in the US. Such accounts with incomplete data are often found in pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.
The first death outside mainland China was reported on February 1 in the Philippines, and outside Asia  in France on February 14.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths were reported outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths.
All indicators vary by region and time of disease spread; they are also influenced by testing volumes, quality of health systems, treatment regimens used, time since outbreak and population parameters such as age, gender and general health status.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of April 10, 2020, the global death rate and infection rate is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204).
The figures vary from region to region.
In China, the mortality-to-morbidity ratio has decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms on 110 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020).Other methods include determining the disease-related mortality rate (CFR)  the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from the disease, and the infection-related mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the numbers of certain populations from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these rates for specific groups of people.
According to the Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, the overall mortality rate from this pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39%.
The upper figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 testing in Germany, as well as a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR scores.
The WHO claims that the current pandemic is manageable.
The peak and exact duration of the outbreak cannot be determined and may vary depending on location.
Matsei Bony, a researcher at Penn State, says that uncontrolled outbreaks tend to reach a plateau and then, when the number of available carriers runs out, they begin to fade.
However, in the current situation, it is virtually impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen.
Senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, Zhong Nansheng, says that "it could all be over by June" if all countries can mobilize and follow WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 would be circulating, possibly within a year or two.
According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, "until a vaccine is developed (possibly 18 months or more) " physical distancing and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, a researcher at Vanderbilt University, said: "I don't think this coronavirus will ever go away completely because it's so easily transmitted and it can become a seasonal disease, flare up every year".
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on herd immunity and mutation levels.
COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively nonspecific, and some infected people may carry the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum formation in the airways (mucus), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, chills, vomiting, blood loss, diarrhea or cyanosis.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists urgent symptoms such as difficulty breathing, constant chest pain or tightness, sudden loss of consciousness, difficulty waking and facial or lip bruising. If these symptoms occur, seek immediate medical attention. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some people with the disease may have no symptoms, but the results of tests confirm that they are infected, so doctors recommend that people who have been in close contact with confirmed patients be closely monitored and tested for infection.
Chinese scientists estimate that the number of asymptomatic cases ranges from a few to 44 percent of all cases.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days.The symptoms of loss of smell are not yet fully understood: initial estimates suggest that the percentage of COVID-19 patients who developed this symptom was initially 30%, but then fell to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small droplets released into the air with coughing, sneezing, or during conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Some studies have shown that when you cough in public , the droplets can spread from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
There is speculation that the virus may also be transmitted through small droplets ejected into the air during conversation, which are able to remain in the air for a longer time. Respiratory droplets may also form when exhaling, including during conversation, although the virus is not usually transmitted through the air.
Drops can get into the mouth or nose of people nearby, as well as into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and CPR, can cause the products of the exhalation to be sprayed and thus spread the virus through the air.
It can also enter the body if a person touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through feces, but the risk of this transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although it can spread both before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
There have been cases where the tests have been positive when tested three days before symptoms appear, and this suggests the possibility of transmission before symptoms appear.
There are only a few laboratory-confirmed cases of asymptomatic transmission, but contact tracing studies in some countries have also identified cases of transmission from asymptomatic carriers.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one patient usually infects 23 others.
In particular, it was found that on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (304) the virus can live up to three days, on cardboard for one day, and on copper up to four hours.
However, these data vary depending on humidity and temperature.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that might have been touched by infected people.
Severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  is a new virus first identified in three people with pneumonia from the acute respiratory disease group reported in Wuhan.
All of the signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature in related coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed with household soap that dissolves its protective coating. SARS-CoV-2 has a lot of similarities to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It's thought to be of zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, a subgenus of Sarbecovirus (cell line B) along with two other strains of bat viruses.
At the whole genome level, it is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the genome sequences of pangolin viruses and humans.
A complete genome comparison to date has shown that the greatest percentage of similarity (92%) is between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts of the virus.
Virus infection can be diagnosed in advance based on symptoms, although this must eventually be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription (PCR) analysis of the infected secret or computed tomography.
A study comparing PCR and CT techniques used in Wuhan found that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although it is less specific, since many of its imaging functions coincide with other pneumonias and disease processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation not to use CT for screening or as a first-line test method in diagnosing COVID-19.
The WHO published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
Testing for polymerase chain reaction is performed in real time (RT-PCR).
It can be done on breath samples and blood samples.
The results are usually ready within a period of a few hours to a few days.
A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that can detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of them have been found to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, the serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of X-ray and CT imaging include asymmetrical peripheral clouding of matte glass and absence of pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international database of confirmed cases.
Because of similarities with other infections, such as adenovirus, images not confirmed by PCR tests have limited clinical specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT scans with PCR tests and found that although the images are less specific for infection, they can be decoded more quickly; they are also more sensitive, and therefore this diagnostic method can be considered as a screening tool in infected areas.
For diagnosing the virus with X-rays and computed tomography, clotting neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining general personal hygiene, hand washing, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, and using wipes when coughing or sneezing, which should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may have already been infected should wear a medical mask in public places.
Many governments recommend that people avoid any unnecessary travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and restrict movement of citizens.
However, the virus has managed to spread to most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading among a population, some members of which do not know where and how they were infected. Medical workers caring for patients who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions, as well as contact precautions and eye protection. Contact tracing is also an important method used by health authorities to identify the source of infection and prevent its further spread.
The use of government location data from people's mobile phones for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and organizations such as Amnesty International and more than 100 others have issued statements calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been developed and offered for voluntary use; as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on developing solutions to ensure privacy of personal data  for example, registering user proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user has been in close contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, they are notified.There are also unfounded versions of how to prevent infection  such as rinsing the nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.
At this time, there is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working on one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC also recommends frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or if your hands are heavily contaminated, and before eating, after snoring, coughing, or sneezing.
This is necessary because, when outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective membrane.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol.
The WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with dirty hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a number of solutions (on a surface made of stainless steel, the disinfectant begins to act a minute after application) containing 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0,1% sodium hypochlorite, 0,5% hydrogen peroxide and 0,2 7,5% povidone-iodine.
Other components, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that in cases of suspected or confirmed COVID in an institution, such as an office or day care center, all spaces in such a facility, including offices, restrooms, common areas, electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by sick people, be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that you cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief or a napkin when you cough or sneeze and throw away used hygiene items immediately.
Those who may have been infected are advised to wear medical masks, as the use of masks may limit the volume and range of exhalation products that are dispersed into the air during speech, sneezing and coughing.
The WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Steven Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, the use of a medical mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their face, and touching the face with dirty hands is the main way of infection. Masks are also recommended for those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as people who care for someone with COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that wearing a mask does reduce the number of facial contact.
Several countries have begun urging the use of medical masks in public places.
The CDC, U.S. Centers for Disease Control, recommends wearing non-medical cloth face masks.China has separately stressed the importance of single-use medical masks being used by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or in crowded places.
Thai health officials are urging people to make face masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is forbidden to go out without a mask covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, the Vietnamese government asked all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for all food shop visitors to wear medical masks.
The Israeli government also asked citizens to wear masks in public places.
On April 1, Taiwan, which has been producing ten million medical masks a day since mid-March, ordered all passengers on trains and intercity buses to wear medical masks.
In Panama, residents are required to wear a medical mask when outdoors; those who cannot afford masks have been advised to make their own at home.
Medical masks are also widely used by people in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing)  is a measure to control infection that aims to slow the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can use social distancing measures by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, using contactless greetings and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments in regions particularly hard hit by the outbreak are now mandating or recommending social distancing.
The maximum number of people allowed to gather in one place as recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was promptly reduced from 250 people (in regions where there were no COVID-19 data), to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned gathering in groups of more than two people. Older people and people with diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and weakened immune systems are at increased risk of contracting the virus in a serious form. The CDC recommends that they stay at home as long as possible if there is an outbreak in the region. In late March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began replacing the use of the term social distancing with physical distancing, thus clarifying the purpose of this measure to reduce physical contact within social connections, whether through virtual communication or physical distancing.
The use of the term "social distancing" was understood to mean that people should subject themselves to complete social isolation rather than remaining in contact with other people in alternative ways.Some agencies have published sexual health guidelines to be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, it was recommended that you only have sex with your regular partners, who you live with and who you know are free of the virus and its symptoms.
Individuals with a COVID-19 diagnosis and those suspected of being infected are advised to self-isolate at home.
Health authorities have published detailed guidelines on proper self-isolation, and governments in many countries have also mandated or recommended that all people in affected areas self-quarantine.
High-risk groups were placed under strict quarantine.
Persons who may have been in contact with COVID-19 infected persons, or who have recently visited a country or region that is significantly affected by the epidemic, have been recommended to quarantine for 14 days from the date of last possible contact.
Outbreak control strategies include containing, suppressing or mitigating the spread of the disease.
The prevention of disease spread is carried out in the early stages and aims to monitor and isolate the infected, and also implies other infection control measures and vaccination in order to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At a time when the spread of the disease is no longer contained, efforts are being made to mitigate the effects: measures are being taken to slow down the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health system and society.
Measures to prevent and mitigate the spread of the disease can be taken at the same time.
Infection suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the baseline number of infections to below level 1. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak of infectious disease is to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as epidemic curve alignment.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overloading health services and allow more time for developing vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help manage the outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, use of medical masks, and self-isolation; public measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass events; community involvement in and participation in the implementation of such measures; and environmental protection measures such as surface cleaning.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and has also set up a system to alert people of the movement of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to infected individuals who were in self-isolation and imposed large fines on those who did not.
In Taiwan, the manufacture of medical masks has been increased and fines imposed for over-stocking of medicines.Modelling in the UK and the US has shown that there are serious problems in mitigation (slowing down but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (stopping the growth of the epidemic).
The best policies to mitigate the spread of disease can reduce peak healthcare burden by two thirds and deaths by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of healthcare systems.
Suppression may be the preferred method, but it should be used as long as the virus circulates in the population (or until a vaccine is developed, if it happens sooner), as otherwise the spread of the disease will quickly resume when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to contain the pandemic has social and economic costs.
There are currently no approved antiviral drugs for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medicines, drinking plenty of fluids, and resting can help to alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid injection, and respiratory support.
Steroid use can only be harmful.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also being considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also reported that some "traditional and home remedies" may alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers capacity building and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients as the primary response to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health care services to facilitate resource redistribution at several levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, eliminating non-emergency procedures where possible, identifying the virus and isolating patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, and expanding the capacity of intensive care by training staff and increasing the number of available VTE devices and beds.
There are various theories as to where the first case of infection, the so-called "zero patient", may have originated.
The first known case of a new coronavirus infection was reported on December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei province has been steadily increasing.
They were mainly linked to the wholesale seafood market in Hunan, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus entered the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a case of a mass illness with pneumonia of unknown origin was reported in a Hubei province clinic, with which doctor Zhang Tianjin worked, who reported the case to the Jianghan Disease Control and Prevention Center in Wuhan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan City Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a coronavirus similar to SARS.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police about responsibility for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ai Feng, was reprimanded by her superiors for causing panic.
Later, on December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice and informed WHO about the situation.
Wuhan health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which was large enough to initiate an investigation in early January.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by Chinese New Year holidays and the fact that Wuhan is a transport and rail hub.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new cases in one day, including two cases in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to later official data, by 20 January 2020, symptoms of the disease had appeared in 6,174 people. As of 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy in the world in the number of confirmed cases. As of 9 April 2020, there were over 1.61 million cases worldwide, over 97,000 deaths, and over 364,000 recoveries.
Some 200 countries and territories have at least one reported case.
Due to the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and imposed border controls.
National response measures included measures to contain the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as mandatory stay-at-home, mandatory house shelter, or isolation), as well as curfew.As of April 2, about 300 million people, or about 90% of the population of the United States, were in some form of quarantine, with more than 50 million people in isolation in the Philippines, about 59 million people in isolation in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later, that number had risen to 2.6 billion people  about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan on 1 December 2019; according to another report, the validity of which has not been verified, this date is  17 November.
On December 26, Dr. Zhang Jiaxiang was working on a case of an unknown type of pneumonia, which was reported to the Jianghan Disease Control and Prevention Center in Wuhan on December 27.
The initial genetic testing of patients' samples, which took place on 27 December 2019, showed the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.
The WHO was notified the same day.
In response to such notifications, police warned doctors in Wuhan about responsibility for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
Initially, the Chinese National Health Commission claimed that there was no clear evidence of the newly discovered virus' ability to transmit from person to person.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to contain the spread of the virus, which was later dubbed a "people's war" by Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping.
Events began to unfold in the "largest-scale quarantine in human history", on January 23, a sanitary cordon was declared and a ban on entry into Wuhan and back was announced, later this measure was extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei province and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The city has banned the use of personal transport.
Many places have canceled celebrations for Chinese New Year (January 25).
The government also announced the construction of a temporary hospital in HuoshenShan, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital, Leishengshan, was built to house other patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also re-designated 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, as temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government took additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health certificates for travellers and extending the Chinese New Year celebration period.
Universities and schools were closed across the country.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular for schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced remote working.
Travel restrictions have been imposed in Hubei province and beyond.
Public transportation was re-scheduled and museums across China were temporarily closed.
Many cities have introduced a movement control regime, and it has been estimated that around 760 million people (more than half the population) have faced some form of outdoor movement restrictions.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travelers entering the city, and as of March 23, only one case of infection had been reported in mainland China, which occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person who had returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang announced that the spread of the disease was largely contained and the outbreak in China was under control.
On the same day, travel restrictions to Hubei, except for Wuhan, were lifted, two months after the province was closed for quarantine. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that entry for persons with a visa or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March.
Those wishing to come to China will need to apply for a visa at a Chinese embassy or consulate.
On 30 March, the Chinese government called on businesses and factories to resume work and provided companies with a package of monetary incentives. On 4 April, a national three-minute "minute silence" was held at 10:00 a.m. to mark the start of a day of mourning for coronavirus victims declared by the country's State Council to coincide with the Quoc Minh holiday, but the central government asked citizens to pay their respects online by observing physical distancing to avoid a repeat outbreak of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On February 20, the National Health Ministry reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases, largely due to the large number of followers of a new religious movement known as the Shinchonjie Jesus Church in Taegu.
Shinchonjis came to Taegu from Wuhan, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, out of 9,336 church members, 1,261 (about 13%) reported having symptoms of the disease.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, and by February 29, the number had risen to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were placed in quarantine after testing confirmed three soldiers had the virus.
The outbreak affected travel, so airline flight schedules were changed. South Korea has launched a program to screen the population for the virus, track contacts and arrange quarantine measures for contacts. This program is considered the largest and best in terms of its organization worldwide.
Screening methods included requiring all foreign visitors to report their symptoms via a mobile app, head-to-head testing for the virus, which was done the next day, and expanding testing capacity to test up to 20,000 people daily.
South Korea's program is considered successful in combating the outbreak, despite the fact that it did not isolate entire cities.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for impeaching Mr. Moon for what they felt was the government's inadequate response to the outbreak.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had recorded the lowest total number of cases in a single day in four weeks.
On March 29, a notice was received that from April 1, all new arrivals from abroad would be placed on a two-week quarantine.
According to media reports, 121 countries have asked South Korea for help testing for the virus as of April 1.
On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Qum, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
The first measures introduced by the government included cancelling concerts and other cultural and sports events, Friday prayers, and closing universities, colleges and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani announced on 26 February 2020 that the government did not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individual individuals would be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to limit long-distance travel, but intensive travel between cities continued before the Persian New Year.
Shiite shrines in Qum were open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020, when Iran became the epicenter of the virus after China in February.
Amid claims of a cover-up of the outbreak in Iran, as of February 28, more than a dozen countries have linked their cases to Iran, indicating that the scale of the outbreak there may be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to that date.
Iran's parliament was closed, and 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus, as reported on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, as well as temporarily release all prisoners who fit the category.
The organization says there is an increased risk of the virus spreading in closed institutions, such as prisons, where there is a lack of adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day  the highest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
By March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
By March 23, Iran had 50 new cases of coronavirus every hour and one new death from coronavirus every ten minutes.
According to a WHO official, the incidence rate in Iran may be five times higher than the official data.
It is also thought that US sanctions on Iran could affect the country's financial capacity to protect itself from the spread of the virus.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded that economic sanctions be eased against countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the disease was confirmed to have entered Italy when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
The number of cases has been rising rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
An unrelated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later detected. It all started with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law on containment of the outbreak, according to which more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were placed in quarantine.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: "Entering and leaving the outbreak zone will be blocked.
The Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities across the country on March 4, as 100 deaths had already been recorded in Italy at that time.
All major sporting events, including A-League football matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March all sporting events were postponed for at least one month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of businesses except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Anesthesia, Reanimation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics guidelines regarding patient care queuing protocols, which may need to be implemented.
On 19 March, Italy overtook China in the coronavirus death rate, taking first place in the world, after announcing 3,405 deaths.
On March 22, it became known that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries, with most of these cases concentrated in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report said that Italy's high death rate may be due to a combination of two factors: the country's large number of elderly citizens and the lack of ability to screen all those currently infected with the coronavirus.
The United Kingdom has responded to the virus most calmly of all affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British government did not require citizens to observe any form of social distancing or quarantine measures.
As a result, the government was criticized for not reacting quickly and seriously enough to the danger facing the country's population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending that people refrain from all non-essential travel and social contact, advising people to work from home if possible and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that all entertainment venues such as pubs and sports clubs should close as soon as possible, and promised working citizens to pay up to 80% of wages, but no more than £2,500 a month, as a measure to support the population during the crisis.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were imposed with the involvement of police, fines and dispersing crowds.
Most businesses were ordered to close, except for those that provide "life activities for the population", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, convenience stores, gas stations and garages.
On January 20, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the Pacific Northwest state of Washington was a man who returned from Wuhan on January 15.
On January 29, a Task Force on the Coronavirus was established at the White House.
On January 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency and imposed restrictions on entry for travelers from China.
On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. government's leading public health organization, announced that it had developed its own test kit.
Despite this, testing of the population in the United States was not started immediately, and as a result, the true scale of the outbreak during this period was hidden.
Testing was hampered by a lack of test kits released by the federal government in February, the lack of federal government approval by the end of February to use non-state test kits that were being developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, and restrictive criteria by the beginning of March that would allow citizens to be tested (this could only be done by prescription).
The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States as of February 27.
The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted by March 13.
On March 22, Associated Press reported: "Many patients, even with symptoms and appointments, waited in line for hours or days for tests". After Washington State reported the first coronavirus death in the United States on February 29, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, which was soon followed by other states.
On March 3, Seattle schools were cancelled, and by mid-March schools were closed across the country. On March 6, 2020, a group of epidemiologists from Imperial College, London, informed the United States of the new coronavirus's predicted impact on the country.
On the same day, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Additional Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency assistance to federal authorities to respond to the outbreak.
Corporations imposed travel restrictions, canceled conferences, and urged employees to work from home.
Sports events and seasons were canceled. On March 11, Trump announced travel restrictions to most of Europe, except the UK, for 30 days, starting March 13.
The next day, he expanded the restrictions to include the UK and Ireland.
On March 13, the president declared a state of emergency in the country, which made it possible to use federal funds to combat the crisis.
Starting March 15, many businesses have been closing or reducing hours across the United States to help combat the spread of the virus.
By March 17, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. On March 23, it was reported that New York had 10,700 cases in a day, which is more than the total number of cases in South Korea.
On March 25, the governor said social distancing was likely an effective measure, as doubling estimates dropped from 2.0 to 4.7 days.
As of March 28, New York had 32,308 confirmed cases and 672 deaths. It was reported that on March 26, the United States had more confirmed cases of coronavirus infection than any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of April 8, the United States of America had 400,335 confirmed cases, with 12,841 deaths.
According to media reports on March 30, President Trump has decided to extend the social distancing period until April 30.
On the same day, the 1,000-bed USNS Comfort hospital ship docked in New York Harbor.
On April 3, 884 deaths from coronavirus were recorded in the United States within 24 hours.
The White House has been criticized for underestimating the threat and censoring public information by using the office of Vice President Mike Pence to monitor public statements and publications by health officials and scientists related to the virus.
In general, the views of President Trump's supporters on how successfully he manages to deal with the crisis have been divided.
Some officials and commentators have criticized the U.S. dependence on imports of critical materials, including basic necessities, from China.
In mid-January 2020, the journal Travel Medicine published an analysis of air travel schemes, which was used to map and predict disease spread patterns.
Based on the International Air Transport Association's 2018 data, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei received the most travelers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.
Of the 20 most popular tourist destinations, Bali was named the least prepared for the outbreak, while Australian cities were considered the most prepared.On 7 February, Australia adopted its emergency response plan for the new coronavirus (COVID-19).
In this regard, it is said that much remains to be learned about COVID-19, and that Australia will pay special attention to border control and communication in the event of a threat.
On 21 March, Australia declared a state of emergency in the field of human biosecurity.
Due to the effective quarantine measures implemented in the public transport sector in Wuhan and Hubei, some countries have planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic personnel from the area, mainly by charter flights to their home countries, which the Chinese authorities have given their permission to do.
Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand were among the first to plan to evacuate their citizens.
Pakistan has said it will not evacuate its citizens from China.
On February 7, Brazil evacuated 34 Brazilians/relatives of Brazilians, as well as four Poles, a Chinese and an Indian citizen.

On February 15, the United States announced that it would evacuate U.S. citizens aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
On February 21, a plane carrying 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess landed in Trenton, Ontario.
In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On 14 March, a South African Airways aircraft chartered by the South African government took off with 112 South African citizens on board.
Passengers were screened before departure, and four South Africans who showed signs of coronavirus were left in China to reduce the risk.
Only South Africans with negative coronavirus tests were evacuated.
Tests were taken from all South African citizens, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, and they all remained under observation and quarantine for 14 days at The Ranch Resort as a precaution.
On March 20, the United States began a partial withdrawal of its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.
On February 5, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt and Iran) had sent their aid to China.
Some Chinese students studying at American universities have joined together to collect and send aid to regions of China affected by the virus, with a Chicago group reportedly sending 50,000 N95 respirators to Hubei province clinics on January 30.Humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief, in conjunction with FedEx, sent 200,000 medical masks and other personal protective equipment, including gloves and gowns, to Wuhan Union clinic by an ambulance by January 30.
On February 5, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a donation of $100 million to the WHO to fund the development of a vaccine and treatment for coronavirus, as well as to protect the population of risk groups in Africa and South Asia from the threat of the virus.
Interaksiyon reported that on February 6, the Chinese government donated 200,000 medical masks to the Philippines after Senator Richard Gordon sent 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.
On February 19, the Singapore Red Cross announced that it was going to send $2.26 million in aid to China.
Japan also donated one million medical masks to Wuhan, Turkey sent medical equipment, Russia  over 13 tons of medicines, Malaysia announced a donation of 18 million medical gloves, Germany sent various medical supplies including 10,000 protective kits, the United States donated 17.8 tons of medicines, and also pledged $100 million in financial support to affected countries.
In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medicines and experts to Italy to help the population cope with the coronavirus outbreak.
Businessman Jack Ma has sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million medical masks and 60,000 protective suits to the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the organization to distribute to its member states.
Later, he also sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 medical masks, and 5 VTE machines to Panama.
Ma also donated medicines to Canada, while the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic have expressed concern about Chinese-made medical masks and testing kits.
For example, Spain recalled 58,000 Chinese coronavirus test kits that were only 30% accurate, and the Netherlands recalled 600,000 defective Chinese medical masks.
Belgium also recalled 100,000 unusable medical masks: they were thought to have been made in China, but later it was discovered that they came from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On April 2, the World Bank began implementing emergency assistance operations to developing countries.
The WHO praised the Chinese authorities' efforts to combat the epidemic and contain the spread of the infection.
WHO noted clear differences between the 2002-2004 outbreak of pneumonia, in which Chinese authorities were accused of withholding information that allegedly prevented the disease from spreading, and the current crisis, when the central government regularly provided updates on the situation to avoid panic on the eve of Chinese New Year.
On 23 January, in response to the central government's decision to impose a travel ban in Wuhan, WHO spokesman Goden Galea noted that although the measure was definitely not recommended by WHO, it is also "a very important confirmation of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place of greatest spread" and called it "unprecedented in the history of public health". On 30 January, after the ability of the infection to spread from person to person outside China and the increase in cases in other countries was confirmed, WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Importance (PHEIC); this was the sixth such emergency since 2009, when it was first implemented during the swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the announcement of PHEIC was due to the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries that do not have robust health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr Tedros said that there was "no reason for measures that unduly hamper international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement".
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the international community for US$675 million to provide strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, saying that urgent assistance was needed for countries that "do not have systems to detect people infected with the virus, even though the epidemic has not yet reached those countries".
Mr Tedros also stated that "a measure of our preparedness" is the degree to which we are prepared for an epidemic at our weakest link", and called on the international community to "make a choice between investing today or paying for it in the future".
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide "the potential of the entire UN system in response to the challenge".
The result was the creation of the UN Crisis Management Group to coordinate all United Nations responses, which the WHO says will allow "to focus on health response, while other agencies can use their experience to address the outbreak in a broader social and economic context".
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated the establishment of a joint task force that provided international experts and WHO staff with local work in China to assist in domestic management and assess the "seriousness and contagiousness" of the disease, organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, and conducted field trips to assess the "effectiveness of provincial and county-level responses, including urban and rural areas". On 25 February, WHO said that the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic, noting that it was too early to call it a pandemic, but that countries should nevertheless be prepared.
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the likelihood of a global spread of the coronavirus would be raised from "high" to "very high" to the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergency programme, warned in a statement: "This is a test of every government on the planet for readiness to deal with the reality of the situation: it's time to act.
The virus may already be on its way to your country and you need to be prepared, and stressed that the right response measures can help the world avoid the "worst case scenario".
Ryan also stated that current data does not justify a global pandemic by public health officials, adding that a pandemic would mean that "we are basically acknowledging the fact that every person on the planet is at risk of being infected with this virus".
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The WHO Director-General stated that WHO is "deeply concerned both by the alarmingly high level of spread and severity of the disease and by the equally alarming level of inaction in relation to this problem". WHO has been severely criticized for its perceived inadequate approach to the concept of pandemic, including the later declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
In response to the situation, a petition to resign from the post of WHO Director-General, Mr Tedros Adhanom, was submitted and signed by 733,000 people as of 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting the rights of every human being during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The panel said that everyone has the right to life-saving measures and that the government has a responsibility to ensure that they are implemented.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should in no way be used as a justification for discrimination against any particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone has the right to health protection, including people with disabilities, members of minority groups, elderly citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless people, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of state support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has established a platform designed to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to share views and provide recommendations.
The Digital Hub provides information on countries' policy measures (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the global economy, address quarantine and travel restrictions, and help countries learn from each other and promote coordinated global responses to the coronavirus.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gow and Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for its actions to combat the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of provincial-level leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were fired for the quarantine measures they had taken in central China, and these firings reflected dissatisfaction with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe the move was aimed at protecting Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, have expressed disagreement with earlier claims that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, but have sided with the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in the US or Italy.
The administration of US President Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as the China virus or Wuhan virus, stating that censorship in China only exacerbates the situation with the virus, which has now become a global pandemic, and this statement has in turn been criticized by some commentators who claim that such an approach is racist and distracts from the US administration's inability to contain the spread of the disease.
The Daily Beast has accessed a US government cable that contains a communications strategy ruse apparently devised by the National Security Council, with such references to strategy as:
We are being asked to spread this information by any means possible, including press conferences and television appearances. Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have said that China's efforts to help countries affected by the virus are part of a "propaganda effort" to gain global influence.
The EU's foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, warned of a "geopolitical component, including a struggle for influence through public relations and the so-called politics of generosity".
Borrell also said that "China is pushing the idea of its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the US".
China has also urged the US to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with some reports suggesting it has sent aid to the latter two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned due to US sanctions imposed on April 3.
The U.S. government is also accused of diverting aid destined for other countries to its own country.
Disputes over medical masks have also arisen between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has appropriated hundreds of IEDs destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of support from the European Union regarding the coronavirus-affected Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said only China had responded bilaterally.
This is not a clear sign of European solidarity.
On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin organized the dispatch of Russian military sanitarians, specialized disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80% of Russian aid was "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favorable impression on the world community at the geopolitical and diplomatic levels.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected the media's attacks and expressed gratitude for the assistance.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "by offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that as American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase production, they will also be able to provide counter-assistance if necessary".
NATO's Defender 2020 military exercises, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, the largest NATO military exercises since the end of the Cold War, will be held in a shortened format.
Defender 2020 was criticized by Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Secretary Kate Hudson: "In the current public health crisis, the conduct of these exercises endangers not only the lives of the US military and many European participating countries, but also the lives of the people in countries where such exercises are to be conducted".
On 14 March 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help, saying his country was experiencing difficulties in combating the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets due to US sanctions against Iran. The epidemic has prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of a single healthcare and childcare system, paid family leave and increased public health funding.
Political scientists had expected that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine measures" after Japan announced that any citizen arriving from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially divided by President Moon Jae-in's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for impeaching Mr. Moon for what they felt was the government's inadequate response to the outbreak.
Some commentators are concerned that the move will allow governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, parliament voted to give Prime Minister Viktor Orban indefinite power to rule by decree, suspend parliament, hold elections and punish those accused of spreading false information about the virus and government measures to combat the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several supply shortages due to the global increase in the use of equipment to fight the epidemic, panic buying and disruptions in production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment, which have been caused by increased consumer demand and supply disruptions.
In several settlements, panic shopping also took place; this led to a situation where basic goods such as food, toilet paper and bottled water disappeared from store shelves, which in turn led to a shortage of stocks.
The tech industry, in particular, is warning of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This jump has led to a 20-fold increase in prices compared to normal and a four- to six-month delay in the supply of medical devices.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and the WHO has warned that health workers will be hit hard by it.
In Australia, due to the pandemic, daigoo customers have a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
This activity led to a shortage of baby food in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food, acute food shortages were avoided in both areas.
Successful measures taken by China and Italy to curb the stockpiling and smuggling of critical products have avoided the severe food shortages that were expected in Europe as well as North America.
Northern Italy, which has small-scale agricultural production, has not experienced significant declines, but industry officials say prices for agricultural products may rise.
Food stores were temporarily empty, even in Wuhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pork supplies to feed the population.
Similar laws require food producers to store food supplies in case of emergencies.
The damage to the global economy has also affected China: according to media reports on March 16, China's economy suffered heavily in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to combat the spread of the virus, which led to a 20.5% decline in retail sales.
Mainland China  is a major economic and manufacturing center; therefore, the virus outbreak is considered to pose a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
Agatha Demarai, of the Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that volatility in markets will persist until a clearer picture of potential outcomes emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic on global growth could exceed the impact of the 2002-2004 atypical pneumonia epidemic.
One estimate by an expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimates that the global supply chain could be more than $300 billion in the hole, and the negative impact could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to have taken "urgent measures" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to a drop in demand from China.
On February 24, global stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various US stock indexes, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, showed their sharpest decline since 2008, with the Dow falling 1191 points, the largest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007-08.
By the end of the week, all three indices had fallen by more than 10 percent.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Stocks fell again due to fears about the spread of the coronavirus, with the biggest drop occurring on March 16.
Many believe that there is a possibility of an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and states.
Central banks are responding faster than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism  is one of the sectors most affected by travel restrictions, closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations to avoid any travel.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines cancelled flights due to a sharp decline in demand for airline tickets, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional airline Flybe ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise industry has never been greater.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The outbreak coincided with Chong-Yun, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year celebrations.
National and regional governments canceled a number of large-scale events, including the annual New Year's Eve festivals; private companies also closed their stores and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneylands, on their own.
Many New Year's Eve events were canceled and tourist attractions were closed to prevent crowds; for example, the Forbidden City in Beijing was closed and traditional temple fairs were canceled.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and districts, authorities extended the New Year's holiday until February 10, instructing most businesses not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong authorities have raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling New Year celebrations.
Visitation of retail outlets in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East have reduced sales by 50 to 60 percent.
As a result, attendance at shopping malls fell by 33-43% in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world have introduced additional measures such as improved sanitation, installation of temperature-checking equipment for visitors, and cancellation of events.According to an assessment by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic could leave 14.22 million more people behind than would have been in a similar situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of the 300 million Chinese migrant farm workers are at home in their provinces or locked up in Hubei province.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States, and the unemployment rate could reach 32%.The self-isolation measures introduced in India will put tens of millions of Indian migrant workers who receive daily wages out of work.A study by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have somehow faced unemployment.Almost 900,000 Spanish workers have also lost their jobs since Spain imposed strict isolation in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a single social benefit.
The German part-time wage scheme was also introduced in France and Britain.
The arts and cultural heritage sectors have also been hit hard by the pandemic, which has affected organizations and individuals, whether officially employed or self-employed, around the world.
Culture and arts organisations have tried to support their (often state-funded) mission of ensuring access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their staff and the public, and also, where possible, supporting artists.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely around the world, or access was restricted to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events and performances were canceled or rescheduled.
In return, there have been active efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and growing effect of the spread of the virus  cancellation of religious services, major sports events and other public events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican has announced the cancellation of the Holy Week in Rome, which is held in the last week of the Christian penitential period  Great Lent.
Many dioceses are recommending that older Christians stay home and not attend services on Sundays; some churches have begun to broadcast services on radio, live, or television, while some church leaders are suggesting that services be held outdoors.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closed its churches, chapels and St. Peter's Square to visitors, and later other religious organizations also canceled services and restricted access to public worship in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the coronavirus outbreak, and shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and its own residents from visiting the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes to the calendar of world sporting events since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 201920 UEFA Champions League, the 201920 UEFA Euro 2020 Premier League, the 201920 NBA season and the 201920 NHL season.
The coronavirus outbreak also destroyed plans to hold the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to begin in late July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be postponed to the period after 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021.
This has led to many players moving online, and many gambling sites reporting a significant increase in new subscribers.The entertainment industry has also suffered as various music bands have suspended or canceled concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as Broadway, also canceled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline activities, some artists and musicians have begun exploring options to continue their activities and share their results online, by hosting live streaming online concerts or web festivals; this helps people in creative professions to continue performing, releasing or publishing their works.
There are a lot of internet memes about the coronavirus, many of which are humorous and smooth out the anxiety of uncertain times.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against Chinese citizens and people of East Asian descent, as well as people from hotspots in Europe, the US and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been reported in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
News reports for February (when most cases were still confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed by various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received fair compensation for something.
Anti-Chinese sentiment is also on the rise in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Chinese citizens, as well as those living in the affected areas, were provided with offline and online support.
The epidemic has started to spread to new countries, particularly Italy  the first country in Europe to face a serious COVID-19 outbreak; therefore, citizens in such regions may also start to feel the effects of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea signed a petition at an early stage, insisting on banning Chinese citizens from entering their countries in order to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan (#ChineseDon'tComeToJapan) was a top Twitter post.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States, report increasing levels of racism and even attacks.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus"; critics consider this view to be racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Wuhan to New Sanjar.
Students coming from northeastern India bordering China and studying in major cities in India have reported cases of harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party's state wing, West Bengal, said the Chinese destroyed nature and "so God has avenged them".
Later, these statements were condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, which called them "misleading". In China, due to the pandemic, xenophobia and racism against residents who are not Chinese citizens flared up again: foreigners were called "foreign garbage" and "objects to be recycled".
Many free newspapers have removed such restrictions for some or all areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles about the coronavirus outbreak publicly available.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to their research results on preprint publishing servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and its related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods to detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by OT-PCR, which recognizes the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is only intended to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It's used to confirm a fairly recent or active infection.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population control.
Antibody tests reveal the number of people who have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too mild to be hospitalized or who were absent.
The exact death rate from this disease and the level of herd immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing capabilities, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and reports on the number of tests conducted in different countries are highly conflicting.
Such differences in data likely have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which in some countries may be significantly exaggerated.
Using real-time polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on samples from the respiratory tract obtained in a variety of ways, including a nasopharyngeal swab or a sputum sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
A CT-PCR test on a swab taken from the throat is only valid for the first week of illness.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, but it can still multiply in the lungs.
In infected patients, testing in the second week of illness may alternatively involve taking material from the lower respiratory tract with a suction catheter or using exhalation products (sputum).
One of the earliest PCR tests was developed at the Charité Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis of 250,000 kits that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its own test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a kit for detecting SARS-CoV-2 based on clinical level PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It detects the E gene, common to all beta-coronavirus, and the RdRp gene, specific to SARS-CoV-2.The Chinese company BGI Group became one of the first companies to receive permission from the National Drug Administration of China to use the emergency PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) in public health laboratories through International Reagent Resource.
One of three genetic tests from older versions of the test kits produced incomplete results due to faulty reagents and the narrow testing area conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; resulting in an average of less than 100 samples being successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that date were state and local laboratories allowed to begin testing.
The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as part of an emergency use authorization.U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing across the country.
Quest Diagnostics began testing for COVID-19 nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been stated; collection and processing of tests must be done in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VEKTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Service. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval to use a test that can be run for 3.5 hours on a large sample volume, allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to conduct tests of the Abbott m2000 system; previously the FDA issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received EUA from the FDA for a test lasting about 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of temperature cycles, the method can detect positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the U.S., and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day.A monoclonal antibody test is currently being developed in Taiwan that binds specifically to the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) of the new coronavirus, and hopes to be able to provide results in 15-20 minutes, similar to an express flu test.
A review of the March 2020 peer-reviewed literature concluded that chest X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, whereas CT scans may have such value even before symptoms appear.
Typical CT features include two-sided multi-dome subpleural focuses of matte glass with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance, a symptom of a pebble bridge, and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT techniques used in Wuhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its imaging functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation not to use CT for screening or as a first-line test method in the diagnosis of COVID-19. As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for initial screening.
The immune response to infection is partly expressed in the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity and for population control purposes. Analyses can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by spot diagnosis (PoCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to be performed by highly automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each such system.
CLT usually uses a single sample of peripheral blood, although serial samples may be used to track immune response.
In PoCT, one blood sample is usually taken by puncturing the skin.
Unlike PCR, the blood-testing stage is not required for the test tube. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have completed all necessary registration procedures and can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA has approved only one emergency use authorization test. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorizations to use their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples that have the ability to fight the virus.
The test yield is several hundred samples in a few hours, and therefore the method works much faster than a conventional PCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after infection, but in early April the UK found that none of the antibody kits it had purchased had given satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients with suspected virus to stay at home: Emergency room staff hand the patient a test tube for a sample, the patient spits in it, returns it and after some time receives the test results.The British NHS has announced the launch of its pilot scheme for testing suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient infecting other clinic visitors or the need to disinfect an ambulance if it was used to transport a patient.In the case of suspected cases, the healthcare worker takes the test using all appropriate precautions during the COVID-19 express test.
Express testing centers have helped South Korea to organize one of the fastest and largest testing procedures of any country.On March 2, the National Association of Physicians with Compulsory Health Insurance in Germany said it was ready to conduct about 12,000 tests a day in outpatient settings, compared to only 10,700 tests a week earlier.
If the examination is prescribed by a doctor, the costs are covered by the health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's overall testing performance is 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, it was proposed to conduct express testing in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that as of calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 tests had been taken for SARS-CoV-2 up to and including week 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were positive.Researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital in Israel developed and tested a method of simultaneously testing samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples and only conducting further testing if the combined sample shows a positive result.In Wuhan, on 5 February 2020, BGI opened a temporary emergency detection laboratory with an area of 2,000 square meters called 胡洋 (Chinese: 火眼, or 眼), which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
The construction of this laboratory was organized by BGI founder Wang Jian and completed in just 5 days; the modeling showed that if this laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated pace, the incidence of disease in Hubei would have been 47% higher, and accordingly, the quarantine costs would also have been twice as high.
The opening of the Wuhan laboratory was followed immediately by the opening of Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai  in a total of 12 cities in China.
By 4 March 2020, the daily total capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Open multiplex Origami Assays were released, which can test up to 1,122 tests of patients for COVID19 using only 93 test tubes. Such balanced designs can work in small laboratories, eliminating the need for robotic fluid manipulators.
By March, due to shortages and insufficient reagents, mass testing in the EU, UK and US became problematic.
As a result, some authors have turned to test sample processing protocols, which require that samples be heated to 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing.On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates' per capita coronavirus testing rate currently exceeds that of any other country, and soon most of the population will be tested.
This was due to the ability to conduct express testing, along with the acquisition of a mass testing laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their Huo-Yan Emergency Detection Laboratories in China).
This lab, deployed in 14 days, is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the world's first large-scale lab operating outside of China.
Various testing options targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted a German version of the test kit, which is sent to low-income countries that don't have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, resulting in a lack of test kits in the US. Early in the outbreak, China and the US had problems with test kit reliability, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide the sufficient number of kits recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, experts say the widespread availability of testing has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the South Korean government has been working to provide testing facilities, mostly in private laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increased testing demand caused by the rapid spread of the virus, many private U.S. laboratories with hundreds of thousands of test samples were overwhelmed, and stocks of swabs and chemical reagents were rapidly running out.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The American test kits developed by the CDC had "defects", and for this reason the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing from being developed.
The company explained that the results may be inaccurate because of poor sampling or misuse of the kits.
The Spanish Ministry said it would recall kits that gave inaccurate results and replace them with other kits  kits from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased in China gave incorrect results. 1.2 million test kits purchased by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matović suggested dumping them in the Danube. Atesh Kara, an employee of the Turkish Ministry of Health, claimed that the test kits purchased from China had a "high error rate" and the Ministry "did not use them".
Quarantine measures for individuals whose tests tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and monitoring of people who had contact with such patients had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vauxhall, where the first death from COVID-19 in Italy occurred, conducted two rounds of testing of the entire population of about 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases of the disease were placed in quarantine.
The entrance to the settlement was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of infection.
With intensive contact tracing, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was far less intense than in other developed countries, and there were no extreme restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and shops.
Many events were canceled and on March 28, Singapore began urging residents to stay home, but schools, which ended their holidays on March 23, reopened as scheduled.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also managed the pandemic through intensive contact tracing, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but the restrictions have been less aggressive.
A statistical study found that countries that had more tests compared to the number of deaths had much lower mortality rates, probably because those countries were able to identify more patients with mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.
WHO recommends that countries without the resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 test results to one of the 16 WHO control laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Seven of these 16 control labs are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
In the following graph, the percentage of positive results in the column depends on the testing policy adopted in the country.
A country that tests only hospitalized patients will have a higher positive outcome percentage than a country that tests all citizens, regardless of whether they have symptoms of the virus, under other equal conditions.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other harmful substances.
Regular handwashing with soap at certain critical times of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are passed through feces and mouth.
A person can also catch respiratory illnesses, such as the flu or the common cold, if he touches his eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., the mucous membranes) with unwashed hands.
The five critical times of day to wash your hands with soap are before and after defecation, after washing your baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding your baby, before eating, and before and after cooking or handling raw meat, fish, and poultry.
If soap and water are not available, wash your hands with ash.
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after a patient's care.
After changing diapers or washing a child after using the toilet.
After snoring, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching animals, feed or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygienic actions associated with medical procedures.
Washing your hands before taking medication or undergoing medical procedures can help prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is especially important for people who work in the cooking or medical field, but it's also important for everyone else.
Hand washing is very good for health, for example, it minimizes the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious diarrhea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
It also reduces the rate of infant mortality in home births.
A 2013 study found that better hand washing may lead to a slight increase in growth in children under five.
In developing lands, child mortality rates from respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Regular reminders of the benefits of handwashing can reduce diarrhea by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of providing clean water to low-income regions.
The 48% reduction in diarrhea cases can be attributed to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the single most effective and low-cost way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases (ASDs) if it is developed in every home, school and other public place around the world.
Pneumonia, a major complication of RRIs, is the leading cause of death among children under five, killing about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.
The United Nations Children's Fund reports that washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet, as a regular practice, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and can reduce diarrhea deaths by almost half and acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other sanitary measures carried out under the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also prevents impetigo, a disease that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A minor negative effect of frequent hand washing is that it can cause dry skin and, consequently, damage to the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that too much hand washing can lead to itching and peeling of the skin  to a condition known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health care workers.
Too much hand washing can also be considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called critical moments during the day when handwashing with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal-oral transmission: after defecation, after washing the baby's buttocks, before feeding, before eating, and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.
Other cases where hand washing is needed to prevent transmission include before or after treating a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or sneezing, after touching animal waste or animal waste, after touching garbage.
In many countries, handwashing with soap is not common.
A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries found that, on average, 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap  is a common practice. A 2014 study found that the highest rate, 97%, was in Saudi Arabia; the US is closer to the middle of the list, with a rate of  77%; the lowest rate was in China  23%. There are now several methodologies for changing behavior and developing the habit of hand washing with soap in critical situations.
The Philippines' Department of Education's Emergency Medical Services program is an example of a large-scale initiative to improve children's health and education.
The national program is based on deworming twice a year, as well as daily handwashing with soap and daily fluoride tooth brushing.
The same program is being successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is more effective if soap or detergents are added during the washing process.
The main effect of soap and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water alone is not considered an effective skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic contaminants, are poorly soluble in water.
However, sufficient water contributes to the purification process.
Hard soap, because of its reusable nature, can also contain bacteria that can get on it after previous use.
The small number of studies on bacteria that have been exposed to the skin by a contaminated piece of soap suggests that the risk of infection is low because the bacteria are washed away with the foam.
The CDC still claims that liquid soap with a hand dispenser is the preferred option for hand washing.
Antibacterial soap is heavily promoted in health-conscious communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants selectively affects organisms that are naturally resistant to antibiotics.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
So even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selective over antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not be as advertised.
In addition to the surface active ingredient and skin protection products, complex compounds may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other respirators (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health found that simple soaps are as effective as conventional antibacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing disease and removing bacteria from the skin of the hands.
Hot water that's comfortable for human skin is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at 37 degrees Celsius.
However, to remove natural fats that keep out contaminants and bacteria, warm soapy water is more effective than cold.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water does not reduce the microbial load on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic  is a hand sanitizer that does not contain water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based hand hygiene products that do not contain water (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, antiseptic hand sanitizers, or hand sanitizers) became popular.
Most of these products are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of thickeners such as carbomers (polymers of acrylic acid) in the form of a gel, or moisturizers such as glycerin in liquid or foam form, which make them easier to use and reduce the effect of alcohol drying on the skin.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide increases the antimicrobial activity even further, and disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol are effective at killing germs.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfectants containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (logarithm of reduction 3.5 is similar to reduction by 35 decibels) on the hands after 30 seconds and 99.99%  99.999% of bacteria (logarithm of reduction 45) on the hands after 1 minute.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are practically ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.
The face and back of both palms, as well as the space between the fingers, are rubbed along the entire length for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel is completely absorbed.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that you wash your hands instead of using disinfectants, especially if your hands are heavily contaminated.
The popularity of these disinfectants is due to their ease of use and quick destruction of microorganisms, but they should not replace proper hand washing if soap and water are available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin if they do not contain softeners and/or moisturizers.
The effect of alcohol drying on the skin can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other softeners to the product.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with softening ingredients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in disinfectants are almost nonexistent.
The lower risk of irritant contact dermatitis was a factor in favor of using disinfectants over soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, water-free products do not clean your hands of organic matter, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective at preventing the spread of many pathogens as regular soap and water, because pathogens still remain on the hands when they are used.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on the ingredients and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcohol-containing products.
More recently, it has been shown that drugs containing benzalkonium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to lose its effectiveness after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin side effects.
Many people in low-income communities can't afford soap and replace it with clay or mud.
Ash or clay may be more effective than water, but they're always going to be less effective than soap.
One problem with this method is that if the clay or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it can actually increase the spread of disease.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends using ash or sand as an alternative.
To prevent infection, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends handwashing techniques that include the following steps:
Rinse your hands with warm or cold running water.
It is recommended to use running water, since standing water may be contaminated, but the temperature of the water is not important.
Wash your hands with plenty of soap, including the back of your palms, and the areas between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap (rather than just water).
Rub your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing helps remove germs from the skin, and the longer you rub your hands, the more germs are removed.
Rinse your hands thoroughly under running water.
Rinsing your hands in standing water can cause re-infection.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel or let them dry on their own.
Wet and damp hands are more likely to get contaminated, and people often overlook areas like the thumb, wrist, between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain a variety of microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use a moisturizer to prevent the skin of the hands from drying out, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are not available, there are many different low-cost ways to wash your hands: pouring water from a hanging canister or a bottle pump with holes drilled in it and/or using ash if necessary, as is the case in developing countries. In places with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions such as foot-pedal faucets and other low-cost options.
A foot-pedal faucet is a simple design consisting of a container suspended on a rope and a foot lever that must be pressed to let water pour into the hands; a piece of soap is used.
Effective hand drying  is an integral part of hand hygiene, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing body of research shows that paper towels are far more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study sponsored by the European Paper Towel Symposium was conducted by the University of Westminster in London, comparing the hygiene of paper towels, warm-air hand dryers, and more modern air-flow hand dryers.
It was found that after washing and drying hands in a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria on the finger pads increased by an average of 194 percent, and on the palms of the hands by 254 percent.
It also found that after washing and drying hands in an air-cooled dryer, the total number of bacteria on the finger pads increased by 42 percent, and on the palms by 15 percent.
After hand washing and drying with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips decreases by an average of 76 percent, and on the palms of the hands by 77 percent.
A jet air dryer, which expels air at the stated speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 mph), is capable of blowing out microorganisms from your hands and from your own unit and potentially infecting other users of the toilet and toilet in a radius of up to 2 meters.
Using a hand dryer with warm air spreads the microorganisms within a radius of 0.25 meters.
In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to evaluate various hand drying methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed depending on the method of hand drying:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are often compared to paper towels.
Hand sanitizer can be an alternative solution when travelling when soap and water are not available.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
The medical method of hand washing became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Zemmelweis discovered its high effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget to.
According to one study, the use of such devices does indeed help to reduce infection rates.
Medical hand washing lasts at least 15 seconds, using plenty of soap, water or gel to wash and wipe each part of the hands.
Hands should be carefully rubbed together, fingers crossed.
If there is dirt under your nails, you can brush it off.
Since germs can remain in the water on your hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
After drying your hands, use a paper towel when closing the faucet and, if necessary, when closing and opening any doors.
This avoids repeated hand contamination from these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in medical facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (microbes) and prevent their spread.
Hand washing remains unacceptable in most health care settings, reports the New England Journal of Medicine, with many doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus spreading germs.
One study found that proper hand washing and other basic procedures can reduce the rate of bloodstream infections associated with catheter use by 66 percent.
The draft WHO hand hygiene guidelines are also available on its website and are open for public discussion.
Whitby co-authored the review.
If compliance with the regulations is required, commercial devices can be used to measure the performance and check hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization lists five times to wash your hands:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
before using antiseptic, and
Adding antiseptic chemicals to hand washing soap (medical or antimicrobial soap) helps kill bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be needed before surgery or in an environment with high levels of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Cleaning hands before surgery requires a faucet that can be turned on and off without touching it; also use a little chlorhexidine or iodine water to rinse hands, sterile towels to dry hands after washing, a sterile rubbing brush, and another sterile tool to clean under nails.
All ornaments must be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow usually for 26 minutes.
There's no need to rub your hands for too long, like 10 minutes.
During rinsing, the water from the forearms should not fall back into the hands.
After washing, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and surgical gown is put on.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
To combat staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefits of hand washing were obtained in the first 20 percent of washing, and that very few additional benefits were obtained when hand washing frequency was increased by more than 35 percent.
Compared with washing with antibacterial soap, hand washing with regular soap leads to more than a three-fold increase in the frequency of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. A comparison of hand-rubbing with alcohol-containing solution and hand-washing with antibacterial soap, averaging 30 seconds for each procedure, showed that hand-washing with alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers in reducing the number of H1N1 influenza A viruses and Clostridium difficile spores on the hands.Measures to promote hand hygiene in healthcare settings may include hand-washing training, increased availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and written and oral reminders to staff about hand washing.
Further research is needed on the most effective measures in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective and important way to improve health and even digestion.
However, the lack of a steady water supply, soap, or handwashing equipment in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to develop the habit of regular handwashing.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every private or public toilet has a hand washing faucet, although there are cheap ways to organize hand washing in such places.
However, poor hand hygiene can also be caused by entrenched habits, not by a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and encouraging handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term changes in population behaviour.
Monitoring and evaluation of results are necessary to ensure the effectiveness of such measures.
A systematic analysis of 70 studies found that community-level sanitary and epidemiological surveillance is effective in improving hand hygiene in lower-middle income countries, whereas public marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of the United Nations Children's Fund's Three Star Approach to hand washing is promoting simple economic measures in schools that encourage students to wash their hands with soap and other hygiene requirements.
By ensuring that the minimum standards are met, schools can increase their rating from one to three stars.
Installing handwashers  is one of the possible measures implemented as part of information campaigns on hand hygiene to reduce the incidence of disease and child mortality.
Global Hand Washing Day  Another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behaviour. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund is promoting the use of emojis that symbolize hand washing.
Some studies have looked at the overall effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries compared to DALYs (saved years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that encouraging handwashing with soap is a significantly more economical solution compared to other sanitary measures.
The importance of handwashing for human health  especially for vulnerable groups of people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals  was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two innovators in the field of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, an English nurse and founder of modern patient care.
At the time, most people still believed that infections were caused by rotten odors called miasms.
In the 1980s, with outbreaks of diseases that spread through the digestive tract and healthcare-associated infections, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began to promote hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
Following the 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of handwashing with soap to protect against such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, hand washing machines in public toilets, office buildings, and airports were displayed with posters that said "The right hand washing technique".
The phrase "wash your hands" means that you don't want to take responsibility for anything or be a part of anything.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate washed his hands when deciding on the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; the phrase later gained wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to involuntarily wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse herself of an imaginary stain symbolizing a guilty conscience, in connection with crimes she herself committed and encouraged her husband to commit.
It was also found that people who remembered or observed an unethical behavior were more likely to wash their hands than others, and handwashing was more important to them.
Also, people who had the opportunity to wash their hands after seeing the scene were less likely to participate in any other cleansing or compensatory activities, such as volunteer work.
In religions, hand washing has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. Symbolic hand washing with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual provided for in many religions, including Baha'ism, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hygienic hand washing, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam mandate that people wash their hands after using the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash one's hands before and after each meal.
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19 involves the use of methods to ensure labor safety and health protection in order to control risks and fight coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper workplace risk control depends on the location and job, based on risk assessment, the severity of the epidemic situation in the community, and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) reports that low-risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and colleagues, and require basic infection control measures, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they show signs of illness, adhering to respiratory etiquette, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the workplace.
Medium-risk positions require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis, but are likely to be infected due to the ongoing spread of the disease in the community or during international travel.
This may include workers who are in contact with the public, for example in schools, high-density workplaces and some large retail stores.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using highly effective air filters, use of protective screens and affordable personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers healthcare and morgue employees who have been in contact with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 to be at high risk; the risk increases to very high when such employees perform aerosol-induced procedures or collect/process samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19.
Risk control measures appropriate for such workers include the use of safety equipment, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate for the task.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have a variety of effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to illness, need to care for others or fear of infection.
Commercial patterns can vary both in terms of the types of goods in demand and the ways in which such goods are purchased (e.g. non-peak shopping with delivery or service without leaving the car).
Finally, there may be disruptions in the delivery of goods from geographic regions affected by COVID-19.
The plans address issues of risk associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors in homes and communities, and risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic disease.
The plans also indicate the controls needed to deal with such risks, as well as emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an epidemic.
Epidemic preparedness and response plans may be based on national or state recommendations.
Some of the goals for response to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of the virus among staff, protect people at higher risk of serious health complications, support business operations and minimize negative impacts on other organizations in their supply chains.
The response is influenced by the severity of the disease in the community where the business is located.
The hierarchy of risk control measures  is a structure widely used in occupational safety and health to group such measures according to their effectiveness.
If the risk of COVID-19 is not eliminated, the most effective are engineering and technical safety measures, then  administrative measures and finally  personal protective equipment.
Safety measures are designed to isolate workers from work-related hazards and do not rely on employee behavior, which may be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in work policies or procedures that require action by the employee.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but it can help to eliminate some risks.
All types of personal protective equipment must be selected according to the hazard to the worker, fit for size (e.g. respirators), used consistently and properly, checked regularly, maintained in good condition and replaced as necessary, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of properly to avoid infection.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) believes that low-risk jobs have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic epidemic control measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay home, adherence to respiratory etiquette, including hand-covering the mouth when coughing and sneezing, provision of napkins and garbage containers, readiness for remote or shift work, if necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid using other tools and equipment, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Quick identification and isolation of people who may be infected  is a critical step to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until the fever, high fever, and many other symptoms subside for at least 24 hours without the use of fever reducers or other medications to relieve symptoms, and recommends that hospital policy be flexible, allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and ensure staff are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, moderate-risk positions require frequent and close contact within a distance of no more than six feet (1.8 m) with people who have no confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection but are likely to have SARS-CoV-2 due to community spread of the disease in the area where the business is located or recent travel to COVID-19 locations.
These categories include workers who have had contact with the public, for example in schools, high-density work environments and some large retail stores.Administrative measures for such high-risk groups and groups include advising sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual workplaces, setting schedules, not stopping the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace, increasing ventilation intensity, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic protective screens, and installing windows for customer service without leaving the car.Administrative measures for such high-risk groups and groups include recommending sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual workplaces, setting schedules with a combination of clothing, not stopping the spread of COVID-19, developing tools to provide information on the risks, including a communication forum, providing employees with the right tools to meet the needs of their clients, but we may also require training on the use of personal protective equipment, including hand-helds, personal protective equipment, and other measures to ensure that employees have access to information on COVID-19, including the use of personal protective equipment, and other less pressing issues, such as the need to provide training and information on the use of personal protective equipment, including the use of hand-helds, and protective gloves, and other tools to protect workers from COVID-19.
In rare cases, workers in this risk group may need to wear respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an aircraft, measures such as isolating the sick person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, assigning a crew member to care for the sick person, providing a mask to the sick person, or asking the sick person to cover his or her nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing are required to ensure the safety of employees and other passengers.
Secondary crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveller or when in contact with bodily fluids or potentially infected surfaces and, possibly, additional personal protective equipment if the patient has a fever, a regular cough or difficulty breathing.
In commercial shipping, including cruise liners and other passenger vessels, safety measures include postponing travel in case of illness, self-isolation, and promptly notifying the medical center on board if someone on board has a fever or other symptoms.
In the case of schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if an infected person has been in the school building, regardless of the community prevalence of the disease.
If there is minimal or moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies may be implemented, such as cancelling outings for personal meetings, gatherings, and other mass events such as exercise or choir singing, eating in cafeterias, increasing distance between desks, regulating arrival and departure times, limiting nonessential visits, and using separate health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
With significant rates of community transmission, long-term school absence may be considered in addition to social distancing strategies.For law enforcement personnel performing daily duties, the immediate health risk is considered low, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement personnel who are required to contact persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection are advised to follow the same instructions as EMTs, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during detention, workers should clean and disinfect their uniforms and equipment before re-use with household cleaning aerosols or by wiping, follow standard operating procedures for preventing the spread of disease and disposing of used personal protective equipment, and for using and washing clothing.
OSHA believes that certain categories of healthcare and morgue workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk positions include health care, support, laboratory and medical transportation personnel who are in contact with patients with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They are at very high risk of infection when performing procedures that involve aerosol formation or when collecting/processing samples from people with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Procedures that cause the formation of an aerosol include probing, coughing, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures, and invasive examination or sampling.
High-risk morgue workers include those who handle the bodies of people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at the time of their death; if such workers perform an autopsy, they are classified as at very high risk. Additional safety measures for such risk groups include the use of isolated rooms for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, including when performing procedures that involve aerosol spraying.
In some health care facilities and morgues, a special ventilation system with negative pressure may be an effective measure.
The samples should be handled with the precautions provided for biosecurity level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients be placed in segregated waiting areas based on suspected COVID-19 infection. In addition to other personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for workers who interact within 6 feet of patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for those who perform procedures involving aerosol spraying.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved facial respirators with an N95 or higher grade filter must be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program that specifies requirements for individual selection and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for the employee.The WHO does not recommend wearing special clothing because COVID-19 is a respiratory-borne disease, not a fluid-borne disease.
The WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used by screening staff at the point of admission.
WHO recommends that people who collect respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients or carriers without aerosol-induced procedures wear a surgical mask, goggles or face shield, a gown and gloves.
When performing procedures that involve the formation of an aerosol, wear an N95 or FFP2 respirator instead of a surgical mask.
Given the lack of personal protective equipment available worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such equipment by using remote medical facilities, physical barriers such as transparent windows, ensuring that only those providing immediate care can access a COVID-19 patient, using only the personal protective equipment that is necessary for the specific task, using the same respirator continuously, without removing it when working with multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment, and recommending no masks for people without symptoms.

CC0: No rights are protected
We are living in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that has shone a light on the interconnectedness of people around the world and our responsibility to one another.
We've had no precedent for these problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our efforts depends on the capacity for empathy, cooperation and development of communities around the world, which is the basis of this organization.
We've seen a friendly and caring relationship between all our colleagues, reflected in emails, calls and chats -- a wonderful testament to the fact that, fortunately, we have amazing people working with us.
I am very grateful and proud to speak of you as colleagues.
Last week I was informed of the high praise we received for our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to have access to Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for every person to have online access to this key resource.
And it's possible because of your work, whether it's keeping our sites running, paying our colleagues, or protecting our communities.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, and today it's more important than ever.
In times like these, to make a difference in the world, it's not just what we do that matters, but how we do it.
Given the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will be making important changes to our work arrangements starting next week.
Adjusting our work schedule
As Robin said earlier, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
During the conversation, we discussed our ideas on the most effective measures to take in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
The vast majority of us wanted to relieve tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to back down, so be it.
For all staff, contractors and freelancers:
We expect to work about four hours a day, or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We don't announce a weekend: if you can work normal hours for longer, that's allowed for our mission purposes.
But the world is unpredictable right now, and whatever your needs, whether it's taking care of your loved ones, buying groceries, or going to the doctor's office, your well-being is our number one priority.
We don't monitor your work hours.
If you are sick, you should not work.
It's understandable and undeniable, but we mention it.
No need to sign a sick leave or leave: just inform your supervisor and help the team revise their calendar and work schedule to ensure coverage of key areas.
(If you have a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, please let Brian from T&C Ops know so that T&C can provide support and appropriate guidance on your situation.)
The hourly rate will be paid in full.
We have already announced and reaffirmed our intention to honor our obligations to our contractors and employees with an hourly rate of pay.
Each person will be paid at the normal hourly rates that apply under normal circumstances.
This includes periods of illness when you are unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use work as a way to direct their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can produce amazing results, especially in times like these.
And again, it's about self-help.
We ask that you speak to your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some jobs are considered essential.
We should always support such activities.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising teams (among others) are doing critical work that may require additional support.
We're initiating a process for all units to assess current objectives and shift focus to providing support, which is critical to our mission.
There are many tasks for each of us, and we just focus on the most important projects.
Slowing down today doesn't mean negative consequences in the future.
We don't plan to work twice as hard to make up for lost time after the pandemic ends.
You won't have to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and timelines, where possible.
What 's happening with the APP ?
To adapt to the new reality and expectations of daily working time, we intend to adjust the timing of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We intend to propose an extension of the deadline for our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time to budget, allowing employees to prioritize critical work, self-care and caring for loved ones, while providing a shortened schedule for the next few weeks for anyone who needs or wants to work.
This extension of time limits significantly reduces the current planning burden and stress across the organization.
We'll present our proposal to the Council next week, and we'll provide representatives and teams with updates on the next steps as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for leading this effort.
Office condition, risks and cleanup
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco may have been infected with COVID-19.
However, in addition to a host of precautions, we hired a virus cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in our San Francisco office.
They used medical-grade antiviral solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the reception and elevator halls that lead to our floor.
The building has its own rules for use of safety products.
We feel the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in the District of Columbia (DC) is on the WeWork network, which has shared its COVID-19 policies with us and all staff in DC.
Last week, our office in the District of Columbia completely switched to remote work in accordance with instructions received from San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the matter of renting a building in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our longtime remote colleagues know that you can make adjustments and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that meetings be limited to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider breaking them up into a course of several days.

Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded mass events like editathons until WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We understand and communicate that our requests for such waivers and other restrictions may result in the inability to conduct coordinated grant activities, and no one will be penalized for forced delays or alterations to such objectives.
Next week we will be holding follow-up events with additional guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and community thematic conferences.
The general mood in the global community  is not only sadness about the interruption, but also some sense of relief about the understanding and the opportunity to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and beyond.
As for the prospects, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page that will provide a community space to monitor impact and communication.
We remain in touch with you regarding COVID-19
We're sending you an invitation to a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time, we'll take the opportunity to share additional information, answer your questions and spend time together, connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we're here to help in any way we can.
You can still get information from such e-mails, and other important information about COVID-19  from the Office Wiki.
CRT will update these pages, and all the information will be collected in one place.
We also work to maintain regular communication with staff in countries that have been significantly affected by the current situation.
If you have questions about travel, events, key workflows, coverage problems or need other assistance, contact the CRT.
We're ready to provide support and communication as needed.
If you have any privacy concerns, please contact Bryan Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
No such change should be seen as a renunciation of our work and our responsibilities.
Rather, it is the recognition of the possible current need for a radical re-adaptation of our work and our commitments.
We believe that these steps are necessary to support each other and to ensure that we continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and the world with the right service.
Our scheduled work will wait until the appropriate times.
Today is the time to support each other and create space for the important work ahead in the weeks and perhaps months ahead.
To make that happen, we need the help of each and every one of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourselves and your families and work as efficiently as possible when the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 counters the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), decreasing angiotensin-II content and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. AC2 also serves as a cell entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptidease domain M2 and the C-terminal transport domain of renal amino acid colectrin.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein of type I, its enzymatically active domain is found on the surface of lung and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddaze, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most alveolar cells of type II lungs, small intestinal enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of arteries of most organs.
ACE2 biosynthesis of iRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE counterweight.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into the vascular angiotensin II.
ACE2 in turn clears the carboxylic terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphin A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main cell entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Strictly speaking, binding of the S1 protein of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 splices to the enzymatic domain ACE2 on the surface of cells leads to endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into endosomes located inside cells.
This entry process also requires the serine protease TMPRSS2 carrier protein S to be primed, and its inhibition is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent. This has led some to think that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional communities and regulatory bodies recommend continuing standard therapy with ACE inhibitors and BRAS.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, the use of APH inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the control group.
Moreover, the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients receiving APF inhibitors, who were at higher risk of developing pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
Use of APH inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than in patients at general risk of pneumonia.
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be novel in the treatment of acute lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory failure syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the onset of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the exposure duration of 24 hours.
Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 may be a promising treatment for people with intolerance to classical inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated. Introduced rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 apps are mobile phone software applications designed to help with epidemiological investigation during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. to identify people (contacts) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
In some regions, a number of applications have been developed or proposed, which are officially supported by the authorities.
Several variants of contact tracking apps have been developed.
This has sparked a debate about privacy issues, especially with regard to those systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
Milder options in this regard include using Bluetooth signals to register a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would join forces to integrate the Bluetooth-based support functionality of such apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government and Alipay have launched an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have been infected with COVID-19.
It's used in over 200 cities in China, and in Singapore, there's an app called TraceTogether.
The app was developed by local IT companies, is open source and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia has launched the Bluetooth-powered StopKorona! app, which helps track contacts with potentially infected people and provides quick communication with health authorities.
The app was developed jointly by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting registration in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government said that a contact tracking app was in the final stages of development and would be available for deployment within weeks, with similar apps planned to launch in Ireland and France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering using apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia intends to use a geo-zoning app to monitor COVID-19 patients living in Moscow to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security at Cambridge University, points to a number of potential practical problems that can arise with application-based systems, including false starts and potential inefficiencies if an application is used by only a small portion of the population.
Given concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious "coronavirus" apps, Apple has limited the list of types of organizations that can offer their coronavirus-related apps on the App Store, including only "official" or other trusted organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance of the population through coronavirus-related apps; in particular, the question was raised as to whether the surveillance infrastructure created to combat the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for a limit on such surveillance.
The organizations announced eight conditions they put on state projects:
The surveillance must be lawful, necessary and proportionate;
the extension of monitoring and observation should be accompanied by reservations about limiting the term of validity;
data should be used only to combat the spread of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of the data must be protected and evidence of such protection must be provided;
Digital surveillance should exclude cases of aggravated discrimination and marginalization;
any data exchange with third parties should be defined at the level of legislation;
protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse must be guaranteed;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple are proposing a joint plan to address the problem of constant surveillance, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from the operating systems of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries use network location tracking instead of apps, which eliminates the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking has been approved.
Network solutions that have access to source location data also have large potential privacy concerns.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location data; a number of systems with privacy have been developed that use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a system was used to track contacts without using an app as a basis.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking and card transaction data, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected individuals.
The government not only used this information to warn citizens about potential contact with infected individuals, but also made location information publicly available, which was made possible by the significant changes in information protection legislation that were introduced after the MERS outbreak in that country.
Access to such information is available through a number of applications and websites, and countries, including Germany, are considering the use of both centralized and confidentiality-preserving systems.
As of 6 April 2020, details have not yet been made public.
Privacy-preserving contact tracking is an established concept with a significant amount of research literature dating back to at least 2013.As of April 7, 2020, more than ten expert groups have been working on privacy-enhancing solutions such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordinated efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy-preserving tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN), protocols to ensure privacy, mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT), and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and all matching takes place on the device.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform to ensure privacy when collecting and using location or pathway data to track the spread of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on research reported in the March 2020 paper Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform, developed by Enigma MPC, a privacy technology company that was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses robust hardware technologies that allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising the confidentiality of that data.
On April 5, 2020, a global coalition of groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols was founded, the TCN, with the goal of reducing fragmentation and ensuring global compatibility of tracking and alerting applications, which is a key factor in their widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had released the source code of BlueTrace, used in the operation of its official app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative that they claimed would ensure privacy, and which is based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography to maintain privacy.
They also published technical specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deploying tools that allow governments to create official applications to track the movement of coronavirus-infected citizens, but with data confidentiality
By integrating this feature directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to address the issue of constant surveillance by first introducing the system through operating system updates, and then removing it in the same way after the threat disappears.
Drug repositioning (also known as re-profiling, re-targeting, re-targeting or therapeutic re-targeting)  is the re-profiling of an approved medication to treat a disease or medical condition other than the disease originally intended when it was developed.
This is one of the areas of research currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research areas include developing a COVID-19 vaccine and transfusing recovering plasma.SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 drug-resistant proteins, each with several ligand-binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites provides a suitable basis for developing an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, helixase, S protein and ADF-ribophosphate.
Hussain AA and co-authors in their preclinical study studied several candidate compounds, which were then optimized and analyzed for structural similarity to the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a highly effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug that would be recommended for clinical trials.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used to treat some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and its related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs being studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin in New York State on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chlorine phosphate under an emergency use authorization (EUA).
The treatment regimen was not approved during the FDA's clinical trial process and is authorized under EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency care in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under the clinical trial regimens.
The CDC stated that the use order, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the drug when there's no other way.
A Turkish research group in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorokine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale research is being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University School of Medicine in Langon is studying the safety and efficacy of prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have shown that favipiravir is "unambiguously effective".
In 35 patients in Shenzhen who took the drug, the negative result was achieved after an average of 4 days, while in 45 patients who did not take the drug, the duration of illness was 11 days.
A study in Wuhan followed 240 patients with pneumonia, half of whom received favipiravir and the other half umifenvir.
The Italian pharmaceutical authority reminded the public that the results showing the effectiveness of the drug are scant and should not be considered definitive.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan to replenish its stockpile, and use military resources to deliver it to university hospitals where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has informed the Trump administration that the drug may be less effective in the early stages of the disease.
It may not be safe for pregnant patients or for patients trying to get pregnant.
One study of the combination of the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir (Kaletra) concluded that the effectiveness of the drugs was not established.
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.
The WHO has included a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the international trial of "Solidarity".
Remdesivir was developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Subsequently, Gilead Sciences found that remdesivir has antiviral activity in vitro against a variety of phyl, pneum, paramyx, and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are currently underway, including two conducted by the University Clinics of Cleveland; one is conducted on patients with a moderate form of the disease, and the other  on patients with a more severe form of the disease.
There are currently three clinical trials for intravenous administration of vitamin C to people who are hospitalized with a severe form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and one placebo-free trial (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, trials of the antibiotic azithromycin began in New York.

The Phase II trial, a form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, is being conducted with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria who are hospitalized with severe disease to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, included 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who had been diagnosed with COVID-19, with mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Pregnant, breastfeeding and non-effective contraceptives are not eligible for this study.
There are several coagulants being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Agency to issue guidelines for its use.
A multicenter study involving 300 patients was announced in Italy on 14 April to investigate the use of sodium enoxaparin in prophylactic and therapeutic doses.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on re-profiling approved antiviral drugs that were developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially suitable for use as COVID-19 treatments:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
See also trials in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has been clinically tested, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine are still underway.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 to be available before 18 months.
In April , five vaccine candidates underwent Phase I safety studies .
The COVID-19 virus was identified in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread around the world, leading to significant investments in vaccine development and research.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of CEPI's vaccine development initiative  are to ensure the necessary speed, production capacity, scale of deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technology platforms were in the research and development stage to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in the Phase I security studies:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (developer of stage I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, andRNA-1273)
viral vector (developer of stage I and vaccine candidate drug: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vector type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute); 37 more vaccine candidates have been announced, but little information is publicly available (presumably in the planning or development stages).
In stages I-II, preliminary testing for safety and immunogenicity is conducted, usually randomized, placebo-controlled and at multiple sites with simultaneous determination of more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group; in this phase, drugs are tested for effectiveness in preventing disease and at the same time monitored for side effects at optimal dosages.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines in active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested on humans (all are still in preclinical trials).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular pinch vaccine that genetically modifies viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.

In late March, the Canadian government announced $275 million in funding for 96 medical COVID-19 countermeasures research projects, including the development of numerous vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced a $192 million Canadian dollar allocation specifically for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as plans to create a national vaccine bank that would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine, in mice, stating that MNA administered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines, causing strong antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice] that manifested 2 weeks after immunization.
On April 16, 2020, the Canadian School of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine that may be available in the form of a nasal spray.
With bacteriophages, DNA will multiply inside human bacteria and form harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three US universities combined the resources of IBM supercomputers with the cloud computing resources of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called nonspecific effects.
This means that they may have other benefits besides disease prevention.
Another randomized study was conducted in Australia, involving 4,170 health-care workers.
The vaccines being developed may not be safe or effective.
Early studies to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models that are characteristic of COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, indicate the need for biosecurity level 3 infection containment measures when handling live viruses, as well as international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccines for SARS that are safe and effective for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and drugs to treat atypical pneumonia has been a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide.
When MERS began to spread, it was believed that the SARS study that was being conducted at the time could become the standard for developing vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that had passed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three more vaccines, all of which were virus-based vaccines and were in development, two  adenovirus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one  MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
A conspiracy theory was circulating on social media that claimed that COVID-19 was not a new virus and that a vaccine against it already existed.
Social media posts cited some patients who claimed that there were patents on the genetic sequences of other strains of coronavirus, such as SARS coronavirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus  is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), which is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include feeling tired, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from the first appearance of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases are mild, but in some cases the disease may progress to viral pneumonia and polyorgan failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and regions, with more than 153,000 deaths from the disease.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, and the virus is mainly spread through close contact, often through microscopic droplets released into the air when people cough, sneeze or talk.
Although these droplets are produced by exhalation, they are usually hazardous when they hit the ground or surface, but they are not transmitted over long distances through the air.
People also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On a surface, the virus can live for 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although its spread may be possible both before symptoms appear and in later stages.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with suspected illness and their caregivers.
The recommendations for the use of medical masks vary: some departments recommend not using them at all, some recommend using them, and others require them.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19.
Local outbreaks have been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected people may have no symptoms or flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or tightness, confusion, difficulty waking, and a bluish appearance on the face or lips. Seek medical attention immediately if you have any of these symptoms.
Symptoms of upper respiratory disease, such as sneezing, colds, or sore throats, may be less common.
Also, in different percentages, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are observed.
Some cases reported in China initially showed only a feeling of tightness in the chest and a rapid heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease may progress to pneumonia, polyorgan failure, and eventually death.
It's called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms begin to appear within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of such asymptomatic carriers in disease transmission is not yet fully understood, but preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of infection.
The percentage of infected people with asymptomatic disease outcomes is currently unknown, only being studied; however, the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations with the virus were asymptomatic.
The National Health Commission of China began including asymptomatic cases in its daily report on April 1; of the 166 cases reported that day, 130 (78%) were reported as asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva can have high concentrations of the virus.
When you speak loudly, more droplets are released into the air than when you speak at a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that when coughing in the open, droplets can spread up to 15 feet (4.5 m).
The virus is not usually transmitted through the air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that it is possible to transmit virus particles via bioaerosol, and testing of air treated by air collectors located in corridors outside people's rooms has shown the presence of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and CPR, can cause the products of the exhalation to be sprayed and thus spread the virus through the air.
There is also concern that the virus may spread through feces, however, this risk is considered low.The virus is most contagious when people show symptoms; the virus may spread before symptoms appear, but this risk is small.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one patient usually infects 23 others.
In particular, it was found that the virus can live on cardboard surfaces for one day, on plastic surfaces (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304)  up to three days, and on 99% of copper surfaces  up to 4 hours.
These rates, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents, when used properly, have a pretty beneficial effect in terms of fighting infection: they break down the fat protective layer of the virus, deactivating it in this way, and they also have the ability to remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective against the virus.
Five of the six patients had the highest virus concentration in their blood on the first test, and the sixth patient had the highest virus concentration on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  is a new severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome first detected in three people with pneumonia from the acute respiratory disease group reported in Wuhan.
All the signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective shell.
The lungs are the most vulnerable organ to COVID-19, as the virus enters host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in alveolar cells of type II lungs.
The virus connects to ACE2 and penetrates the host cell with the help of a characteristic surface glycoprotein  shipa (a ash molecule).
12% of infected people admitted to hospital in Wuhan were diagnosed with acute myocardial injury, which is more common in severe cases.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders seen as the disease progresses, but acute myocardial injury may also be due to the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in large numbers in the heart because they are involved in the functioning of this organ.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was observed in patients in IUI with COVID-19, and may indicate a poor prognosis.Autopsies of patients who died from COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar lesions (DAD) and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism to ACE2-expressing respiratory epithelial cells, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was found that pathogenic GM-CSF T cells correlate with recruitment of inflammatory monocytes that secrete IL-6 and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates were also found during the autopsy.
The WHO has also published several testing protocols for the disease.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)  is a standard test method.
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples taken with a nasal swab, but a swab sample from the nose or sputum may also be used.
The results are usually ready within a period of a few hours to two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart, and their results are not immediately relevant.
Chinese scientists have isolated a strain of the coronavirus and published its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the presence of this virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests that could detect the presence of infection at the current time, as well as the fact of possible infection in the past, were in the development stage but have not yet been widely used.
Chinese experience of studying the results of these tests has shown that their accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test, giving permission for its use later this month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital outline methods for detecting infection based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
Two-sided multi-doll subpleural focuses of compression of the matte glass type  with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution  are frequent symptoms detected in the early stages of the disease.
Subpleural dominance, a symptom of a pebble bridge (a thickening of the wall with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
There is little information available on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological examination performed during the autopsy:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, thickening and swelling of the lungs
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
mild form of pneumonia: swelling of the lungs, hyperplasia of the pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multi-nucleated giant cells
severe form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar lesion (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
In the case of a persistent pneumonia, exudate formation in the alveolar cavity and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse blood vessel-clotting (DVS syndrome); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, observing respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, or, if you don't have a tissue, covering your mouth and nose with the inside of your elbow.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended to perform a good hand hygiene procedure.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of cloth face masks in public places, in particular to limit transmission of infection by asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies are aimed at reducing contact of infected patients with large groups of people; schools and businesses have been closed, movement of citizens restricted and large public events canceled.
Distancing guidelines also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There are no drugs with proven efficacy against COVID-19. Since the development of a vaccine is not expected to be completed until 2021, most measures against the spread of COVID-19 are limited to reducing the peak of the epidemic, known as plateau.
The CDC also recommends frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or having heavily contaminated hands, and before eating and after snoring, coughing, or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends using an alcohol-containing disinfectant (alcohol content  at least 60%) for hand treatment, but only when soap and water are not available.
These compounds use ethanol or isopropanol, which have antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not a suitable agent for antiseptic hand treatment.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are shown supportive therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they have the virus wear a regular medical mask.
Extrakorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
To strengthen the immune system, it is recommended to follow personal hygiene, healthy lifestyle and diet.
Supportive therapies may be indicated for patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease.WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published guidelines for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive care physicians and pulmonologists have summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in the free resource  IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
Some health professionals recommend that paracetamol (acetaminophen) be used as a first-line treatment over ibuprofen.
When performing procedures that may involve airborne emissions, such as intubation or hand drying, precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission, especially in medical facilities.
Healthcare workers caring for people with COVID-19 are recommended to be placed in an air-drop isolation unit (AIIR)  an additional measure in addition to standard contact and air precautions.The CDC has published guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Personal protective equipment is recommended: protective gown, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves.
N95 respirators are approved for use in industrial settings, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but when used outside the prescribed range, they are not guaranteed to be effective against a specific biological agent.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends using protective face shields or, at the very least, making masks yourself at home.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require ventilation or alternative respiration, but there is a percentage of cases where it is necessary.
A type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is currently being actively studied, with some evidence to suggest that intubation can be avoided with a nasal oxygen cannula with intense airflow or two-level positive airway pressure.
It is not yet known whether either of these methods is as effective as IV for critically ill patients.
Some doctors opt for invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs if available, as this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to an intensive nasal cannula. The risk of severe disease for older people (those over 60, and especially those over 80) is much higher.
Many developed countries have a per capita hospital bed shortage, and health systems are too limited in their resources to cope with the dramatic increase in severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
In one study in China, 5 percent of patients were admitted to intensive care, 2.3 percent needed mechanical ventilation, and 1.4 percent died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in intensive care.
The challenge of providing artificial ventilation of the lungs is becoming more difficult as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that develops with COVID-19 and oxygenation are increasingly problematic.
Inhalation-supported IV and CPR are necessary to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to ensure minimal damage to the lungs by ventilation, which can lead to pneumothorax.
On earlier models of fans, high PDCV may not be available.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently in clinical trials.
The most promising drug is remdesivir.
New drug development may take until 2021, but some of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses or are in the final stages of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on patients with severe disease.
WHO-recommended volunteers are involved in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary permission for the use of recovering plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is in serious or imminent danger.
Its use has not been subjected to clinical trials, which should be conducted to prove the safety and efficacy of the treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app designed to combat the outbreak.
To log in, users must enter their name and ID number.
The app can detect close contact using surveillance data and therefore identify potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation but also sends a notification to local health authorities.Big data analytics collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people they have been in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government gave security authorities permission to monitor the mobile phone data of people who are suspected of being infected with the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus, Deutsche Telekom provided the federal state institutions of Germany and the Robert Koch Institute with aggregated data on the location of mobile subscribers.
In Russia, facial recognition technology has been introduced to identify quarantine violators.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Galera, said that mobile operators reported that 40% of people were still moving around .
The German government held a 48-hour weekend programming marathon, which attracted more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid also called for creative solutions to the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: "Increased social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic downturn are the perfect conditions to harm people's mental health and wellbeing".
The disease may be mild with few or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Patients with mild disease usually recover within two weeks, while patients with severe or critical disease may require treatment for three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 based on data on other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, although similar data on COVID-19 are not available. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia as a complication.
In people with the most severe disease course, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or polyorgan failure.
Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and heart, kidney, and liver problems.
Thromboplasty abnormalities, especially increased prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, while kidney function impairment was observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of COVID-19 patients have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were spent in the hospital.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to the ICU was seven days.
According to studies of early-stage cases, the average time from onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the male mortality rate was 2.8 percent and the female mortality rate was  1.7 percent.
Postmortem histopathological studies of lung samples indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromycoid exudates in both lungs.
There were viral cytopathic changes in the pneumocytes.
The lung looked like acute respiratory distress syndrome .
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were caused by elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89% of hospitalized patients had prior health problems.Access to medical resources and the socioeconomic situation in the region may also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality vary by condition because of such regional differences, as well as due to methodological difficulties.
Inadequate counting of cases in the mild form can lead to an exaggerated death rate.
However, the fact that deaths are caused by past-acquired diseases may mean that the current death rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 overall, and were about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
The administration of a Hong Kong clinic found that some patients who recovered from the disease had 20 to 30 percent less lung volume, and scans revealed damage.
After recovery, it can also lead to "After Intensive Care".
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether patients recovered from the virus developed a stable immune system against it.
Judging by the course of other coronaviruses, this is considered likely, but cases have also been reported where after recovery from COVID-19 coronavirus tests were still positive.
It is believed that these cases were of prolonged exacerbation of the disease, not re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural, animal-derived, and an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to its transmission from person to person.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, cites December 1, 2019 as the earliest date of the first case.
According to official data published by WHO, this date is  8 December 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary by region and time of outbreak, and are also influenced by testing volumes, quality of health systems, treatment regimens used, time since outbreak and population parameters such as age, gender and general health status.
In late 2019, WHO assigned the disease ICD-10 emergency codes: U07.1  for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2  for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of April 17, 2020, the global death rate and infection rate is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191).
This figure varies by region. Some other methods include determining the disease-related mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who died from the disease, and determining the infection-related mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases) who died from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the population from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Although not all infected patients produce antibodies, the presence of such antibodies can tell you how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castellone d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 people (1.7%) are still missing.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread during the carnival celebrations among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths could be officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health care system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, based on donated blood.
COVID-19  is the official cause of 69 deaths (0,004% of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and the death rates are different for men and women.
According to studies in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher among men.
The most at risk group  are men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women only narrows after the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of this discrepancy are unknown, but may be genetic and behavioral.
Gender differences in immunology, lower prevalence of smoking among women, and co-morbidities in men (e.g., hypertension, which occurs at a younger age in men than in women) may be the causes of higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected were men, and 72% of COVID-19 deaths were in men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not keep gender statistics on COVID-19.
Scientific studies have shown that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, have different gender statistics.
Women make up the majority of healthcare workers, especially nurses, and are therefore more likely to be infected.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease as  COVID-19.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains: CO stands for corona, VI virus, D disease, and 19  year when the outbreak was first detected: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, as required by international naming guidelines aimed at preventing stigmatization.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public communications, WHO additionally uses the terms COVID-19 virus and the virus responsible for COVID-19.
Both the disease and the virus itself are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as coronavirus and Wuhank coronavirus.
In January 2020, in accordance with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical locations in disease and virus names, WHO recommended using the terms Acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and disease.
On 11 February 2020, the official names  COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published.
Because of the limitations of standard supply chains, some digital service providers print medical materials, such as nasal swabs and parts for IVD devices.
In one such case, an Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve, and the supplier could not deliver it on time, so one of the local factories was re-designed and was able to print the necessary 100 valves overnight.
Since the first outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and false information about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the virus have spread rapidly on the Internet.
It's possible that humans can infect other animals.
The results of the study did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
There is currently no approved vaccine against the virus or medications to treat it.
Currently, various international studies of COVID-19 vaccines and medicines are being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO launched the SOLIDARITY Trial, which aims to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing compounds that are considered the most effective today.
There is no ready vaccine yet, but various organizations are actively developing candidate vaccines.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells via the ACE2 receptor, so research uses the results of previous studies on SARS-CoV.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers are working to develop a fully virulent vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether in an inactive or dead form, is aimed at inducing a rapid immune response in the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, is to create a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to specific subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies aim to destroy the S-spike protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy  is to develop vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new method of vaccine creation).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody enhancement has been identified as one of the potential problems in developing SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
The drugs approved for malaria were evaluated in seven trials, four of which were on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reprofiling of antiviral drugs accounts for the bulk of Chinese studies; by the end of April, nine Phase III studies on remdesivir had been conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for COVID-19 has been conducted. Several other existing antiviral drugs for COVID-19 are also being reviewed for the same purpose, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, there are preliminary data on the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients receiving remdesivir as an exception.
Phase III clinical trials are already underway in the US, China and Italy.The use of chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was considered in China in February 2020 and there are preliminary results.
However, there is a need for expert evaluation of the study.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but warns that doubling the dose is dangerous and can be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating COVID-19 patients. The 7th edition Chinese guidelines also list interferon, ribavirin or umifenvir as COVID-19 agents.
Preliminary evidence indicates that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitasoxanide was recommended for in vivo study, having demonstrated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Studies have shown that for SARS-CoV-2 to penetrate through interaction with the ACE2 receptor, it is necessary to reconcile the spike protein with transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2).
Studies of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further study.Ozeltamyvir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytocinemia may occur as a complication in the late stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties of hypercytocinemia.A small study by the National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in the coronavirus treatment recommendations.
The drug has entered Phase 2 of a nationwide randomized trial in Italy after positive results were obtained in patients with severe disease.
Combined with serum ferritin testing to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counteract factors that are thought to be the cause of death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by another cause, CAR T-cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine release syndrome.
Transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients recovering from COVID-19 to people who need them is currently considered a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tried in the treatment of SARS patients, but the results have been inconclusive.
Neutralization of the virus  is an expected effect by which passive antibody therapy may provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be used.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The use of recovering serum, which is made up of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies against the virus, can be expanded.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of syndromes with a high degree of similarity
Li Wenlian, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later became infected and died of COVID-19 after reporting the spread of the virus.
