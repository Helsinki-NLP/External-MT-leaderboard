The old chapel is cursed.
It begins to come into our minds that we cannot ignore nature.
Today is warmer than yesterday.
It is worth citing one famous passage of his essay.
He writes on his forehead.
It is written on his face.
Somehow it seems wrong.
I just don’t feel safe about it.
It sounds boring.
It happens constantly.

I was a passenger.
I was home then.
I was home yesterday.
I was in the theatre.
I was beautiful.
I was beautiful.
I was born in 1980.
I was calm until I saw the syringe.

I made a cake.
I did not ask you.
I didn’t know that Tom did it.
I did not count it.
I was not here.
I wasn’t even in Boston the night when Tom was killed.

Unfortunately I met her.
I had enough money to buy such a house.
Even if I didn’t do that.
I’t marry Tom.
It is a pity that I did not ride a bike here.
If only I had enough willpower to keep a diet.
As long as I understood.
I want to be next to you.
I want to learn.
I wish he had more time for me.
