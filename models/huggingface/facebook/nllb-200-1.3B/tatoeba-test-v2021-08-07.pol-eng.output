I got up slowly.
I'm a student at the university.
I'm studying math as hard as I am learning English.
I got it on the first approach.
I did it. I did it.

I propose to reschedule the meeting.
I suggest we wait another hour.
I'm all for that.
I think you love her.
I'm really thirsty.
I suspect Tom cheated on the test.
Is your mother home?
Is your computer working well?

In the summer, I always take a bath in the morning.
I spoke to her on the phone.
It all happened so fast, I can't explain it.

Italy is in Europe.
That surprised me.
I'm very pleased.
You can do it in one day.

It cost me a lot of money.
It could be cancer.
Maybe that's true.
It could have happened to anyone.
That's up to you.
It didn't take long.
It didn't make any sense.
It doesn't always work.
It's not about you.
It's none of your business.
It doesn't matter where it came from.
It doesn't look so bad.
It doesn't work like that.

It's unlikely any store would sell this model at that price.
I don't think it's likely that this situation will ever happen again.
I don't think the new Windows version is coming out this month.
I think it's unlikely that Tom would come to the party alone.

It's already eleven.
It's a matter of life and death.
And what's amazing is that the Iranians, who were forced into Islam by the Arabs through military conquest, became the most violent followers of Islam -- they went so far as to persecute the followers of Zoroastrianism, even though it was their ancestral religion -- something like the Stockholm Syndrome nationwide.
It's against reason.

It's snowing.
I'm surprised he hasn't come.
It's their only choice.
It's too expensive.
It's too hot for me.
It's true he's young, but it makes a lot of sense.
That's right, he's a good golfer.
He's young, but he's smart.
It's very hard to talk about what happened.
It's warm.
It's a windy day, isn't it?
It's windy today.

It might rain this afternoon.
