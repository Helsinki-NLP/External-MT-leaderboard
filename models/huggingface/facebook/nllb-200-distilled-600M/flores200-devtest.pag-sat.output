Why does an organization want to establish a long-term learning organization? The purpose of this concept of organizational learning is to create practice.
When the resources in each department of the organization are used effectively, creativity and ingenuity are developed.
As a result, collective efforts to overcome the challenge will lead to a new invention to serve the needs of the customer.

Angel (2006) explains that the Continuum approach is the method used to help organizations achieve high levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provided physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. This narrowed the research area and became more accurate.
Researchers support the connection between brain pathology and behavior.

Although many consider AI to be science fiction, there is a major branch of computer science that is concerned with making machines with human-like traits and abilities.
Research on AI includes the development of a machine that can perform tasks that require human intelligence.
This includes control, planning, and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer requests and questions, and the ability to reflect on penmanship, voice, and facial expressions.

Blogging can also "increase student interest in the local community". Blogging can help students to become more intelligent and engage in their subject matter. (Toto, 2004).
Blogging also encourages collaboration, and this helps students to learn more than just schoolwork.
Blogging appropriately "encourages students to think and explore more; when they comment on what they read on the Internet, they express their opinions on other people's writings and express their views on a particular topic". (Oravec, 2002).
