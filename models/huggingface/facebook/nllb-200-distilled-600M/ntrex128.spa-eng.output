Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM) are concerned about looking like muppets
Some Members of the Assembly are baffled by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Parliament of Wales (MWP).
This confusion arises from the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A Labour Party Assembly Member stated that his group was concerned that he was rimming with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
A Member of the Welsh Party Assembly commented that his whole group was "discontent" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales claimed that his group was open to name change, but noted that the pronunciation jump from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, states: Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the Assembly Members will be the matter of the members themselves.
The 2017 Welsh Government Act granted the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals which revealed broad support for the Welsh Parliament to be summoned to the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Parliament of Wales (or WMP), but the MWP option gained the majority of support in a public consultation.
Apparently, the Members of the Assembly are suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could bring the Speaker of the Assembly, Elin Jones, to the fore, who should submit the bill on the changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Assembly Members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the final say on what they should be called when they deliberate on legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether their country's name will change to Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-old conflict with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership bid.
Macedonia's President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change referendum, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's keep silent because of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
Historically, the older people I've spoken to say there was a bar and a church on every corner, Mr. Adams comments.
Today, there is neither one nor the other.
He pointed out that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
Now people socialize in a different way, he says.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of neighborhoods where neighbors regularly go.
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of goods will not last as long as leaders expect and that sooner or later, they will return to their starting point.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the kind of people who won't help the shrines left in the neighborhood.
The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people, he said,and therefore will speed up the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will end up being members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930's.
A black congregation that was worshiping nearby acquired the building.
A black congregation took over St. Martin's, under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire severely damaged the building and, while Father Johnson's parishioners were making plans for its rebuilding, they also commissioned the carriage.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson at St. Martin, proudly called it the "Poverty Campaigns".
In July, the expert who played the carillon called: a cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, noted that it was the world's first carillon used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left to play the larger Riverside Church carillon 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on their concern that the diocese would "try to pass the costs" to the board, although it had not participated in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark wounds 13-year-old boy who was diving in search of lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving in search of lobsters in California on the opening day of lobster season, authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he had been scuba diving with friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help, so he approached with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited about catching a lobster, but then he realized he was screaming that he had been bitten.
I 'm sorry .
He had a broken collarbone, Hammel observed as he approached the child.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark", Hammel added.
The child was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue man Captain Larry Giles commented at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities shut down access to the beach, from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami Beach, in Encinitas, for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans drive the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many staff specialised in the hallways of its style and beauty establishments.
To significantly boost the UK beauty market, valued at £2 800 billion and growing at a rate of increasing relative to falling fashion and household sales, the largest beauty halls will be tested at 11 stores across the country and, if successful, more stores will do the same next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time as this supermarket chain is looking for ways to use the shelf space that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and household chores.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its beauty offering with up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique make-up line with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly in demand by younger customers.
The fragrance shop will also test its concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first recently opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to buying small amounts of food daily in local stores force supermarkets to work hard to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, has said stores will increasingly resemble shopping malls as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discount establishments Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount outlets into hundreds of stores and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion about how to split revenue from pharmaceutical outlets in its supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale of the 281 pharmaceutical establishments in Sainsbury to Celesio, the company that owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will be involved in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Chief Commercial Officer, commented: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty halls to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in a specialist staff who will be available to provide advice.
Our brand offerings are designed to suit all needs, and an attractive environment and convenient location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of buying.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby breaks an £11m deal.
Peter Jones, the Dragons Den star, left furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby broke an £11 million deal with her lifestyle business line to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to devote to the Truly fashion and accessories brand.
This business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced she was quitting the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Dragons Den star Peter Jones by leaving his lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources, Jones was "furious" when the television golden girl admitted that her new deals, valued at up to £1.5 million, did not leave time to devote to Truly, her fashion brand and accessories, during a tense meeting held Tuesday at her business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was profiled as a favourite to double Willoughby's fortune, of about £11 million.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was quitting the business, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his vacation homes.
As one source commented: Truly was, by contrast, Holly's top priority.
It was going to be her long-term future, which would hold her for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved completely stunned.
No one could believe what happened Tuesday, so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow's headquarters, ready to go for sale.
Experts believe the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly delaying its launch even further.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are the parents of three children and have for the past ten years maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples were vacationing together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV show I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones claimed that last night there was no business discussion.
A difficult conversation and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he gets from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump commented in his mocking voice as a news anchor.
I haven't given up on anything.
He noted that Kim is interested in meeting him again after Trump commended the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an adequate US response to North Korea's first steps toward disarmament.
On the contrary, he noted, the US continues to apply sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump's perspective was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his rally.
"We're getting along great with North Korea", he said.
We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a fantastic relationship now.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: an end to missile tests, help to free hostages and bring the remains of American soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when discussing relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but then instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded stadium, we'd have about 200 people right here", Trump said, pointing to the people right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were informed that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had to be displaced, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not seek international assistance, which complicates matters a bit, Ms Sumbung explains.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to send to Palu, they are still unsure whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national emergency agency, explained that authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide assistance.
Considering that the earth is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country remains incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not seen as many in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even though there was a previous warning, likely contributed to the loss of life.
At best, traveling from one island in Indonesia to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate logistics even more.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to attend to earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new catastrophe enclave.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure the central focus of his election campaign, and has allocated a lot of money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected Mr Joko's administration, which faces re-election next year.
In addition, it must cope with the pressure of persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool, equals the score against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 metres from Chelsea's goalkeeper when the score was 1-0.
He put the ball on his left foot with a touch before throwing it to the second stick.
The action drove it over the area and headed towards the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop him with a jump and fell into the net.
"I was trying to get in that position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play very early, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching and I touched him.
Chelsea were 1-0 ahead in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues midfielder gave a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning making a regatta near the midfield and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran out in the middle of the field.
Then he made a nice walk into space that took Hazard to the area.
Hazard stood in front of the defense and finished throwing the ball into the second pole net with a left foot kick that Liverpool's Alisson Becker couldn't stop.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's emergency services said early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the debris of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and sparked waves of up to six meters, according to the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with ruined buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 p.m. with stab wounds in Grayson Mews, John Street, which resulted in the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect.
Police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard anything to go to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I would encourage anyone who was near Jonh Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also recommend anyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have picked up something on dashcam contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some people who think they know the woman came to the scene of the crime to find out where they found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to re-enter his apartment, but the police tell him no one can enter or leave the building.
He was perplexed when he found out what had happened.
Now, residents are being informed that they will be allowed back in within hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
He keeps saying it's terrible.
By 2:00 p.m., there were two police vans inside the cord and one outside.
Several agents were standing inside the cord controlling the block of flats.
Anyone with information is requested to email DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, registration 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the last memorial success for re-writing history
Their ban would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England carried out by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as a "crazy" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that removing the figure of Oliver Cromwell from the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell was sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more late in the 19th century than he is today, a defender of parliament under external pressure, in this case, of course, the monarchy.
If this is a fully accurate description, it is a question of continuing the historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A murderous pig attacks a Chinese ranch
A pig attacked and killed a rancher at a market in southwestern China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a well at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer is preparing to inject pigs from a pigsty in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently, he traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door of a nearby well open.
He said there was a big pig in the gutter with blood in his mouth.
Forensic examination confirmed that the nearly 250-pound pig had attacked the rancher to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and shattered", the cousin, who goes by his last name, Wu, told The Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
It seems Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they're rare, it's not the first time a pig attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 200-pound pig ran over a rancher in his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After pigs ate a ranch in Oregon in 2012, a rancher in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "shooter".
They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
The only thing to do is to have proper respect for them, he said.
The wreckage of Hurricane Rosa will leave heavy rainfall widespread in the southwestern United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa caused wind gusts of more than 136 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, from Sunday to five a.m. (Eastern time) and was located nearly 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, low pressures are beginning to be generated in the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to push the intense tropical rain to the north, southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain hits the approaching low pressure, there will be heavy, widespread rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flows and possible desertification.
Heavy tropical rainfall will cause rainfall of nearly 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Because of the scattered nature of tropical rainfall, sudden flooding with conditions that quickly worsen is possible.
Because of the threat of torrential rain, it is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into swampy rivers and storms will cause scattered winds and dust clouds locally.
The approaching low pressures will leave heavy rains in specific parts of the southern California coast.
Torrential rains may leave up to two inches [about two centimeters] of water, which could cause small debris flows and cause roads to slip.
It would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical sparrows will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before rainfall spreads late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes in the United States will be observed due to cooling of the Arctic and warming of the tropics.
Sometimes this involves drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen across the central United States on Sunday.
There will be a nearly 7 degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to recover and expand again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, a warm start to October is expected, with widespread temperatures ranging from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast to around 26 degrees.
On Tuesday, temperatures in New York could reach as high as 26 degrees, about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high probabilities of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh appear
More than 20 million people followed the heartbreaking testimony that Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly occurred in the 1980s, gave on six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, politics remained at a standstill and the media interrupted its usual programming to broadcast the latest news Friday: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh touched her while intoxicated and that he tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that hadn't happened.
It's likely that more than 20.4 million people who commented on Nielsen on Friday have seen it.
The company accounted for the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has some trouble calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience similar to that of a playoff or Oscar game.
Fox News Channel, whose Tertulian members have strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, fuels the leading channel, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a day-long appearance, Nielsen noted.
ABC took second place, with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen commented.
After the appearance, there was still great interest.
Flake was the central character in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning caught protesters shouting at him as he tried to climb an elevator to attend a hearing before the Judicial Committee.
While receiving these reproaches, broadcast live on CNN, he was shown down.
"Looking at my face", said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
And she went on, "You have power when there are so many women who don't have it".
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, that he would tell more things in his appearance before the Commission.
Cable and broadcast networks broadcast it all live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to propose Kavanaugh's Senate candidacy for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate over the next week, which some Democrats had been asking for.
Flake was convinced, in part by conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was critical, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'making politics' with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "making politics" about Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress to be held in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside his own on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on Chequers' alleged plan for Brexit, claiming that a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's tariffs was "totally absurd".
Wayde Murder: Dyteon Simpson arrested by police as suspect in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on a second-degree murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police say he admitted to shooting Wayde.
A $350,000 bail has been set, according to the defense.
The Baton Rouge Eastern District Court issued a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the Louisiana State Police fugitive unit, the State Police forensics lab, Southern University police and citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's athletic director, thanked the area's police for their diligence and pursuit of justice.
Sims was 20.
The player, who was over two meters tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in one game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade stated that his team is "devastated" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
"These are the things people always worry about", Wade said.
A volcano throws ash in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighborhoods south of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center recorded several tremors and tremors.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists ahead of the independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested Saturday in Barcelona after independence-seeking protesters faced anti-riots as thousands of people took part in opposition demonstrations coinciding with the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarized secession referendum.
A group of hooded separatists who had been cut off by riot control threw eggs and powdered paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Clashes also occurred in later hours and police used stakes to contain the fight.
For several hours, the independence groups, with messages like ni olvidado ni perdón, confronted unionist protesters with the cry of Viva España.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries suffered during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in the region a year after the vote on 1 October, which Madrid considered illegal but held by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly elected independence, although turnout was low, as people who were against secession largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to block voting at polling stations across the region, where violent clashes took place.
The pro-independence groups camped out Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support for the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would become independent.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote, but now we are stuck, he said.
Despite achieving a vital, though narrow, victory in the regional elections last December, pro-Catalist parties have struggled to hold on to momentum this year, as many of their best-known leaders, whether in self-imposed exile or detention, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been stirred up by politicians on both sides.
It's getting more and more tense, he declared.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced he would participate in next year's European Parliament elections.
Being a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish Government, he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for raiding a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly raiding a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident occurred Thursday at about 7:30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that damage was done to the accesses and the building itself.
At some point, he may have shot the car with a racket.
A Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win.
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers by scoring the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference, and Gary Holt's team took a place, with Hibernian in second place.
This season, Gerrard's have yet to win any out of the house and next Sunday they face the Hearts, the leader of the table with eight points of advantage.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston extends their streak of division wins to six games.
Livingston lets opportunities pass in front of a forceful visitor
Holt's team should have gone one step ahead long before scoring, causing all sorts of trouble to the Rangers for their straight play.
Scott Robinson outperformed the defense, but failed his goalkeeper attempt, and Alan Lithgow was then shot by a stray after interning to finish Craig Halkett's head centre in front of goal.
The host team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause trouble to the visitors with the balls in play.
That's how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers granted them a free throw and Livingston sought an inning, with a combined play by Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated the possession, but they couldn't pass the host defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was pretty calm.
That game continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced a stop on Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor rejected a shot from Scott Pittman with a single kick, and Lithgow was left out of another play by Livingston.
Two penalty requests were denied, one after Halkett's entry on substitute Glenn Middleton and one by one hand.
The following is a list of the most common uses of the term 'symmetrical' in the United Kingdom:
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for the Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to exceed expectations of an upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have barely undergone changes since his ascent, but this is largely due to Holt for the way he has reinforced the team since his arrival.
I counted on a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the team captain, was huge and led a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had some very good times with Gerrard, they were short.
They failed to materialize the plays, as they only managed to get into the opposing field once, which is a wake-up call to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at re-establishing relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan headed to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers flocked to the vicinity to see its president.
Hundreds of Erdogan's opponents, many of them Kurds, were also heard condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
These demonstrations reflect the divisiveness of this visitor, who was received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after colliding with vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy Deptford highway, southeast of the city, at about 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by paramedics, but died there.
The accident comes after another cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that fled on Childers Street, nearly two kilometers from the scene of Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said the agents were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut off and buses have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured after riots
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation at a high-security prison for men, according to the prison's directorate.
The riots began at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and continue.
Specialists from an elite team (called Tornado) are in charge of controlling the altercations, which involve eight internals and affect a pavilion.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specialist prison staff have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have received medical care for injuries.
Violence in our prisons is not tolerated and we made it clear that those responsible will be put in the hands of the police and could spend more time behind bars.
Long Lartin prison houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after a prisoner attacked him.
In addition, in October last year, riot police officers were asked to come to the prison to deal with a serious altercation in which prison staff were attacked with billiards balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (arid areas could benefit)
It's unusual for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what could happen early next week when the last harvests of the Rose hurricane cross the southwest of the desert, with the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain at the end of Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service commented in a tweet that only 10 hurricanes had maintained their state of tropical storm or depression in a 321-kilometer radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached nearly 40 miles [65 km] from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rainfall, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogollon Escarpment in Arizona.
Rainfall is likely to fall between 2 and 5 centimeters, possibly reaching 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the southwest desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of sudden flooding, the rainfall of Rosa can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious matter, some of this torrential rainfall is likely to be beneficial because of the drought conditions that are currently being experienced in the southwest.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is suffering, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, the itinerary of Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which will still have a hurricane force on Sunday morning with maximum gusting winds of 136 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding cooler waters in the Pacific, so it's losing strength.
So, it's expected to hit Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm throughout Monday afternoon.
Heavy torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
Torrental rainfall of between 7 and 15 centimeters is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a possible 25 centimeters, as reported on weather.com.
After that, Rosa will head north from Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then traveling through Arizona south to Utah late Tuesday night.
The main danger to Rosa or her remains is heavy torrential rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern U.S. desert, notes the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous sudden flooding and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after another 16-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The teen was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Avon, according to Somerset Police.
The agents have made a call to anyone who may have recorded what happened on the cell phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh suffered the misery and anger of the Democratic Party
Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the Democratic Party's ruthless and outrageous tactics, Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered the misery and anger of the Democratic Party throughout the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that she had been sexually assaulted decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, the Americans saw Kavanaugh's cunning, quality and bravery.
"Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most accomplished legalists of our time, a lawyer with an admirable record in public service", he told his West Virginia supporters.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh's candidacy when he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
Five weeks to go for one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't introduce myself, but it is a race, he said.
That's why I go from place to place fighting to get great candidates.
Trump claimed the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be held no later than Friday, a senior Republican Party official told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number rising
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the huge waves that ravaged beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach in Palu city on Friday when waves of up to six meters reached the coast at dusk, dragging many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When a tsunami was detected yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were victims, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB) told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it ravaged everything on land", Nugroho said.
He also added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) reported in a statement that the energy released by the great earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "important" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, and 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be higher along the 300 km of coastline north of Palu, a zone called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were completely paralyzed and there was no information about Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300 000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse", he said.
On Saturday, the agency received much criticism for not reporting a tsunami had struck Palu, although officials say the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a video captured by a fan and shared on social media, you can hear a man standing on the top floor of a building warning people on the street that a tsunami is coming.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, leading past buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately validate the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but the evacuated people still need food and other basic goods.
The city's airport has reopened for emergency services only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul's evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although the staff of World Vision from Donggala have arrived safely in Palu, where employees take refuge under a shroud installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating landscape on their way, Mr Doseba said.
"They told me they had seen many houses destroyed", he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even as aid groups were putting disaster relief gear in place, some people complained that experienced cooperators were not being allowed to move to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, funding, supplies and provision of foreign personnel can only be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
It is still a provincial catastrophe, said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
As soon as the Government says it considers it a national disaster, we can start providing international aid, but it has not yet happened
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the people still missing still had hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the heartbreaking stories that write natural disasters.
A little boy was pulled out of a sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, instructor of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped at the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"Because of my experience in the parapet field, I carry my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the parapente community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the competitors from Palu, who were participating in the festival that was being held on the beach.
However, their messages only showed one verification mark in gray, not two in blue.
"I think that means the messages didn't get delivered", he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during a charge at an ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, robbers grabbed a Brink employee who was charging an ATM in Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM located in the recreation center and was preparing to recharge it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man ran up behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money intended for recharging.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects leaving the scene, but police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will start calling himself Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: The person formerly known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time, a name he used as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to present her new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for emotional reasons, as the show's creator commented.
Besides being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had religious significance to him.
I think it's the most used word in the Bible, where it means you, West commented earlier this year as he talked about the album title with radio host Big Boy.
It's you, it's us, it means us.
It went from being Kanye, which means "the one", to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confused things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He's one of the many famous rappers who's changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in uppercase or lowercase, with or without a script.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the military against civilians
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, elected Mexican president, has vowed never to use the military against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that he would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico.
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were consolidating throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by giving them monthly subsidies to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He claimed that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to become involved in criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for AI.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments follow announcements regarding AI from various parts of the US Government, even when, in general, the US lacks an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to become the No. 1 innovation in AI by 2030.
Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US. We are looking forward to the next breakthrough in AI, says Lee.
The double funding means the double chance that the next big breakthrough in AI will be achieved in the U.S., as Lee stated in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton publisher Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most important AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the best American player at Othello.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
It's not China that's taking academic leaders; it's corporations, Lee noted.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired prominent people from universities to work in AI.
Lee commented that changes to immigration policy could also help the U.S. step up its AI initiatives.
I think doctors in I.A. should have permanent residence cards automatically, he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China funds people from academic institutions just like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to attract partners from the industrial and academic fields.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in I.A. research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that tried to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action in months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum whether to change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum held on Sunday whether their name would be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which had blocked its candidacy for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, mostly in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has questioned whether participation will reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum ballot asked the following question: 'Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the agreement with Greece being accepted?'
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price to pay for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the breakup of Yugoslavia, to try to gain access to bodies like the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the European Union, because this means a safer life for all", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopie.
Although it will not be legally binding, several Members of Parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote so that it is decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that, at one o'clock in the afternoon, no irregularities had been reported.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopie.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko deposited their vote in the Macedonian referendum on a name change that would open the way for NATO and the European Union to join in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopie, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was setting up a small stage and taking out chairs in front of tents planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of entering NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads high, not through the back door", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us to come in like Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, like China and Russia, and be part of Eurasian integration
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is over 20%.
I think the vast majority will be in favour, as over 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO, Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive outcome would be a "confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is less than required.
Another poll by Macedonia's Telma TV revealed that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since he came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City, dodges all of Brighton's defence to score a goal.
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defence in the 2-0 win that Manchester City won on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester (England).
For Aguero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine midfielder received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the play.
He ran between three defenses at Brighton before entering the open field.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He skipped one defence before overtaking several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
He took a left-hand pass, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who hit him with his right foot to avoid goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the net.
Agüero has some foot problems, City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment.
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League competition.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that move, Aguero received the ball well within the territory of Brighton.
He made a nice left-sided pass for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him a few touches before directing Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues forward threw the ball into the net just before he went out of bounds.
City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to spill the party to the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there was no reason to force another opening.
Still, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to step on the mound Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if these, triumphed over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West Division, still have playoff chances.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard spot thanks to a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still chasing their first division title.
Even if we don't play anything, at least we can step on the rubber with the certainty that the Denver public will be excited and that the other team will probably play at the highest level I've ever faced this year.
Why wouldn't you want to participate?
The Nationals still have to announce an opening for Sunday, but it looks like they're inclined to let Scherzer pitch in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, had a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander's record is 18 wins and 7 losses, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 innings.
Trump gives a rally in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, when he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
In November everything we have done is at stake.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It is one of the most important. I do not present myself, but it is a race, so I go from place to place fighting to get great candidates, he said.
And he went on: "We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all means necessary, you see the meanness, the evil.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to go over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control.
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission of resistance and obstruction.
"We've seen it for the last four days", he said, saying the Democrats were furious, they were bad, they were horrible and they were fake.
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee nominating Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received public booze.
Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no, I'm hoping for an answer.
The Labour Party already has a wide range of views.
He's intolerant of people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was barely surprised.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour MPs who are told they are not welcome, and only for saying what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated as if she were categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I disagreed with the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, on Europe, which is ironically issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
As stated in the notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday, we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of the eight years I have been a Member of Parliament for the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a policy of 'more kindness and kindness' is now more than forgotten, if it was actually implemented at any time.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissenting opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on whether party leaders consider it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he once thought he shared a similar political vision began to expect him to radically change his mind and adopt positions he would never have agreed with, whether it was on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly, regardless of what I say, there is a diatribe of insults on social media demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me I should not be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who's had it.
Indeed, I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn claimed that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with every motion of censure or change in the selection rules, the party gets tighter.
Over the last two years, I've received a lot of advice that I should keep my head down and not get so loud and that would be okay.
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a high school student, motivated by the Thatcher government's negligence that left my comprehensive school classroom literally in ruins, I have tried to support improving public services for those who need them most, whether as a councillor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my political ideas, not even in the last election.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to be unaware of my political positions or areas where I disagreed with current leaders.
All I would say to those who pushed Friday's motion is that I don't understand this desire to waste time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader when the country heads to a Brexit that will affect households, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for voters, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will prevent me from acting as I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
Two trials at the end of the match may have decided to some extent the final result, but, no doubt, Ayr deserved the win in this very entertaining Tennents Premiership match.
Now they're at the top of the table and the only undefeated team out of the ten that are participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to better seize the opportunities, that gave the victory to the local team, so coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We have been tested in all matches and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he declared.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, commented: "The Ayr deserves recognition, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute test, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loaned to the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this draw from the opponent and Jason Baggot got an unconverted test.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty. Earlier, just in halftime, he scored and converted a solo test, which left the score at 17-5 in favour of Ayr at rest.
However, the Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, narrowed this gap to five points.
There was then a long interruption due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had to be removed on the stretcher, and, as the match resumed, Ayr took the lead with a trial by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, allowed the Melrose to re-take advantage of having another man with an unconverted essay from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for placing Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson did a rehearsal when he was at the back of the forward moul.
Climo converted him, as he had been doing almost since the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball sent by David Armstrong from a kick and sent wingman Gregor Henry to the back to do the fifth practice of the locals.
The protagonist of Still Game wants to orient his career towards the restaurant sector
Ford Kieran, the protagonist of Still Game, seems determined to move into the restaurant sector after revealing he has been appointed director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis on the famous BBC show, which he writes and co-stars with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the series' final, and it looks like Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although a source in the Scottish Sun noted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's booming restaurant market.
The sea belongs to us: a landlocked Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors are guarding a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, blue flags are waving.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the motto:
It's a duty to recover it.
In all of Bolivia, a land without sea, they still vividly remember the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict that took place in the 19th century, as well as the longing to sail again through the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia expects an International Court of Justice decision by October 1, after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision, commented Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice's ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is fighting a controversial re-election battle next year, also has much to say about Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's decision comes only six months after the final allegations indicates that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Far from promoting Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have stunted it.
The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration, Zárate said.
In addition, he suggested that Morales' belligerent rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decisions should be unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile and the possibility of ending 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits, he said.
Also, Calzadilla denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the US.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korean foreign minister, says his nation will never be the first to end nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to deliver on the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming a halted nuclear-related diplomatic talks more than three months after this summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that the continuation of continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War to subdue the North is a "camera".
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration without Pyongyang first making any significant disarmament move.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold another summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang's seriousness in giving up an arsenal that the country probably regards as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the leaders.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of huge hats that are about to land on a shopping street near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a set of eccentric, large-sized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection on the runway, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the runway.
Valentino's most notable piece was a beige hat with a wide wing adorned with feathers that enveloped the models' heads.
Other large accessories were jewelry-drinking watermelons, a witch's hat, and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and reminded more of Hannibal Lecter than the high-heeled one.
One creation resembled a complete diving kit, snorkel and glasses included, while another looked like a melted ice cone.
If you like big-size fashion, you're in luck.
Style hunters predict that huge hats could start to show up on the streets of the shops.
The big hats come stepping on the hand of La Bomba, with a straw hat with a wing of over 60 centimeters worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this unpractical hat that flooded social media presented another great creation on the runway: a straw beach bag as big as the model in the bathtub that wore it.
The dark orange rafia bag, decorated with rafia stripes and with a white leather saddle, was the main piece of Jacquemus's La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at Paris Fashion Week.
As famous fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer, I hope to see huge hats and beach bags on shopping streets.
John Edward: Language skills are fundamental to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results in exams that is reinforced by individual and collective successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further education, for their chosen career and for their place as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, modern languages remain a popular and desirable subject in schools.
As Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message reaches his head.
If you speak to him in his language, it reaches his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that if you want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you cannot rely solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages got an A, the highest grade.
Data from the 74 centres that are part of the SCIS showed that 72% of students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as they consider them a fundamental competence that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages are considered to be at the same level as the CTIM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in the curricula of independent schools and everywhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission revealed that 17% of the reasons given by employers for the difficulties they encountered in filling jobs were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
The potential for job opportunities that require languages are increasing, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last a lifetime.
The fact that they can communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow that person to automatically outperform the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% of them spoke no foreign language well enough to have a conversation.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for today's children.
If children know several languages, especially those of developing economies, they will be equipped to have better opportunities to find quality employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the UK towards 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child's interests, in independent schools you can always choose between several languages taught by specialist teachers.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equipps them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
At present, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to have vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must be considered competencies for international communication.
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's got to be done right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges
LeBron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The fan's wait to see LeBron James debut in his first game against the Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, has announced that James will play the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
It will be more than one and less than 48, Walton commented on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season matches to prepare myself", he declared.
Trump rally time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including stops in supportive places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his candidate's confirmation vote to fill the Supreme Court vacancy pending, Trump is seeking support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch it online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's appearances by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who were strained over allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and have been waiting for an early Senate confirmation vote for at least a week while the FBI investigates them.
However, the main goal of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans facing the November elections take the lead.
President Trump's campaign said the five rallies next week aim to "encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we go into the campaign", a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to give his name told Reuters.
Scheduled at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena, tonight's rally could attract sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as have media coverage in Pittsburgh, as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"For Morrisey, it's not a good sign that the president has to come and give him a push in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows that they dare to fight to keep hope alive in the face of Sunday's individual matches.
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging thrust pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, even more so in competitions like this.
So where would you say the momentum is now?
"We were leading by six points and now we are leading by four, so I guess that can be considered a small boost", Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel they have some wind in their favor and ample reason to be excited, among other reasons for the Spieth and Justin Thomas pair, who played together all day and scored three points out of four each.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and preaches by example.
The celebration guttural screams increased in volume as his round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth game as he and Thomas went down two holes at a time.
The putt that gave them the game on the 15th was met with a similar scream, from those broadcasting that he believes the American team has not yet been left out.
What needs to be done is to redouble efforts and concentrate on the game, Spieth commented.
That's what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange, adorable couple from Europe is four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
Moliwood was the only couple who didn't do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That streak and the way it flows its energy with the buzzing public makes it clear that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in different holes.
It is still too early to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning four balls, after forming a couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole they couldn't get out of.
But there won't be any help getting out of the holes on Sunday.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to watch up close because they appreciate the interactions between couples, the tips they give and the tips they don't, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead on the last day, but this foursome session also showed that the U.S. team dares to fight, something that some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 result over the United States.
The motivated duo composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two victories over a Tiger Woods who saw himself in trouble, advancing four points in the Le Golf National qualifying.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two games, but failed to shorten distances.
American Jim Furyk needs to score eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, and he and Molinari, who received the nickname Molliwood after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to score four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent union served to defeat a discouraged Woods and rookie American Bryson Decahmbeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who in Saturday's two games hadn't stood out too much, had occasional moments of brilliance, but now has lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the morning fourballs, was again Henrik Stenson's partner in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, world number one and number three respectively, by a score of 2-1.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in the southwest of Paris, Europe did not have everything on its side.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a benchmark for the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They achieved an exciting 2-1 victory over Ian Poulter and Spaniard Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the opening two holes.
In Ryder Cup history, a team recovering from a four-point gap in individual matches has only happened twice, although Furyk, as the trophy holder, only needs a draw to keep it.
Although they've been the second best for two days, it seems like carrying out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond your capabilities.
North Korea says there's no chance they'll disarm unilaterally first if they don't have confidence
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and that there was no possibility that its country would unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho stated before the annual General Assembly of the international body that North Korea had taken "important measures of goodwill" over the past year, such as ceasing to conduct nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing facilities and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we have not received any similar response from the United States, he noted.
If we do not trust the United States, we cannot trust our national security, and under those circumstances there is no possibility that we will disarm unilaterally first
Although Ri repeated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a phased denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it steps in step, his statement is important, as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work for the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has pursued an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States has insisted on denuclearization first and has increased pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose coercively, even by objecting to a declaration of war-ending", Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a sham by people who don't know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions is deepening our distrust.
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced by the US leader to the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae in the past five months, adding: "If South Korea had been the party interested in denuclearization instead of the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have been in such a stalemate".
Even so, Ri's tone of speech was radically different from last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korean missiles toward US soil after the evil president Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim Rocket Man.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his bravery in advancing toward disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions needed to be continued until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no set deadline for this: "It could take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia allege that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its advances.
However, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo informed the UN Security Council on Thursday: The imposition of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without breach until we achieve definitive and fully verified denuclearization.
The Security Council has imposed unanimous sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang's ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo spoke to Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but a few hours later, North Korea denounced his "demands" as those of a mobster.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied the appropriate measures.
He said Kim had communicated to him that the "corresponding measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
Thanks to a new course being taught this year at Harvard University, all college students are sleeping more in an attempt to combat the growing male-dominated culture of studying all night drinking caffeine.
One professor found that students at the world's number one university often have no idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, believed to be the first of its kind in the U.S.
Her motivation for starting the course came after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked me why she just found out about this now, in her senior year.
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, first taught this year, explains to students the basic concepts of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, noted that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students barely slept during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books that inform them about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deprivation on sports performance and the importance of setting a sleep routine.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, embolism, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We know that it won't change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe that they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco, said Professor Czeisler.
He said the culture of pride in 'living up late' still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure students are under meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and getting good quality sleep should be students' secret weapon to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, since sleep deprivation causes the brain to feel hungry, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the year before during his first year at Harvard.
He noted that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the entire campus.
He hopes the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider setting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by the screens of electrical appliances and LEDs, which can alter circadian rhythms, causing them to have trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal to bury Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression away from home, when Dolly Menga's attack banished Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox wanted to get their first away win since the 4-1 victory in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard's for the second time in 18 games as coach, leaving his team eight points behind the Hearts, outscored by Ladbrokes Premiership leaders.
Menga's attack came minutes before halftime and the Rangers' uninspired lineup was not up to par at any point.
Now, the Rangers are down to sixth place, Livingston is up to third, behind Hibernian by the goal difference.
The Rangers may be in more trouble, as line judge Calum Spence had to receive medical attention for a head injury after allegedly someone threw an object from the visitor's background.
Gerrard changed eight of the head-forwards who won the game against Ayr, entering the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, for his part, pulled out the 11 Livingston players who scored a point against the Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his highly organized team drowned opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston took the ball better when he had it.
They should have scored two minutes into the start, when Menga made a pass to the space for Scott Pittman who passed through the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder kicked her out.
Keaghan Jacobs made a deep mistake for Captain Craig Halket, but his fellow defensive back, Alan Lithgow, could only send her out by the long stick.
The Rangers regained control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the final third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been penalised in the 15th minute of the match, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson turned a deaf ear to the Colombian's request.
The Rangers got two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely found himself in trouble dealing with Lassana Coulibaly's head-butt and Ovie Ejaria's boring pitching.
Although Livingston's 34th-minute goal came against all odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers failed to cope with a deep, stalling move by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fitted the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed it to Menga to score the goal.
At rest, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, as the steering wheel passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly went off his line to block him.
Still, the Livingston continued to lead visitors to exactly the kind of game he liked, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing one long pass after another.
Holt's could have taken more of an advantage in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to turn Jacobs down before Lithgow finished a head corner that didn't come in.
Rangers replacement Glen Middleton claimed a penalty towards the end of the game after a run-in with Jacobs, but, again, Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Sunday Morning Almanac section: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and TALKING... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that culminated in the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film The Bells of Coronado, with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in seemingly incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: What the hell is that?
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear your headphones, you can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of minerals.
Evans: It's like a radio!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires removing immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab.
So they can see a protein common to many cancers and re-inject them.
A trial of the vaccine is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman who was given the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires removing immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab so they can see a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 promotes the growth of different types of cancer, such as breast, ovarian, lung or colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to taking patients' immune cells and teaching them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a pro-Trump diatribe in a MAGA cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the Saturday Night Live studio after an erratic performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump, and said he would run for election in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the hat with the message Make America Great Again, he began to smear Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
I often talk to a white person and he asks me how I like Trump if he's racist.
Well, if I was concerned about racism I would have left America a long time ago, he declared.
SNL began the show with a Matt Damon sketch in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded West's bronze recording to social media.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
Besides, West told the audience that he had been bad behind the scenes for wearing that hat.
They messed with me.
I was told not to go out with my hat on.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep, he declared, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how sleepy I am?" and added that he was wearing his superman coat, because that meant no one could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.
His comments received public scrutiny on at least two occasions and SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported.
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West baffled many when he came out on stage to sing I Love It dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for standing up to the crowd".
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West was just "being himself" and that's absolutely wonderful.
But I do not award anyone (by buying their music or clothes, or supporting their art) who I believe is embracing and spreading an ideology that is dangerous to my community.
He's free.
We too, he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now the person formerly known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been called Snoop Lion, not to mention the now-defunct music legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later to the artist formerly known as Prince.

The defendant is expected to appear in the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The DA's gonna look into the charges.
Kit Harington, the star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that those screen roles often conveyed to young boys that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes something has gone wrong and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her casting partner in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she finds it "quite important" to address this issue.
Personally, I think it's quite important right now, where have we gone wrong with masculinity?, he commented.
What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems we see now?
Kit believes television may have some responsibility for the increasingly toxic masculinity due to its so masculine characters.
And he continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the street that makes young people feel they have to be this specific form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it's clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, stating that he is "tired of battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in True West, Sam Shepard's stage play that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he's ever done from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the show, so in that sense, she gave me my future family and my life from now on", he declared.
Rose portrayed Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on a farm owned by Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
In the country, more than 820 000 people are affected, according to health authorities.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 were reported about 40 000 new cases.
The vast majority of these were sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has decreased in practice overall, Chinese health authorities said at a congress held in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT collective suffers from much discrimination.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry women.
Many of the diseases transmitted are due to the lack of adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data from Republican Party senators and claims that these are dangerous lies and conspiracy theories
Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday criticized allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal data of three Republican Party U.S. senators on Wikipedia's pages about lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were driven by commentators and far-right websites.
"Lies, lies and more vile lies", Waters commented in a Twitter post.
The information reported included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Capitol posted the information online during a Senate panel session regarding the sexual misconduct allegations made against Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate.
The leak was made sometime after the three senators had interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the publications was associated with Waters' office and made public the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
The member of my staff whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations was not at all responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.
Waters' statement drew immediate criticism on the Internet, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"He lies to this information with anger", Fleischer wrote.
This suggests not the temperance needed to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
You must not rebel.
You must not question the accuser's motives.
You must keep calm and serenity.
It seems Fleischer wanted to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's appearance.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who intends to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious", he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent allegations.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are discovered, he continued,and that they are held legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all my staff.
Johnny English's Critique: Back in action.
It's now become a tradition to look for Brexit nods in any new film with a British focus, and it seems that this is exactly what you should do with this new installment of the parody action-comedy franchise Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Is this ironic self-satire about how clearly insane we are the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, incompetent Johnny English, with his leaping eyes and his expressionless face, has renewed his license to kick his leg for the second time.
Of course, it's the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange pretensions to spill glamour, has a little Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that kind that played a single note on the theme of Fire Cars that was played at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
In addition, it was based on the mysterious traveler and international man represented years ago by Atkinson in the already forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, sowing chaos behind him.
In this last installment, there's one or two good moments.
I loved seeing Johnny English approach a helicopter dressed in medieval armor as the propellers hit the hull.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is outstanding, but the humor is pretty short and oddly superfluous, especially now that movie franchises like 007 and Mission Impossible add comic ingredients without any problems.
The humor seems more to be aimed at children than adults, and to me, Johnny English's absurd misadventures are not as ingenious and accurate as Atkinson's silent jokes in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the recurring current argument is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain's top-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all its active agents in the face of the dismay of the agent on duty, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the drop that fills the glass for the prime minister, a pompous, cornered character who's watching her political popularity sink: Emma Thompson is doing her best in this character who's almost like Theresa May, but the script doesn't leave much room to work.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, since all active spies are in danger, he will have to turn to someone who is retired.
That must be the clumsy Johnny English, who now teaches at a shitty school, though he does give off-the-cuff classes on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, since this is a spy academy similar to the Rock School.
English is moved to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunits with his suffering old buddy Bough, again represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married man with a submarine captain, a nice role for which he doesn't take advantage of Vicki Pepperdine enough.
So, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Service get back into action, with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a charismatic billionaire in the tech world who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, unleash chaos by hiding in the luxurious Volta yacht; furthermore, English becomes pure anarchy by trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
They were definitely used to the last sequence, but, as funny and witty as it is, the whole thing still conveys a somewhat childish feeling.
A fairly regular product.
As with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but wonder if the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do real justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies it is drawing up a plan for Britons to work four days a week, but they are charged five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is going to think of a radical plan where the British would work four days a week, but they would charge five.
The party allegedly wants the owners of the companies to allocate the savings made thanks to the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers, giving them an additional day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would fit into the party's plans and economic agenda to tilt the country in favour of workers.
This shift to a four-day week has received the support of the Trade Union Congress, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: A review of the directive is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not be achieved overnight, but the four-day work week is definitely a matter that the party hopes to incorporate to rebalance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party".
The Labour Party would not be the first to back such ideas, as the Green Party had already promised a four-day work week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, for the time being, not all the Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not part of party policy and will not be discussed at this time".
Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference held last week to expose his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was willing to recover powers from "anonymous and "used" directors in charge of public service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also include the idea that current water company shareholders will not recover their full stake, as a Labour government could apply deductions that corresponded to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers on the boards of directors of the companies and to create an inclusive ownership fund in which 10% of the shares of private sector companies would be allocated to employees, which would mean annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk on "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh and whether it could get them to change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote for his confirmation as a Supreme Court justice for at least a week and also raises the question of whether the results that are concluded could influence any Republican senator who decides to finally withdraw his support.
In an interview that will air Sunday, "60 Minutes" journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could bring to light information that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Of course", Kennedy said.
"I was in favor of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, after the allegation came out, and I said, 'Did you?'
He was firm, determined, and cutting-edge".
Graham's vote, however, seems unshakable.
"I already have a decision made around Brett Kavanaugh and I would dismiss the accusation", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it vehemently", Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she names has been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It's always the same, I don't see anything new in this case".
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it succeeded in reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive starboard band is gathering for an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people travel to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event's real goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness-raising group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If you want to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), concertgoers have had to complete a series of tasks or actions, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or anything else that helps raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
However, what has Global Citizen achieved 12 years after reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to take action or is it just a form of the so-called "cluttivism", which is called the stance we adopt when we think we are doing something really useful by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters in favor of a large number of diverse goals.
Through these actions, they claim to have gotten world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that arose from its shares, of which, at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly influenced almost 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", a UK-based association of investors and executives united by a common commitment to "helping children grow and develop to their full potential". To this end, they have proposed providing Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens contributors.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens collaborators like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice from malnutrition", Tracey Ullman, ambassador for "The Power of Nutrition", told the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also claimed that, after carrying out more than 5000 actions to try to improve nutrition in the UK for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen contributor responded: "It's going to be a long, hard road and, on many occasions, we're going to stumble and fall.
But as the human rights and anti-apartheid movements have already achieved, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the performances we will be counting on at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use the Navy to carry out the blockade on Russia's energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary", Washington could use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's alliance with Syria, particularly where it operates on the orders of the legitimate government, is merely a pretext for expansion into new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate energy, as they are with Eastern Europe, becoming the most southern supplier of Europe", he said.
Moreover, according to official information, there are ways and methods of tackling this issue.
"The United States, with its Navy, has the ability to ensure that sea lanes remain open and, where appropriate, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up in the market", he said.
Zinke addressed people attending an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that defines itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
"The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to harness and replace fuels", he warned, while pointing out that Russia only knows one thing to do, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims come as the Trump administration has been trying to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and relegate Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has always insisted that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is worth $11 billion and is expected to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is purely economic and is another sign of unfair competition.
"I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", said Russia's Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow last September.
The US position has, however, been rejected by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she will consider joining the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During an appearance at Holyoke Township, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being raised.
"It's time for women to come to Washington to amend our fractured government and finally have women among the leaders", he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during an appearance at City Hall and stated that he was "leading the country down the wrong path".
"I'm really concerned about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren spoke out loud about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren claimed that "it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote".
A poll was published Thursday in which, however, a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe he should run for the 2020 election.
58 percent of "possible" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
However, 32 percent of respondents did support his candidacy.
The poll showed stronger support for the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible 2020 candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin speaks of Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at a rally by Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"The situation my son is going through, through everything he's been through since he came back, is well known to the other families who suffer the effects of TEPT and other injuries that our soldiers come back with", he told the crowd who gathered at a pro-Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo that no one wants to talk about, and commented on her son and other war veterans who "come back with a different, hardened attitude, wondering if there really is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the military, have given to their country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, charged with one count of domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to get a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a judicial appeal to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a "friendly" letter Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum seeker who faces the current directive, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case "Grace v. Sessions" brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against federal policy in August has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and her children, who are members of a violent gang", abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the U.S., as nations facing widespread domestic and gang violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Migration Appeals (BIA) that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum in this country.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine made statements Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law".
'Under federal law, all asylum applications must be dismissed under the particular facts and circumstances of the claim and, on the other hand, this exception violates that principle,' the amicus curiae brief states.
The lawyers also indicated in the letter that the policy of denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy by stating that they tend to become entrepreneurs more frequently and "suppose a necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum can be sought by people who leave their home countries because of persecution or threats of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said when announcing the directive on 11 June.
Asylum was never created as a way to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people around the world face on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll rises in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"The situation is very tense", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she tried to comfort her fever-stricken baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce".
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search for the few drowned belongings left in an effort to recover what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, also damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are flooded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside the building due to the continuous, also very strong, replicas.
He couldn't help crying when he told us about the violent earthquake he experienced while he was on the fifth floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to get ourselves safe.
I got caught in the debris of the collapsed wall, I think", Haris told The Associated Press.
"I heard my wife cry for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're all right".
US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily's payroll supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to meddle in the November 6 US congressional elections, something China has vehemently denied.
Trump's accusation of Beijing's attempt to influence the US election marked what US officials pointed to Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign launched by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their trade activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led to increased import tariff levels on both sides.
China's countervailing tariffs that were in place at the beginning of the trade war were meant to fall on exporters from states like Iowa, which backed Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, which is one of the top exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
As Branstad wrote in an op-ed in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China "is intensifying that pressure even further with ad publications in our free press".
"To try to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is leveraging the precious American tradition of free speech and free press by trying to publish a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"Instead, in the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, you see only a few dissenting voices and no real reflection of the disparate opinions that people in China may have about the worrying trajectory that their country's economy is taking, as the media are controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most relevant newspapers eluded the offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts say Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the midterm vote with the Kavanaugh debacle.
As many prominent Republicans are closing ranks in favor of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over various sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that a backlash, especially by women, may occur in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this have been very intense and many Republicans have expressed their desire to move forward with the vote.
"In these kinds of matters it is not possible to back down", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s latest attempt to position himself in favor of the FBI investigation was enough to calm voters upset about the matter.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget tomorrow or November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters who gathered at the Senate doors chanted "November is coming!" at the time when Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats goes beyond any forecast", Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
"People say the impact is already very relevant and, indeed, it is.
But it could be even higher, especially among the undecided women in the suburbs and the younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who don't usually vote even if they don't like the president".
Even before Ford's public testimony in which he detailed his sexual abuse allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts indicated that a setback could occur if Republicans continued with the confirmation.
"This issue has become a big mess for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, NBC News reported.
"It's not just a matter of committee voting or final voting, not even sitting on the bench for Kavanaugh; it's also about how Republicans have handled all this and how they've treated her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA (a group that helps elect Democrats), told the news channel.
Americans, however, seem divided; they don't know who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, although a few more are siding with the latter.
A new YouGov survey indicates that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony is definitely or likely, while 35 percent say they believe Kavanaugh is definitely or likely.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's statements, as well as, at least, those of another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her while drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez, for his part, alleged that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project in the technology legend, a company that builds on Berners-Lee's Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"It has to be now", he said of the startup.
"It is a historic moment".
The application uses Solid technology so users can create their own "online personal data storage" or POD.
It may contain lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
Something that is unique about online personal data storage is that the user is the one who completely decides who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal training through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is to incorporate the resources, processes and skills needed so Solid can reach everyone.
At the moment, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the developers included in the template who were hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not they're going to introduce a radical change where all of their business models are completely modified overnight.
"We're not going to ask permission".
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on net neutrality.
Despite even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won a Victory Cross in World War I
The only Church of England clergyman to win a Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant has been honoured in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918 at the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and he never knew he had been awarded the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, her two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said that it was "of a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned his grandfather the decoration.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through thick fog and under intense machine gun and cannon fire".
He then ran to the line of fire and, with "greatest bravery", made the line go forward before reaching a cannon with one hand and knocking down three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "so great that I will never be able to live up to his standards, but they were very instructive".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, which featured the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is evident when he is shown such large support".
MMA fans were up all night for the Bellator 206, but they only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine you stay up all night watching the entire Bellator 206 so that at the end you're not allowed to watch the main event.
The San Jose poster featured 13 fights, six of which were included on the main card, and in the UK it was to be broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, UK viewers were stunned when the show switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having to stay up until the early hours of the morning just to watch the fight.
A Twitter follower described the move to cartoons as "a heavy joke".
"There is a government regulation that regulates content that is broadcast from 6 a.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to change to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pep the piggy, yeah".
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said they would modify the show to include British viewers in the upcoming editions.
"When I think about the option of retransmission, I think it can work", Coker said.
"But it's 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We're looking at how to do it.
Believe me, when the programming was changed, they got a lot of messages and not all of them were kind, exactly.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I can promise you next time it won't happen.
We'll reduce it to five fights instead of six, which is what we normally do, and we try to offer more than usual so that the fans are happy and we're out.
It's a very unfortunate situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a winner.
At 24, she told us that she didn't realize until she was in high school that "not everyone was like me".
In the first show of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said her intention in speaking about gay rights was to convey "hope" to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to underestimate the importance of winning the Olympics.
The regular host of this mythical program, Kirsty Young, will be away for a few months due to illness.
On Laverne's first show, Daley, who portrayed himself as a marginalized person, commented that he felt "inferior" to the rest during his childhood, because "you weren't socially accepted to like boys and girls".
He said, "Until today, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he claimed, so he wasn't disappointed when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told it because he felt lucky to live in freedom, without retaliation, and wanted to pass on that "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion stated that for him too it was a complete surprise to fall in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year the Oscar winner, who has been with her for 20 years, although she specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you live so long since you were so young" (he went to his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of your age who's been through the same ups and downs as you.
The couple had a son in June whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their "global perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all the answers would have been 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, without a doubt, Robbie".
Her son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was if they had London 2012 passes, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I wasn't able to tell her I wasn't going to be able to be in the front row", she said.
"He had his hand between mine when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until that precise moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn't invincible", she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew at that moment that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of my own in an Olympic Games, there was nothing better", she said.
This was also the inspiration for her first song, Proud by Heather Small, which accompanied her to the Olympic Games preparation phase.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low form, sat on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to prevent it from becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the event held every two years to score a record for the 12th time, was knocked out by Captain Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has so many times done for the United States, the five-time major champion had to settle for cheering at times and, at other times, trying to perfect his game on the field and thus be able to rectify what troubles him.
Never the most direct of drivers, not even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not in his best shape for the Le Golf National course, where the long rough punishes continuously with wrong shots.
And, if the pitch is no longer discouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, faces the brilliant British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has joined debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games they've played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below the start of the 12 individual games, started out impressively, Mickelson's game could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, and he couldn't say much more.
"He understood perfectly the role I had today, slapped me in the back and, surrounding me with his arm, said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He's very confident in himself.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I thought they'd be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it was supposed to be.
He wants to be there, like the rest of us".
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's mark of most Ryder Cup games played.
It could be the last of a whole Ryder Cup career that had never quite matched the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 ties, although Furyk said his presence brought much more intangible values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, ingenious, likes to make fun of others; it's great to have him on the team", he explained.
"I think the younger players loved having him as a support, also this week; it was fun.
It brings more than just play".
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although you enter with a substantial advantage in the final days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a side captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to finish off the others by treading their heels by a minimum margin, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"Don't stop reminding you that we did a great tournament at Valderrama; we also did it at Brookline and lost, we did it at Valderrama and won, but for very little", said Bjorn, portrayed, after watching the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead it with a 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History will teach me and everyone else that this team is not finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This doesn't end until the points are on the marker.
We have a goal to fulfill, which is to win this trophy, and that's all we have to think about.
I say that all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we're very aware of what's on the other side where they are, no more or less than the best players in the world".
Proud of what his players have done on a very hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I wouldn't want to get ahead.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are individual performances and this is different.
It's great to share what happens with a partner when things go well, but when you're alone, you put your golfing skills to the test.
That's the message to pass on to players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now it's time to put your partner aside, go out and get the best out of yourself".
Against Bjorn, his team-mate Jim Furyk will try to get his players to do better individually than they did as a pair, with the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points from four.
Furyk himself has been on both ends in the last few days of those big tournaments and was part of the team that won at Brookline and then ended up losing when Europe held the "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every word", he said when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the final day.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and made them come out with the feeling that we were going to try and do something magical tomorrow".
We assigned Thomas the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think they cover the whole tour", Bjorn said of his individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era ships, but it won't be until at least next year due to faulty systems and the progressive increase in costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship leading the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a statement by a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery derailed the completion of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as radar, infrared and very low-resonance acoustics.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continuing delays have caused the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power overseas) to be outdated by the time they start service, Die Zeit points out.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It's the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipyard after it was delivered.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that left the ship virtually useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - half the staff of the former Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the vessel is overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as other similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price of the entire project, including crew training, has also been a problem.
It is believed to have reached €3.1 billion ($36 billion), instead of the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy is "leaving without ships capable of deployment".
The officer said the problem has been getting worse over time, because old ships were taken out of service, but not replaced by others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
This new research, which has been conducted in a Scottish Highlands state, tries to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
Everything that is discovered is expected to shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common bats and sopranos as well as the Daubenton Riverhead bats and long-eared browns from the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic locations on the property to track bat activities during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile research with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds recorded to find out how often bats call and what species do.
A report and a habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and how forests should be maintained for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK have declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by the construction and development of their nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticidal paper and other chemical treatments of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind,
But because of their nighttime hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes in achieving their target.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique that locates ants and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the bat issue very seriously.
It has ten trained experts in the field, who regularly carry out surveys, nest inspections and, occasionally, rescue operations.
The organisation has even opened Scotland's first and only bat reserve in the Threave state in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The property manager, David Thompson, says it's the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Threave, we have a fantastic bat zone", he said.
"We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the right habitat.
However, there is still much unknown about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop".
It stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance tasks within the properties, as a breeding colony can be unintentionally destroyed and 400 females and young could be killed, which would mean the annihilation of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to collaborate.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species about which we don't know how their populations evolve".
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while his lawyers pursue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the allegations of rape as "fake news", and says people "want to make themselves known" at the expense of their name.
His lawyers have been instructed to report the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
The Portugal and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of paying him $375,000 to cover up the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
With a video from Instagram Live that has already amassed 142 million followers hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33, called the reporting "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no, you know what?
What they said today is false", says the five-time Ballon d'Or winner looking at the camera.
"They only want publicity at the expense of my name.
It's the same story as always.
They want to make themselves famous by just mentioning me, but they do, I can't help it.
I am a happy man and everything is fine", the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the allegations that appear in what they have called "an inadmissible reporting of privacy suspicions", Reuters reports.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount that corresponds to the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident appears to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room and there he allegedly raped her annually, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99 percent" good guy and that he had cheated on that remaining "one percent".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consented.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and they took pictures of the wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she had "terror to reprisals" and worried about "being humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old woman claims she is trying to cancel the deal, as she remains traumatized by the events.
When the alleged assault occurred, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has switched to Juve, a big Italian football player for a €100 million contract.
Brexit: UK would always regret losing carmakers
The UK would "regret for life" if it lost its position as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Industry Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK would inform the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, production at its Burnaston factory near Derby would be temporarily halted.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer claimed that the impact of customs delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90 percent were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain breaks with the EU at the end of March, there will be production stoppages at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without a deal, particularly in relation to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of carmakers are the problems that could arise in assembly chains in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is based on the adjusted production mode (just in time or last minute), where parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers to make custom cars.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a deal on 29 March, there could be a disruption at the border which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and spare parts shortages.
Toyota would be unable to house the amount of material equivalent to more than one day's inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and in that case production would be halted.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan, which sets out future relations with the EU, is "precisely calibrated to avoid such border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal that not only allows us to get out of the way right now but we have to seize the opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence from Toyota, among many other manufacturers, is that we need to be able to continue what has, so far, been a tremendously successful supply chain set".
Toyota was not able to say how long production would be stopped, but warned that in the long run, the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union's manager at the plant, said its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never recover".
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a precise and compelling plan that defines our future relations with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with vice attorney general Rod Rosenstein could "postpone another week", as the dispute over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in Russian elections, links between Trump's aid and Russia, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation of whether Trump decides to fire the deputy attorney general or not and thus compromise Mueller's independence has fueled Washington's crush for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded the conversations he had with Trump with a microphone he himself was wearing to try to relieve the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, amid news where he was said to be about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (who was then at the United Nations in New York) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would delay the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be postponed another, considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We'll decide on the march and I'll go inform the press, as I usually do".
Some journalists would dispute that claim: Sanders hasn't held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked what the motives were.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences was not due to an aversion to TV journalists acting grandly, though he said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they boast".
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president conducts more question-and-answer sessions than any other president before him", he said, while citing without proof: "We have contrasted those numbers".
Press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option to ask the president of the United States directly, I think it's much better than me.
We tried to do it many times and you've seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public sessions or press conferences with dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences with him only happen on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week in New York, the president demonstrated why he was, where he made a wild and sometimes bizarre appearance to the journalists who were gathered there.
The Secretary of State for Health writes to EU NHS Scotland workers about their fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU staff working at HHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish for them to continue with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of citizenship applications for EU members working in public services that are not dependent on central government.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the exit were followed in which the expected decisions were chosen this fall.
However, the UK Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario where there would be no agreement.
I know this must be very upsetting to you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and other countries bring valuable experience and many skills that reinforce and improve the work of the health service, which benefits patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue to count on you".
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers player Christion Abercrombie was surgically taken in after suffering a head injury last Saturday when they lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennesse's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He came to the band and crashed right there", Reed said.
Both coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before placing him on a stretcher and taking him for in-depth examination.
A member of the Tennessee State staff told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been released from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details yet about the type of injury or damage caused" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a sophomore redshirt, is playing his first season with Tennessee State after being traded from Illinois.
He hit five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, with whom he totaled 18 throughout the season.
Foreigners will be subject to a higher estate transfer tax when they buy property in the United Kingdom
Foreigners will be subject to a higher estate transfer tax when they buy property in the UK and the extra money raised by this measure will be used to shelter the "unhousehold" under the new Conservative plans
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract younger voters
The increase in the estate tax will be imposed on those who are not paying taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to be used for the homeless
The additional money raised by the increase in the transfer tax on estates to foreign buyers of property in the UK will be used to help the "unroofed", Theresa May announced today.
The measure is seen as an attempt to counteract the success Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and harass those with higher incomes.
The increase in the estate transfer tax will be levied on individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK and that money will be used to incentivise government policy to combat the problem of street begging.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, including the increase in levels introduced two years ago on secondhand housing and the buy-to-let system, could reach up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, which causes prices to rise and makes it difficult for first time buyers to access affordable housing.
Many of the country's wealthiest areas (especially in the capital) have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the broadcasting tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping very high property prices by greedily buying land without intent to use it and urged Mrs May to remove the quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain's "shameful housing problem".
Mr Corbyn has announced a number of very attractive housing reforms, including rental controls and an end to unreasonable evictions.
It also proposes to give local authorities more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
And that involves solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy housing more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a home has become too difficult for many people to achieve and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street remains too real".
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland coach says his "primary goal" is to become Scotland coach at some point.
The 42-year-old is excited about the possibility of revitalizing the North East club, which currently sits third in League One (England's third division), three points behind the first.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B-hat", Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it's something that's always made me want to come back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I manage to run a club successfully".
Among Ross's predecessors as manager of Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he felt no fear when he moved to such established names at such a big club, after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Right now, success for me is measured by whether I can get this club back to the Premier League,
because the structure and facilities of this club are, without a doubt, Premier League facilities", he said.
"It's not easy to get it, but I could only consider that I've achieved my goal here when I can get the club back to where it should be".
Ross has only been coaching for three years, having spent time as an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint on the coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third division and made St. Mirren move from being on the verge of relegation to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross claims he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads", he recalled, referring to the time he took over the Alloa.
"I always thought management was my best bet, far more than playing.
It may sound strange, because it was good, I made a very good living from it and enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer the stress and pressure of that job, yet I feel fine in the direction.
I always wanted to train and now I've managed to do it, it's the time of my adult life when I've felt better, no doubt about it".
You can hear the whole interview on Sportsound on Monday 30 September, on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has boosted profits in British pubs struggling to survive, but it has concentrated all the pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubs and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7 percent in July, while restaurant profits fell 4.8 percent, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consultancy, who was responsible for collecting the figures, commented: "The heat of the day and England's continued World Cup run have still kept the pattern of the previous month of June in July, when pubs increased their profits by 2.8%, while restaurants have fallen even slightly further.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant business activity in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving mainly drinks had their strongest month, compared to most restaurants, where they reduced profits.
Pubs serving mainly food also suffered from the heat, though not as drastically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In managed bars and pubs, sales of drinks rose by up to 6.6 percent during the month, while meals fell by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, of RSM's hospitality and leisure analysts, said: "These results follow the trend we've seen since late April.
The timing and impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors in terms of sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the 4.8% drop in sales compared to last year will be particularly painful in view of continued cost pressures.
The long, hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food operators and the weather will tell if the more moderate temperatures we've had in August will provide the relief they need.
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones that have opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand deployments.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK restaurant, bar and pub sector, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9bn and being the market benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts behind their parents' backs
One in five children (some even 11 years old) have secret social media accounts behind their parents and teachers, a survey reveals
The survey, which surveyed 20,000 high school students, revealed an increase in fake Instagram pages
News has heightened fears of sexual content being published
20% of pupils said they had a "main" account showing their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth experienced in fake Instagram accounts, a reference site for photo sharing.
The news has heightened fears of sexual content being published.
About 20 percent of students said they had a clean "main" account that showed their parents, while they had other private accounts.
A mother who happened to meet her 13-year-old daughter's secret site saw a teenager encourage others to "rape me".
The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create Internet spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most awarded track and field athlete and its president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want the sport to benefit from its great international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is recognized and respected throughout the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from having her on board", said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I like being the spokesperson for athletes and I hope I can contribute and help develop the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among the four gold medals he won and is now a regular expert on the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He tweeted: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time would determine whether or not I would recover or how far I would.
It's been exhausting, but I've managed to recover fully, I had to learn to walk again, and I'm currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!"
The sacaleche ad, which compares mothers to cows, divides opinion on the Internet
A sackling company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what is theoretically the world's first silent bagpipe, consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a somewhat ironic music video showing some mothers telling the story of the freedom that the new milk extractor gives them.
Four real women dance in a haystack as a dance floor, along with some cows, with lyrics like, "Yes, I chew myself, but I don't have a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, they're not uber, they're my breasts".
The choir goes on to say, "Order them, order them, I'm feeding their babies, order them, order them, I'm milking my women".
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has created a major controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it manages to focus on the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth to produce milk, except they take their babies away days after giving birth", one person wrote.
The Elvie milk extractor is discreetly fitted in a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who do keep their babies?"
Another comment was: "Here's a more crazy announcement".
However, others defended the ad, such as a woman who admitted that the song was "distracting".
I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'm sure I'd have one.
When I used the bomb, I felt totally like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I'm not going to go over it.
It's a product genius, a woman told us.
Another person commented: It's a funny ad directed at mothers who use a breastfeeding pump (sometimes at work or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The advertisement neither praises nor judges the dairy sector.
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they've been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the braces.
The campaign concept is based on the perception that many women who pump milk out with the pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and is quietly coupled inside the breastfeeding bra, allowing its users to move, hold their babies and even go out into the street with the pump running.
Mother's partner and ECD, Ana Balarin, comments: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a daring and provocative launch.
By showing the parallels between expressive women and dairy cows, what we wanted to do was draw attention to the use of breastfeeding pumps and their challenges, while also showing in an entertaining and intimate way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump offers.
This isn't the first time the Elvie bomb has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two marched down the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children discreetly displaced to a Texas border camp
The number of detained migrant minors has seen a considerable increase, despite the fact that monthly inflow at the border has practically remained at the usual levels, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration are complicating the possibility of sponsoring these children.
Traditionally, most godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to adopt a child would endanger their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential adoptive parents and other adult family members should file their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who requested sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
About 80% of the sponsors or their relatives are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we're still chasing these people, Albence said.
In their effort to process minors more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a maximum of one month of their detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous norm, according to receptionist workers.
Many of them will testify via videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered fit for shelter will be deported as soon as possible.
According to the workers in the shelters and the system reports that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent kidnappings or attempted escape.
According to the defenders, these concerns are growing even more in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to their size, the signs of discomfort in these children are overlooked.
Moreover, moving to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even as the country's war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue will be dealt with accordingly.
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally, he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism" in Syria is almost over, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to fight in this holy battle until we purge all Syrian territories of both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily providing training and advice to Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 ground troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the right conditions were being given for them to return and blamed some Western countries for sowing irrational fears that made refugees decide to stay out of the country.
We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns, he said.
They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The Russia-Turkey agreement prevented a large-scale assault by Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the agreement had a clear deadline and expressed hope that military action will focus on jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters (linked to Al-Qaeda), who will be eradicated.
Staffan de Mistura, a UN special envoy, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of government and opposition members soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, arguing that the panel's work should be restricted to reviewing the articles of the current constitution and warned against any interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers will surely expect, a removal or scandal ends his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, peak-time ratings have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and virtually tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at peak viewing time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has surpassed cable channel ratings with 3.5 million viewers for major nightly news shows.
It's a strange attraction that we still can't figure out, says Neal Baer, author-producer of Designated Survivor, an ABC drama series about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride he made in Boston before the 2016 election.
The cab driver told him he'd vote for Trump.
Why? he asked her.
'Cause it makes me laugh, that's the answer Scovell got.
Chaos is always on the rise in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike anything else seen on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the possibility of immigrant families being reunited, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, the information is out of bounds when you think you've been watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing the use of the deep background sources Bob Woodward used for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather hunter (a garment of exaggerated pride, in The Washington Post's words) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' squeaky descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
By offering something new every night, it's partly what makes everything look like a reality show, says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, when he talks about Trump's alternate casting of the show and his daily twists of the plot (whether entering a fight against the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you don't want to be left behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27 degrees day on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was sheltering inside watching MSNBC while he was filming CNN.
He couldn't get off the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy programs and people were telling us that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Fleiss tells me.
I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right.

Foreign money flows in the tightest midterm elections in the House of Representatives
It's no surprise the influx of money that's coming to Pennsylvania's 17th district, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district with two candidates seeking reelection to the same seat.
This Pittsburgh residential district, recently redesigned, has Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is facing another candidate for reelection, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents former Pennsylvania's 12th District, a district that largely overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has sparked a campaign financing contest between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic National Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, although it later backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a pleasant meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to have the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama returned due to recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan, Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement this month.
But only El Salvador, which had already received about US$140 million in aid in 2017, was sanctioned for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity following a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made clear that their intention was for the conference to proceed, ending any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, diplomats say, is seen as a sign of the importance the administration has given to the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic peacefully without further threats or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for the Bolton White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to deal with internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next step could be the report by special counsel Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public record.
Mueller is also thought to be leading this investigation into the possibility that Trump's campaign would work in parallel with Russia in its attack on our election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be seen holding himself accountable to that chamber, just as he prepares to run again before voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a bunch of conditional, and I'm not suggesting that Trump's downfall is inevitable, or that of his European counterparts.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the contest.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, only to have the West resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been looking at himself in a good light ever since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested secretly filming the president and had speculated about his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says the Times' explanation is not accurate.
How will we respond if the new investigation the FBI has requested into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his charge in the Supreme Court is upheld despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
Besides all this, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these exams, we'll face a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we're not gonna fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic about the Rapid Vienna game
The Rangers will play on Thursday at home against Rapid Vienna, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will place them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
"We managed to get a good point, because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We started the game believing we could get something and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall, the draw was maybe a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we went out for all of them and we were the best team.
This Thursday we have another great European night.
I hope we can get all three points, but it will be a difficult match because they already got a good result in the last game, but with all the public supporting us, I am sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now you see a general atmosphere that everything will be fine.
The team's doing fine, the guys are having a lot of fun and we're having a good training.
I hope we can move forward, leave last season behind and achieve success.
Fear of retirement savings is making some women lose sleep
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about this with their family.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about this subject.
"People want a family member to look after them, but they're not taking steps to have this conversation", says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
This is how we start.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you do not express your wishes well in advance, you will not be able to prepare your family for care.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these options can be a cost determinant.
Incorporate your financial advisor into the conversion, as he can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover expenses or insure yourself with your own savings, as long as you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: advance the legal battles.
Take care of obtaining a health care power to appoint a trusted person to oversee your health care and to ensure that professionals meet their own wishes in case you cannot communicate.
You can also prepare a notary for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you become disabled.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that you are always on time.
It's not just the finances that are at stake: which doctors should you deal with? Martin asks.
What medicines are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
You have to have everything planned.

The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not fatal and the police have called for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, authorities said.
With communications blocked, assistance officials have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that extends along over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, which is a hierarchically lower administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mines also have their importance in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Belt, a zone of high seismic activity, and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Below are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami on December 26 that affected 14 countries and claimed the lives of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of deadly casualties on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck Pidie Jaya's regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it recalled the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time it caused no tsunami, but the collapse of buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of large-scale earthquakes that killed more than 500 people, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and forced thousands of tourists to temporarily evacuate.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, a Wasilla (Alaska) citizen, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to the report released Saturday by Alaska state police.
According to the police report, when a friend of his tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone away.
Palin has been sentenced to probation at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared Saturday in court, where he declared himself "definitely innocent" when asked to testify, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could spend up to a year in prison and receive a $250,000 fine.
He's also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, she was accused of assaulting her father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with the reporting of a domestic violence crime and possessing a weapon in a state of intoxication, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed she punched him in the face.
Several groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside the centre of Sulawesi, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are exceptionally seeking the death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York.
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that hasn't been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental van to carry out an attack last October on a bike lane on the Lower Manhattan West Side highway, knocking down pedestrians and cyclists he found in his path.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov intentionally killed all eight victims and intentionally caused serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent for the death penalty application filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges carry a possible death sentence, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 charges including eight counts of murder with the aid of organized crime, which federal prosecutors often use in these cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation", according to prosecutors, who described the way Saipov carried it out as "atrocity, cruelty and depravity".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, is specified in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. This marriage was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, showed his lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be raised in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defender lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea with a life sentence without possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all people involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously requested prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should take care of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to mobilize the people's army today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had to "feel the warmth" of eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's deputies suggested he should take over the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have left by now if Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge for Prime Minister May to reconcile her divided ranks has been further highlighted when a group of Tories in favour of staying have joined an anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep the compromise plan that was signed in Chequers in the midst of attacks by Brexit supporters, their opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that it would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent backlash, and force eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and chaos.
MP Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a position with responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would have left already, he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers".
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the European Union is completely false".
Pro-Brexit Tory Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, where she told reporters: "I just say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public does not like Chequers' plan, the opposition will not vote in favor and it is not popular with our party and our activists, who are actually the ones who take to the streets and vote for us first.
Forget about Chequers and start listening.
In a message to May, he added: Prime Ministers hold their posts when they keep their promises.
Farage told the congressmen that politicians should be warmed up if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
Now it's a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class, he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell you that we won't let them get away with it
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
We will mobilize the people's army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom
Meanwhile, pro-permanence protesters roamed Birmingham's streets ahead of the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists were waving Tories Against Brexit banners after the group's presentation this weekend.
Labour leader Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security problems they had with a party application during the opening of the conference.
These are the same people who tell us they can deploy the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for harmonious borders, for borderless free trade in Ireland, he added.
It's a complete hoax.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit, he added.
Warren is considering all the possibilities of running for president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider all possibilities to run for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a city meeting Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chair of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility that Warren will face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes having a woman at the top.
An arrested man for the gun-related murder of LSU Sims player
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death, police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon and to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was arrested at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-1, 1.98-meter native of Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders hand him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From pole, Bottas got off to a good start and almost threw Hamilton into oblivion by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to get into the boxes and let Hamilton run in the group queue, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out strongly one lap later and placed behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after an action with the wheels almost stuck that made the Ferrari driver reluctantly have to leave the interior free at risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who turned 21 that day, started from the last row of the grid and placed seventh at the end of the first lap.
He then led a large part of the race while holding onto his tires to achieve a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally got into the boxes on lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace on the remaining eight laps by regaining Raikkonen's fourth position.
It's been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman letting me through.
The team has done an exceptional job of getting the perfect match, Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there are people who are "bad, disgusting and false".
The only thing that could happen and the good thing that is happening these last few days in the Senate, is when you see the anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting and false, he said.
When you read the posts and the leaks, and then they say, "But if I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document?
Oh, no, I'm not.
I didn't leak it.
Well, wait a minute.
We've leaked... no, we haven't leaked it, he added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
She asked me to keep it confidential and so I did.
But his refusal did not seem to be a good fit for the president, who during the Saturday night rally commented: "I'll tell you one thing: that was really bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested the Democrats were using the accusations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the wickedness and the disgust, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to hit to get power and control, the president said as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired Friday's Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants by winning the Saturday home game 5-3 at Dundee.
The Giants achieved an initial two-goal lead thanks to attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie drew the local tie before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured his victory.
This has been the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had just come off a 2-1 win over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very lively opening period, Sullivan again put the local team on the brink of playing at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to tie the game at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again tied the game with a goal in the 27th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match as they reached the end of the second half and secured the win with his team's fifth goal as the final approached.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies so hundreds of people can escape the earthquake plane
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after dying after making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people could take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after a large-scale earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to lash the area and many are trapped among the rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his companions fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He held firm to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped from the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian broadcaster ABC News reported.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are breaking when we hear this", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach several thousand people, and the national disaster mitigation agency says access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong cities is limited.
The number of victims is expected to continue to rise, as there were still many bodies under the ruins and not many people have been contacted, says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors as much as possible, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?, CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says a man has gone missing after the plane crash in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a plane that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific in Micronesia, now says a man has gone missing after saying all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon there was no male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overrun the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.
"That's an extremely good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes comments that he and other travelers managed to advance through a water reaching their waist to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working near a dock improvement also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Data from the aviation safety network indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution finished presenting its arguments Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He exposed to the jury how he used cell phone records to chain the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several mobile phones showing Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, thus contradicting her previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone had been with Chambers's during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he hadn't been to town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's van that night, Sanford said he was lying, because my van was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
The cell phone records indicate they met only a week earlier.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final pleas on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be in the hands of the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and dealing with social issues.
They want to get back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Performers like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
New York nanny sues a couple for firing them after a racist text
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she mistakenly received a text message from her mother complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple denies being racist and compares the lawsuit to a case of extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay at discovering that the new childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day at work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOO OTHER NEGRY PERSON", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing her leg sprain, an uncomfortable Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that his former nanny, who was African-American, had done a terrible job and was instead expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Maurice got the day's pay and sent it home on Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for severance compensation with the intention of receiving compensation of $350 a day for the six-month internal work position she was hired for, though without a contract.
"I want to show you that things don't work that way", he told The Post on Friday, adding that "I know it's a case of discrimination".
The couple responded to claims that they were racist by saying that terminating Maurice's employment was the most reasonable thing, as they feared they could not trust her after offending her.
My wife had sent him something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists, husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
To your newborn?
Come on, you two!
Comparing the lawsuit to an extortion, Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a very difficult situation.
Are you going to go after someone like that?
That's not a very decent thing, the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has been quick to denounce the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington editors feared readers wouldn't identify with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It was difficult to put yourself in someone's shoes who was reading it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know now what we know about Paddington's great success.
After saying that her father, who had worked as a BBC camera before taking inspiration from a toy bear to write the children's book, was confident that his work would be rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was something "agrid sweet" after his passing last year.
De Paddington, whom she describes as a very important member of our family, added that her father was very proud of her ultimate success.
He was a very quiet man and didn't like to brag, he said.
But since Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost like having a son who accomplished something important: you're proud of him, even if it's not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
Nad called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that he was not expected to succeed, said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad telling me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping were slowly depleting and leaving his system.
She was dead early and everything was going out.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I could not groan, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, oblivious to the terrible experience that was going on.
"No one knew", he said.
I nodded my head and tears came down all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
That she needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.
Women in mourning put on cards to avoid suicide is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any father to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that her smile illuminated everywhere.
However, he left the job before he died, as he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found him after taking his own life.
Mrs Davis said: "I am continually concerned that it may have repercussions.
Davis created the cards so people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit quietly, you have to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been Davies' friend for years, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother died.
He didn't say he was depressed or anything like that, he tells us.
A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed his attitude change.
Christmas Day came to its lowest point: when the children opened their presents, he didn't even look at them.
He said his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to overcome it: Leaves a void in the whole family.
It's ruined us.
But we all have to keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
I thought that if we could really get something like what he was asking for (a limited time, limited scope investigation), maybe we could bring some unity, Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was being "picked" amid a partisan shutdown.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigation to go ahead?
His refusal is entirely due to chronology.
If, as expected, the Republicans have a poor showing, their attempts to win the election of the man they want for the country's highest court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling on senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House.
What happens once the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
North Korean defectors are in a fight with Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Southern Unification, said there were 1,127 desertions last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and the high tariffs charged by human traffickers, were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments on the matter.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and are often repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who agreed to work on a Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress.
Without the confidence of the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances we will in no way be the first to disarm unilaterally, Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and says he's not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, said Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was a "historic" and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman acted like that, they would have said she was a hysterical person", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh used the emotion to deny allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and grumbling as he talked about his family and his high school years.
On the committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats, calling the accusations against him "grotesque and clearly coordinated libel" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed his bias against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with those statements with and the way he's persecuted the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi raised her objections when asked if she would challenge Kavanaugh in the event she was confirmed and the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll just say one thing: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, you're not going to be fit not only to be on the Supreme Court, you're not even going to be fit to be on the court you're on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible sentences against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and impartial person to go to court and wait for us to think that everything is fine", Pelosi said.
And women have to punch him.
It's a justified rant, months and years of rage overflowing, and she can't let it go without crying.
"We cry when we get angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's that weird, do I?
He continued: "I was a great help from a woman who was an executive at a company and who told me that she cried when she got angry too, but that she had developed a technique that when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to:
Well, no, I'm mad at you.
And then I kept doing what I was doing.
I thought it was great.
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger in part because they're basically not understood well.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my early jobs, in a male-dominated office, was when I found myself crying with an inexpressible rage. An older woman, a serious manager who had always had a slight fear of me, grabbed me by the knee and dragged me up a ladder.
Don't let anyone ever see you cry, she told me.
They have no idea you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they've cornered you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential careers.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on an extramarital adventure aboard a ship called Monkey Business for which she had to retire from the presidential race, deeply frustrated Schroeder thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of her running for president herself.
"It was not a well-intentioned decision", he told me laughing 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
As the campaign was already well advanced, he was left behind in fundraising, so he promised not to enter the race again unless he raised two million dollars.
It was a losing battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave 1,000 dollars to men, only gave her 250 dollars.
"Do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When she delivered her speech to announce that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overcome by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on attracting voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism), that she became overwhelmed.
"The logical thing would have been to think that I had a nervous breakdown", Schroeder said, recalling the press reaction.
You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put on my gravestone?
Did he cry?
The trade war between the US and China could benefit Beijing
The first salves of the US-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is still long to end, a break between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion in goods, which tax half of the goods entering the United States from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has taken equivalent retaliation, recently imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on US$60 billion worth of products.
China has pledged to match the attacks of the United States, and it's unlikely that the world's second-most powerful economy will loosen anytime soon.
Getting Washington to back down would mean giving in to demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too shameful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of the US trade war could help China positively in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions to start a sharp economic downturn in either country is actually far more dangerous than viewers have acknowledged so far, said Abigail Grace, associate Asia researcher for the Center for New American Security strategic cabinet.
Syria is ready for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of the refugees and is seeking help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to try to restore normalcy.
All conditions are already being set for the voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would be grateful for the help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe is doing the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the North American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris (France).
The United States now has six straight defeats on European soil since it last won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
North American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for most of the tournament, threw his water kick in the hole 16 par 3, thus admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of four players to have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth fell 5-4 to the lowest ranked player in the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
World No. 1 player Dustin Johnson fell 2-1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who has already won eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most tournament wins of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a very rough year.
I'm totally grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy I was able to get the glass back.
It is a achievement of the whole team and I am very happy that I was able to help, said an excited Garcia after the European team's victory.
Now the torch is passed to his compatriot John Rahm, who already defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in a singles match on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride in beating Tiger Woods, since I grew up watching this man", said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, falling just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk, a U.S. Marine, said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm very proud of these guys, they've never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we warmed up the situation in Europe.
But we ruined it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Your 12 players have played a very good game.
We'll regroup, meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and move on.
I love these 12 boys very much and I'm proud to be their captain.
Now it's time to tilt our heads.
They've outdone us.
Red tide update: Reducing concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The new report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general reduction in red tide concentrations in Tampa Bay area areas.
According to the FWC, irregular flowering conditions are being reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting a reduction in concentrations.
The red tide bloom extends approximately 130 miles of coastline from Pinellas County in the north to Lee County in the south.
