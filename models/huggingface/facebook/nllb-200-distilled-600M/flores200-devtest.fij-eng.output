The child who is born goes through childhood in abuse before he is abandoned or escapes.

In Savannah (where the seeds of large trees are transplanted), it is impossible, because the species that live there have lost the hope of healing the body that is needed.
But if the basic necessities of life are neglected, there is distress, mental fatigue, and physical weakness, and death is the result.
The nutrients of the body, such as proteins and legumes found only in vegetables, are difficult to digest for free, and these species, including humans, need to be cooked before eating them.
But when comparing the diet of animals (carrot, cardboard, eggs), they not only can be eaten free of charge but also have a rich diet of amino acids.
If we recall, then we should not be surprised that our forefathers used the wisdom of the ancient Greeks to solve "protein problems" like the monkeys in the savannahs of today.

The iron used to support the wheels was ancient. In the past, it was thought that it would be easier to support the wheels if the wheels were made of iron.

In time, iron wagons were replaced by iron wagons, and in 1767 the first all-metal wagon road was built.
The first movement of humans began two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (an upright human).
