The white pawn on f3, the black pawn on e6, the white pawn on g4, the black pawn on h4 is the match!
White: pawns on a1, pawns on b6, king on c8. Black: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, elephant on b8. White puts the opponent in the suzhuang position, placing the pawn on a6, after which black has only two options: take the pawn on a6 or move the elephant to any other field diagonally b8-h2. In the first case, white moves the pawn from b6 to b7 and bets the match. In the second case, white pawn takes the black pawn on a7 with the same result.
