Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a widely held theory, but it may also provide details that fossils cannot usually provide, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's fur is brownish chestnut on the upper side with a pale or carotenoid underside.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers had no well-developed trunk, called rachis, but had other features - spines and barbels - researchers concluded that rachis may have been a later evolutionary development than other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for temperature or appearance adjustment. The researchers argue that, although this is a dinosaur's tail, the sample shows adult bird feathers, not chickens.

Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evenings, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision following special procedures.

The road to the crash site is temporarily closed and emergency services are evacuating the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially treated at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been charged in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with murdering his own son.
He's being held pending charges and a trial, but any eyewitness evidence may have been compromised because his photo has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently and the courts view the publication of the photograph as potentially prejudicial.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that "journalists seem to be walking in dangerous paths if they publish photos of suspects, etc".
The Crown Office, which is overall in charge of the prosecution, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, would refer to a border dispute, which Palestine wanted based on borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics covered were the future of Jerusalem sanctified by both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded a continuous military presence for ten years in the valley once the deal was signed, while the Palestinian Authority agreed to a military presence for only five years.
Shooters in additional pest control trials must be closely supervised by the guards as trials are monitored and their effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, eligible volunteers are recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Official Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received thorough training and safety instructions.
Martelly was sworn in as a member of the new nine-member Provisional Election Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of calculations to move the country towards new elections.
The inquiry was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, which have at times been violent, were triggered by the disputed elections that were supposed to be held since 2011.
There were 60 reported cases of malfunctioning iPods marked by overheating, causing six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been made aware of 27 accidents related to the device.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of an additional 34 heat incidents, which the company called "not serious".
"The ministry responded by calling the delay in Apple's report "deeply regrettable".
The earthquake shook the Marianas at 07:19 local time (21.19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there was no indication of a tsunami.
Former Philippine police officers capture Hong Kong tourists by hijacking a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, have been released early, as have the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly woman who wanted to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as a gynaecologist and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births during his free time.
His research showed that when given the hormone, the fetal lungs mature more quickly.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Even his fellow wrestlers pay tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer says, 'Luna was the first Extreme Queen, my first manager, Luna died on the night of her second moon, unique as she was, a strong woman.'
"Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as scary as I was... maybe even more so... I loved her and I'll miss her... hopefully she's in a better place now".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
In a poll on this view, 34 percent of them wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In an extreme poll, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was scheduled to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaints, her fitness status was in doubt.
He was unable to take the medication needed to relieve his pain, as it was banned from the Olympic games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has found the largest prime number known to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets are the source of the water that's being delivered to Earth, along with organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially Earth, since comets collided with Earth in the past.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
"He called the rumors "political gibberish and nonsense".
He speculated on running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow airplanes to fly on shorter routes, and save millions of gallons of fuel annually, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, rather than the old radar-based technology on the ground, to make it easier for air traffic controllers to find the exact location of the aircraft with better precision and provide more accurate information to the pilot.
Additional transport will not be operated and diesel trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking and ride facilities and car parks are not on the ground.
Concerns about the lack of transportation increase the likelihood that the match will be forced to be played indoors without fans.
A study published in the journal Scientific on Thursday reports the formation of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in just two generations, a process previously believed to have taken longer, due to the breeding of the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into many different shapes, including being rolled into small shapes.
Gold could be drawn into thin wire, which could be twisted and woven, or it could be forged or rolled into sheets.
Gold can be made so thin that it would stick to other metals, or it can be made so thin that it is sometimes used as a decoration for hand paintings in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
It's called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether it is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is indicated by the number of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
The hydrogen ion is a proton that has been stripped of its electron (because the hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders into one, then crush into balls with clean, wet hands.
The moisture in your hand will react with the outer layer, which will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have flushing toilets in almost every home, connected to an advanced waste disposal system.
Remnants of sewerage systems are found in many houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes combined with public baths, where men and women used them together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and bounces it back, almost instantly.
It's launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere changes some of the light and our view.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to put a satellite or a telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is give us easier and faster transportation.
It brings us to trains, cars, and many other modes of transportation.
The medium-sized cat underneath preys on medium-sized animals, such as rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat much more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special job that each cat carries to keep them from competing with the other cats.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three adult male siblings, along with 30 females and their offspring.
Females are usually closely knit together, like a big family of sisters and daughters.
Prides of lions behave like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
An all-round athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times as much as a human.
Tigers are still a group (Genus Panthera) with lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of a tiger is not like the roar of a lion with its full voice, but is more like a word spoken with a roar, a shout.
Ocelot prefers to eat small animals. Ocelot will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if possible. Almost all animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller in size.
Scientists speculate that the ocelot follows and seeks prey by sniffing, sniffing for traces of prey on the ground.
They can see clearly in the dark with night vision capabilities, and they also move very quietly. The ocelot hunts its prey by blending with its surroundings, then ambushing it.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originated (such as if they move to a mountain or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find a different environment from the one they inhabited before.
These new environments have different resources and competitors, so the new populations need different features or adaptations to be able to become stronger competitors than they needed to be in the past.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they seem to shrink like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can't be called the same species.
We call this the process of speciation, which means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they inhale the carbon dioxide that humans expel (that is, breathe).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
We make houses out of plants and we make clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaurus was the top predator of its time so it feared nothing but its fellow mosasaurs.
Its long jaws are packed with over 70 sharp teeth, as well as extra rows of teeth at the top of its mouth, meaning that nothing can escape when it passes through its mouth.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that his tongue was branched, that his diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and that he may have been a cannibal for a long time.
It also attacks anything that enters the water, including giant dinosaurs like T. rex that can't compete with it.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans did have a few odd or unusual feasts, including wild boars, fawns, snails, and a type of rodent called a mouse.
And the rich man and the poor woman eat together, and the rich man eats together, and the rich man eats together, and the rich man eats together, and the poor man eats together, and the rich man eats together, and the poor man eats together.
Ancient Roman food could not bring the foods that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or chocolate, and no ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple to each of their gods, which was considered the house of the nation's gods.
Citizens would bring offerings to the gods and the priests would try to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and a sanctuary inside that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes a special pyramid-shaped tower, called a ziggurat, was built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm Middle Eastern climate, home is not so important.
Most Jewish family life takes place in the open.
Women cooked in the courtyard, shops were just open counters facing the street.
There is no large forest in the Land of Canaan, which is why the price of timber is so high.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west found Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, despite his findings, the Eskimos were living there at the time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might think the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although it has a writing on the back, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence is written "The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document in reverse".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote them, it is known that in early times large parchment documents (measuring 29⁄4 inches by 24 1⁄2 inches) were rolled up for safekeeping.
So, the notation was most likely inserted as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part was still not free.
"The region was ruled by the Vichy French, who were the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the occupiers instead of fighting them".
"The Allies invaded southern France on August 15, 1940, this invasion was dubbed "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned on Germany.
A civilization is a single culture run together by a group of people who live and work together, as a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and is also the measure of the size of a society.
City states are the precursors of nations. Civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge over several generations, the remaining cultural traces, and the reasonable spread.
Minority cultures typically disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as a viable civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress has no power to levy taxes. Since there is no national executive or judicial branch, Congress relies on the state authorities, who are often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
Nor does it have the authority to set aside interstate tax and tariff regulations.
These articles require the unanimous consent of all the states before they can be changed, while the states ignore the central government so their representatives are often absent.
The Italian national football team, as well as the German national football team, are the second most successful team in the world and were the winners of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, bicycle racing, ice hockey, field hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern region, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
The Japanese have almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu) making Japan the 7th largest island in the world
"As a result of the cluster of islands that Japan has, Japan in geographical terms is often referred to as the "islands"
Taiwan's origins go back to the 15th century when European seamen who passed by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southern Taiwan, and initiated a transformation in local grain production practices and employed Chinese laborers to work in its rice paddies and plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists have a better idea of what the original looks like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is then said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS format group) are equivalent to or close to this aspect ratio.
The most frequently violated and underestimated rule of thirds is the simple guide that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
It is said that the most effective place for such a main subject is the intersection of the lines that separate the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During the historical period in Europe, the Catholic Church (which became rich and powerful) was closely monitored.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European nations despite their differences in language and customs.
Its all-pervasive power influences everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the principles of Christian teaching is that wealth should be used to overcome suffering and poverty.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this centralization of power and money has caused many to question whether this teaching has been fulfilled.
As soon as hostilities broke out, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties over the last two centuries.
Britain set up mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering all parts of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, the Germans suspected a similar response in the unrelenting submarine battles.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, many nations resolved to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of indicating different periods of time; each stage in China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
In addition, at the interval of each dynasty there was a period of instability of the divided provinces. The most popular of these is the epic of the Three Kingdoms which took place at the 60-year interval between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars were fought between the nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political impacts such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolute rule to republican rule, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Moreover, after the revolution, job openings were opened to all male applicants, opening up opportunities for the most ambitious to succeed.
The same goes for the military because instead of ranking soldiers based on class, they're now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class citizens from other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this worldly life. He often visited the cave later known as 'Hira '" on Mount 'Nur (light) to meditate".
His self-imposed confinement, which endures through time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on the top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, this place is not easy to find even when one knows that this place exists.
Nothing was visible except the clear sky above and the surrounding mountains, and very little could be seen or heard from this cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramidal structures erected in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
"The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead has several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and a magnificent Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
"The "up arcs" look like the letter V and the "down arcs" like staples or squares that don't have a bottom".
Up means you have to start at the end and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Upward friction usually produces a softer sound, while downward friction is stronger and more firm.
Feel free to write your own mark, but there is a musical reason for the printed bow mark, so usually the mark must be obeyed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were on October 6, 1789 forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mass of women of the market.
In a carriage, they journey back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowds forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At one point, one of the mob members waved the heads of the royal guards killed at Versailles in front of the frightened Queen.
The US imperialist war expenditure in conquering the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to finance the bulk of the expenditures and interest on the bonds floating on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
The profits made from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people are of course the basic advantage of US imperialism.
To understand the Kenisha, one must understand the context that drove the creation of the order.
The High Middle Ages are the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The High Middle Ages extended from the Early Middle Ages to the Late Middle Ages, ending around 1500 by convention.
Technological determinism is a term whose practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the impulse of technology or technological necessity to the strict notion that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic associated with scientific law and its technological manifestations.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism contain two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology ultimately has an inherent "effect" on society, rather than being merely socially conditioned".
For example, one might say that cars should lead to the development of highways.
Nevertheless, the national highway network was not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars also led to high rates of road accidents, which led to the discovery of new techniques in the medical world to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had considerable elements of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time the customs and cultures associated with that geography emerged, and these, in harmony with the place of society, were preferable to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is known as the contemporary fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury lasted from about 400 to about 1100.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, especially as the Crusaders returned with gifts of silk and spices worth more than the Byzantine market offered.
It was at this time that the title of the Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and into the 14th century.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, the western style could be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, western Europeans began to develop their own style. One of the biggest developments of the time was the result of the Crusades, people began to wear buttons to tighten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce enough food to meet the needs of farmers and their families.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually organic, and uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with rotational cultivation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers engaged in agricultural self-sufficiency and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that distinguish one subculture from another may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture typically mark their membership through the use of distinctive and symbolic styles, among them fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take advantage of some unfortunate cases of children who, because of neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, are not socialized by adults as they grow up.
"Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this child abandonment is due to the parent's rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical impairment".
Wild children may have experienced abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some people say they have lived in the wild themselves.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, wildlings exhibit behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely like that of certain animals that care for them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Whereas project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a support tool that provides support to individuals who are undergoing new learning experiences such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and physical, in other words, a teacher is a scaffolding but so is a tiny paper clipper character in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scales are internalized in software and are intended to question, encourage, and explain procedures that might be too challenging for students to solve on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
Children should not be raised in a environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educating, but that's the way it is.
We consider the foster care system a safe zone for these children.
Our childcare system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care.
Care should provide all the needs that are not present in the home where they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The special characteristics of the Internet lead to an additional dimension in terms of use and approach to gratification.
"For example, 'learning' and 'socializing' are suggested as important motivations in Internet use (James et al., 1995). "
"Personal engagement" and "continuous connection" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites".
The use of video recorders led to the important discovery of the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements, that occur in a matter of milliseconds.
Specifically, it states that we can detect whether someone is lying by observing their microexpressions correctly.
In his paper entitled The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how a person who cannot understand speech because of brain damage is still able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggested that the ability to interpret such human behavior might be possessed by animals such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research showed that there are two genetic variants: hidden and revealed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the group of expression variations.
Segregation and recombination stir up the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for primates with a digestive system like humans to meet their amino acid needs from available plant sources.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences, namely, growth depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant source of protein is the leaf and the nut, but it's hard for primates like us to digest unless it's cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termit, egg) are not only easy to digest, but also provide high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
"All things considered, we should not be surprised that our ancestors coped with the 'protein problem' in a manner almost similar to the chimpanzees on the savannah today".
Sleep disturbance is the process of you intentionally waking up during a normal sleep period, then falling asleep a few moments later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to keep you awake without fully awakening you.
If you reset the clock while you're sleeping, then the clock can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to stand up and turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option involves drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing people to wake up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is correlated to the inverse of the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive life force there is, and everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that's holding us back is our own negative tension and nature.
Tibetan Buddhism took the foundation of the Buddhist teachings, but then expanded it with a focus on mahayana love and with many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it's based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of love for all.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightened energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, spells, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the God Yoga. Through visualization of the various gods the energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which resulted in cooperation between the Soviet Union and the U.S. With the end of the war and the conflict systems, processes, and cultures resulted in the collapse of the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies now became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought in the flesh, by proxy forces, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were broken, and the only hope was to retreat and re-establish itself along the Romanian bridge.
However, this plan became obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian guard after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods has so far been the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
Naval service is traditionally about ensuring that your country is able to maintain its ability to move people and goods, and at the same time, impeding your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most important and recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in WWII, where the Americans tried to move troops and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy, which mostly used U-boats, once tried to prevent this congestion.
If the Allies fail, Germany may be able to conquer Britain as it has done with the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise goats for their milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats tend to be used by children or adults, similar to the more familiar herding methods of the shepherds, and these herding methods are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the tracks consisted of only parallel wooden planks, the horses could pull the carriages more tightly and pull more loads than the slightly rougher roads at the same time.
Rail pads were introduced early on to hold tracks in place, but it was slowly realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a layer of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused the wooden wheels on the trains to break more quickly.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first rails made entirely of iron were born.
The first known means of transportation was walking, and with the emergence of Homo erectus two million years ago, humans began to walk upright.
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as it normally does.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithcus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce the impact of our actions in the future.
It's like symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we have to find the root of the problem, and we have to deactivate it.
It is quite clear that the world is developing because of science and technology, and the overpopulation and the wasteful human lifestyle is becoming quite a big problem.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was taken several blocks to John Dunlap's printing shop.
"Overnight about 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as the 'Dunlap broadsides".
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25th Dunlap leaflet known to exist is the oldest surviving copy of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
Many people don't think that they're dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
Yet, there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk with two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be seen in the presence of an open storage of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to a specific toxin.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term comes from a past acquaintance with the louse, which is an insect that is extremely adaptable as a parasite on humans.
Both the Killer Goat and the Cassowary Moth are nidicolous animals, adapted to living in their nests or homes.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 registered cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, the spinal nerves and the optic nerves.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is in their own best interests, or in the best interests of their children, to raise a child.
This couple can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the birth parents withdraw their custody so that another couple can take custody of the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method, which actually guides most scientific research.
It's not alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations as well as guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and specifically on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, have been accepted.
As interest in Greek knowledge waned, the West found that they were being drawn from Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Much of the attention to rhythm in physiology and behavior often depends on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been recorded for most living things, including fungi, bacteria, animals, and plants.
The biological jam is a self-contained oscillator that will continue the period of the cycle running freely even when no external cues are present.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first major proposals to say that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used a phage, or virus, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They've done two experiments, which is to tag the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus and tag the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of a mutation can vary, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cell is a germ lineage cell.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to the child, while other mutations can result in cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people to visit natural areas to enjoy the natural scenery, including wildlife and plants.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, as well as learning information about ecosystems.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small town by car to go to their work and meet other people whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transport, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on the personal car.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has freed the biosphere from one of its stable states that for the past two million years has supported human evolution.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaint about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do these complaints about the transportation system, why do they always fail, are the transportation engineers incompetent, or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they create with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within reasonably consistent ranges; therefore, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and are more or less mathematically representable.
To better represent traffic flows, the relationships between three main characteristics have been established: (1) track, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps in the planning, design, and operation of highway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to travel in space, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings parallel to their bodies.
This gives them more options for small-scale hiding from predators.
Currently, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and dragonflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some think he is right, but many believe otherwise; the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars) moves around the earth.
It makes sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and first largest river on Earth, carrying eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the largest river in the world, with a width of about 5.5 miles [9.6 km].
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the various rivers into the oceans of the planet comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 miles) long, and it receives water from thousands of tributaries.
Although the building of pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and perfection of the engineering of the construction of the Giza pyramids was never surpassed.
The ancient New Kingdom of Egypt admired the monuments of its predecessors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of the people who work in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because all of these can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easily mined with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all things are made of a mixture of one or more of four elements, namely, earth, water, air, and fire.
It's more like the four properties of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Basically, an alloy is a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are metals, and of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of an atom is so incredibly small that a dot at the end of this sentence could contain several trillion atoms.
When it came out, pencils were a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil's status and use have been degraded.
People now write messages on a computer screen, never having to use a handshake.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will be when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to form an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the nucleus again and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means that atoms tend to break apart with little or no contact.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the farthest side.
It's thinner under the maria and thicker under the plateaus.
There's probably more dark areas on the near side because the crust is thinner, so it's easier to get to the surface.
Satisfaction theory centers on finding out what moves people or what interests them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they grow into adulthood.
It analyzes the characteristics of people that make them want something, and the factors in the environment that make them do or not do certain things.
Two of the most famous load theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
"In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues: One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the people" (or woman)".
Such managers have difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, someone turns into an unrecognizable individual, who feels he has to change everything the team has done and do it alone.
In the end, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often results in a rift between the leader and the team members.
Virtual teams have the same standard of excellence as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Members of a virtual team often serve as a point of contact for their live physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
"The presence of a real 'stealth team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, page 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".
The "stealth team" is the management team where each member reports. The "invisible team" sets the standards for each member.
Why would organizations want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization?
When all available resources are used effectively across all the functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can take place.
As a result, the processes of an organization working together to solve a problem can give rise to new innovative processes to serve the needs of customers.
Before organizations can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as sharing organizational knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognitive inquiry, and therefore narrow the area of research and make it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's long been known that brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior changes and some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes of the brain that have never been seen before.
It gives us a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning and adaptation of intelligence in machines.
Research in artificial intelligence involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and queries, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
This sort of thing has become a separate discipline, which focuses on providing solutions to real problems in life.
AI systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as they have been built into some home computer applications and video game software.
Tours are an important part of school life, and often a teacher will gladly take his students to places where they cannot use the bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual tours, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing travel works virtually is also a great way to reflect on travel and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, each year the website is redesigned, but the old version is kept online to serve as a sticky book.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While students typically begin the experience of blogging with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience in general changes that.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, bloggers began to work on improving the quality of their writing to avoid criticism.
"In addition, blogs also "force students to be more literate about the world around them". The urgency to satisfy the audience inspires students to be resourceful and interesting (Toto, 2004)."
Blogs are tools that inspire collaboration, and encourage students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school.
"Proper use of blogs "can empower learners to be more analytical and critical: by actively responding to online material, learners can define their position in the context of other writings and also outline their opinions on a range of issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and is home to a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Far to the south is Niagara Falls and to the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and its surroundings.
All of these things and a variety of other things have made Ontario what outsiders consider to be essentially Canadian.
Large areas in the north are very sparsely populated and some are even virtually uninhabitable wilderness.
Here's a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the U.S. than in Canada.
The East African Archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and most isolated continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or associated with France and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, then flourished in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
It is bordered on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Female travelers are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
If you also wear a ring it will be very helpful (do not let it look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can result in what they perceive as abuse and not infrequently this is followed by a clutch in the arm, etc.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and don't be afraid to defend your opinions (cultural differences or not, doesn't mean they're permissible!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya. The city was later renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan items, such as tagine, pottery, leather goods, hookah pipes, and various geegaws, but all of this is reserved for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the extreme eastern region near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside Goma should be researched to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu Province.
The city is also the base for the Nyiragongo volcano as well as some of the cheapest treks to look for tracks of the Mountain Gorillas in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (ojek) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Franc for a short trip.
"In view of its relatively inaccessible location, 'Timbuktu' has been used as a metaphor for an exotic and distant land".
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, Timbuktu was placed on the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
The site was one of the main stops on the PBS special, Wonders of the World Africa by Henry Louis Gates.
It's a stark contrast to other cities in the country, because it's more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (TNK) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Buaya River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's premier attractions and is considered the mainstay of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, it imposes daily entry and conservation fees.
It may also be advantageous for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which gives access to a select few parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the origin of the name of the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists consider as the main focus.
The row of buildings that make Hong Kong's skyline resemble a shimmering bar chart is further illustrated by its reflection on Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon beach across the river.
Much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is crammed into the reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is the place that the British colonists took as their own and if you're looking for evidence of colonial territories in the past, this is the right place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest belt of coastal mangroves, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forested part of the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forest is not just a mangrove swamp - it also includes some of the trees still standing in the great forests that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered in water/wetland.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a haven for wildlife, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus terminal (across the river) throughout the day, though most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Inter-district buses are usually full, so it is best to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, comfortable, and rugged Japanese Coaster Buses.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River between the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de I'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters tall, 378 meters long and have two 3.50 m wide lanes.
The vertical space under the bridge is 15 metres long, and was completed in August 2011, opening to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational by September 2017, when the planned Brazilian customs checkpoint will be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous groups such as the GuaycurÃo and PayaguÃ¡, who survive by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
"In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Province of the Indians", was born as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquistadors with the indigenous groups".
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known to have one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about the tournament and where to buy tickets for the polo match, visit Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP) whose value is set at the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere throughout the island, in the city of Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also commonly accepted.
In remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted.
Exchanging Falklands currency outside the island is almost impossible, so change it before you leave the island.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, summer there coincides with winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are common.
Winters can be extremely cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity make it feel colder than the numbers on the thermometer.
"There is no 'rainy' or 'dry' season: the amount of rainfall is almost always the same throughout the year".
Although most of the animals in the park are accustomed to human encounters, the wildlife remains wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, keep at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards from other wild animals.
No matter how small they may appear, bison, deer, elk, bears, and almost any other large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance.
Also, be aware that the smell attracts the attention of bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly food and keep the tent clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was discovered in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a famous naval stalemate in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and the UK refused to leave the harbour.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle run by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city culminated in the assassination of its key leader: Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's position covering two harbours, the most popular of which are in three regions.
The North Shore (included in the North Harbour district) is located on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy with safe swimming areas, and most have shade obtained from rows of pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes family-filled beaches with nice shops lined up along the shore.
"The main local beer is 'Number One', it is not a complex beer, but a pleasant and refreshing one. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are plenty of French wines to be had, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better for travel.
Local tap water is very safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're afraid.
For Australians, the concept of a 'flat white' coffee is a foreign one. Black coffee is espresso, cappuccino comes with a high cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, expensive fruit juice but delicious.
Many tours to the reef take place year-round, and accidents on the reef are very rare.
Nevertheless, listen to the advice of the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish appeared near the coast and near the estuary from October to April above 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
The saltwater crocodile is an inactive marine species, its primary habitat being the estuary north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind because they are sure they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although you can book other forms of accommodation, such as camping grounds, through travel agents.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even a combined flight and hotel package.
They can also reserve a reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your purpose (e.g. a visa).
Any changes or requests must be arranged through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most music festival participants decide to camp on-site, and most visitors consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be near the show, then you have to come early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage has ended, there is a part of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have a camping area reserved for families with young children.
If you are visiting the North Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, because the noise is exceptional when crossing the ice, especially for those who are most affected.
The Saint Petersburg cruise ship includes time in the city.
Casinos usually make great efforts to optimize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special offerings of food, drink, and entertainment, to keep the mood of the guests, and to keep them on site.
Some establishments offer free alcohol, but drunkenness is a mental disorder, and all serious gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive in high latitudes or across mountainous terrain needs to take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On the freeway, it's slippery and snowy, the friction is low and you can't drive like on a regular asphalt.
During a snowstorm, you can get caught in the snow that falls quickly.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blown snow, or by condensation or ice in vehicle windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy conditions are normal in many countries and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
The safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The popular term safari refers to a land journey to see spectacular African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes tend to get close to cars, so standard equipment already allows for good observations.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes do not want to be seen and can be seen better with binoculars.
"A walking safari (also called a "hike in the bush", "hiking safari", or a "hike") involves hiking, either for a few hours or for several days".
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some sporting events will be held in a number of other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, after the first in 1964.
If you book flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay is announced, you may be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies have not been extended until July 2020, when the Olympics have been scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, while regular tickets will cost about ¥7,000.
Many hotels have ironing boards and ironing boards available for rent, even if they are not available in the room.
If ironing is not available or you do not want to wear ironing socks, you can use a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric overheat (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burning).
There are a variety of ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, a minute's boiling of water is considered sufficient, while in others it may take several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are concerned, consider buying water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they do not recognize in their hometown.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or in more severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins or transmit disease.
Self-infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans with their power, are not usually included in the category of pests.
Shopping at duty-free shops is an opportunity to buy goods that are tax- and duty-free in a number of locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save money on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The intersection between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often passes through remote inland areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: there are many steep slopes, narrow roads, and sharp turns.
The existing speed limits are lower than the previous and subsequent sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and it is important to adhere to them strictly rather than the other way around.
Although, oddly, cell service is stronger here than anywhere else along this route, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German dry cakes are quite delicious, and in Bavaria the cakes are quite rich and varied, similar to their southern neighbour, Austria.
Dried fruit cakes are common, with apples being cooked into a dry cake all year round, and then there are the cherries and plums that come in the summer.
Many German roasts also serve almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you want a small but rich cake, try between Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region where you are.
Curry is a dish consisting of spices and seasonings, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
"Curry can be dry or wet, depending on the amount of liquid".
In the interior of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry dishes. In South India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, yogurt is more commonly used.
There are 17,000 islands to choose from, though Indonesian food is a general term that represents the diverse regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further qualification, the term tends to mean food originating from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago, serving a variety of simple spicy dishes. The main spices of Javanese taste are ground beans, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The saddle is a support for the driver's foot that hangs on the side of any saddle.
It provides greater stability for the rider, but potentially poses safety issues due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck in it.
To minimize the risk, a number of safety precautions are in place to prevent a rider from being thrown off a horse but having his foot caught in the bridle.
First, most drivers wear driving boots with slender, narrow heels and soles.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially British saddles, have safety bars that allow the saddle's skin to fall off the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
In the heart of South America's Yosemite, Chile's premier climbing destination, the Cochama Valley, is home to a series of cliffs and gigantic granite rock walls.
Climbers from all over the world continue to create new routes between the walls' limitless potential.
The sport of downhill skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves skiing on snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
"Skiing has become the main travel activity of many enthusiasts who are sometimes called 'ski bums,' people who plan entire holidays around skiing in a particular location".
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The sport of downhill skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also called backpacking, ski touring, or ski climbing.
It is related but usually unrelated to ski tours or alpine-style climbing, the latter done on steep terrain and requiring much sturdier boots and skis.
