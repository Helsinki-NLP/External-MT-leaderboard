A black box in your car?
While American road designers are struggling to find money to repair a decaying highway network, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black box that can easily fit into the dashboard of your car.
The facilities that track every mile a motorist runs and transmit this information to the authorities are at the heart of the controversial efforts by Washington and the State Planning Office to renovate the outdated U.S. highway financing system.
Usually, the elaborate design of highways has suddenly sparked intense debate and the emergence of various associations.
Libertarians have been meeting with environmental groups and lobbying for the government to use these little cabinets that would record the miles you've travelled and maybe where you're going  and then use that information to compile a tax return.
The tea party's scared.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy concerns.
And while Congress cannot agree on whether to proceed, some states are not waiting for anything.
They're figuring out how they can move to a system where the driver pays for a kilometer of the road he's on in the next decade.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
"This is not a matter of choice", said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California State Administration Association, which plans to start tracking the mileage of every California motorist by 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This is what this technology is for.
The motivation is the fact that the Road Trust Fund, funded by the taxes Americans pay at gas stations, is at its bottom.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars run a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents a gallon, has not increased in the last 20 years.
Because of the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax even by a single cent.
"The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable", said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed a tracking device in 500 cars to test this mileage system.
"In the long run, it seems like the most logical alternative", he said.
Experts call it a user fee based on the number of miles traveled.
It is no surprise that this idea is popular with urban liberals, as taxes can be used to change the patterns of drivers' behavior, which can help, for example, reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions.
California designers look to this system when planning strategies to meet the goals set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most functional long-term alternative.
Free market representatives from the Reason Foundation are also inclined to the idea that drivers will pay for miles covered.
"It's not a tax that disappears in a black hole", said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. transportation ministers who urged Congress in 2011 to move toward paying for a mile.
The U.S. Senate last year approved a $90 million pilot project that would include about 10,000 cars.
However, the House of Representatives rejected the proposal, citing concerns from rural legislators representing the population, whose daily lives often involve working many miles outside the city.
However, some states and cities are moving forward on their own.
The most violent is Oregon, which involved 5,000 drivers in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon start paying the state a mileage tax instead of a gas tax.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is currently investigating the project.
Illinois is only trying to do that to a limited extent on trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state transportation departments, along with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) is looking at how they can implement this change.
But this concept has no supporters.
In Nevada, where the facility recently housed about 50 volunteer cars, drivers were concerned that the government was able to track their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother and similar issues were a big problem", said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategy and operations management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the pilot project continued, the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be very easy to turn this facility into a full-fledged surveillance facility".
There is no need to build a huge technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to record the daily departures and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is one of the few states that is trying to find technology that would allow the state to track how many miles a car goes, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
The pursuit of such technology has led some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage.
This company was not originally involved in the government's tax assistance.
It wanted to break through the emerging liability insurance market where drivers would pay based on how much they drive.
But this device they're testing is attracting the attention of road network designers because it doesn't use GPS and it only delivers a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using a modem.
"People will be more willing to go if you don't track their speed and location", says Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
A number of major errors have occurred in some of these pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less cumbersome ways to do that.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they don't have to take any equipment and instead choose to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles traveled by all the people in the state.
Elsewhere, they hope that the vigilant public will respond to this concept if the device can do more, not less.
In New York City, transportation officials are working to develop a tax system that would also allow parking fees, cover mileage, and collect speed data from other drivers so that motorists can avoid traffic jams.
Motorists will be willing to participate because of the value of the benefits they are offered, says the city's projection document.
Some transportation designers, however, would like to know whether all the discussions about paying per mile are not just a huge substitute problem.
Officials at the Metropolitan San Francisco Bay Transportation Commission say Congress could easily solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising the gas tax.
A one-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not require much fuel and thus pay a fair share.
"No radical surgery is necessary when you take aspirin in abundance", said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot of other things.
The CSSD is negotiated by the Sabotka.
Social democracy is rolling, people and grandparents are talking to each other and planning a common process.
If the Social Democrats are fit within a few weeks, they will meet at the negotiating table with perfectly matched partners who will put on the table a list of requirements, including ministerial posts.
The CSSD envoys will either swallow the sour grapes of the coalition or shake hands with the rambling minority government.
After four days of being carried by a wave of sympathy, Bohuslav Sabotka struck for the first time.
Yesterday, he failed to control the political clout and, most importantly, to force convicted liars to resign.
He is the only confirmed negotiator for the party, and the other team members will be allowed to attend the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CEC).
I apologized to the members of the guild and now to the citizens.
You can't lie in private or in public.
"It was a mistake", said the Social Democratic leader, Michel Hashek, after the meeting.
He added that he was not a candidate for the position of First Vice President.
"I will announce my decision on 10 November at the UAV", said Hashek.
The Vice-President of the CFSP, Zdeněk Škromach, and the head of the parliamentary club, Jeronym Tejc, also spoke.
But he noted that he was elected just two days ago.
Both deputies then declared that they would do everything to ensure that the 50-member club of the CZSSD sounded by one vote.
The absurd theater was crowned by Michal Hashek with the phrase: "I have been a member of the CZSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I have respected the decisions of the party authorities".
That's another lie in the live feed.
Or did he forget that the August CCP voted 57 percent that Bohuslav Sobotka was the party's candidate for prime minister?
However, the head of the CSSD, by the call of the CVD, only made a powerful army of enemies until next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood the 192 members of the body's e-mails and media with a barrage of gossip and rumors, possibly reminding them of the real mistakes of Sobotkov's political career.
The dirty clothes will be woven vigorously, and there will be signs of a dark alliance between the Uglobaron, the Day of the Bacala, and the Wing of the Sabbath.
The friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer of the Humility Council will be discussed.
Disputes have erupted in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organisation of the CFSP.
The words of Peter Kajnar, the Ostrov's chief and Sobotko's ally, warn us: "I signed Charter 77 so that the country would not be ruled by idiots".
If the U.N.C. had met earlier this weekend, I think the liars would have been forced to ritually sacrifice their functions.
The traitors will shove their heads in ashes and stay.
And the current winning head of the CSSR will end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Dr. Martin on the problems with OH in Sochi: Communication with Russians is difficult
The corners of his mouth indicate a slight smile, and then he breathes out, "It's difficult".
Cooperating with the organizing team for the 2014 Sochi Olympics is a little more complicated, according to Martin Dr.
We can forget about what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same way", says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things work slower and not so exactly.
It's so confusing.
In terms of invoices, they are relatively fast, not so much in terms of providing information about essential things.
For three months now, we've been asking them to give us a list of how the villages will be officially designated so we can do a lot of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating the thing.
They're still communicating about a lot of things.
Is the Olympic Village at least built?
But it's not a disaster anymore.
A month ago, we were walking around empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What do you mean, they're empty?
Do you need any finished floors?
Just the basic concrete, so that's what it was like a month ago.
But they still have time.
Although there is a danger that when we arrive on January 26th as a front, there will still be a smell of glue.
And if they don't, what will?
President Putin would you think is driving the army there?
That's what I think is going to happen.
Just so it's not that Olympic Village is a pleasure village.
They're more likely to miss the roadmap, the details.
Maybe they'll have roads in such a state that we'll have to bring the London Games girls with us.
But I believe they're gonna put it together.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78, although the number changes depending on the nomination criteria.
Maybe the Krabsbrushers will go in the three they've gone out.
No one can doubt the speed skater Martin Sáblíková, but otherwise it's in development.
Are you still on your way to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should not fly there until January 26th.
We know what the houses in the Olympic Village will look like.
We even measured some things ourselves on the meter so we wouldn't just believe the drawings.
We're also preparing a whole host of other things, including transportation.
And what's the head of the mission doing a hundred days before the Olympics?
I'm preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports, plus I'm making a regular agenda in terms of communication with the Sochi organizing committee.
Putin promised an ecological Olympics, he's got a big secret landfill in his plan.
Fans of winter sports are already trimming the meters for the opening of the Sochi Olympics, while others are looking more and more anxiously at their preparations.
The Russian Olympics, although they won't start until February, are facing another scandal.
The Russians seem unable to keep their promise that the preparation and holding of the Games will not in the slightest disturb the nature of the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will be heading in four months.
After the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians built a very high lattice, and the Canadian Olympic Games became the most environmentally friendly in history.
But it seems that Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to clean up the "zero waste" game has long since taken hold.
AP reporters last week discovered a giant dump of building materials in the village of Achštyr near Sochi.
So a dump full of building materials, tires, cans and insulation foam was found by environmentalists in August, and they immediately reported it.
The Russian authorities have been rocked and the landfill has disappeared.
Just for a little while.
Last week, reporters got a glimpse of a dump the size of three football fields.
Not only is there a few such sites in the area, the British newspaper The Times described.
The Russian Railways, a state monopoly, is building a 60-kilometer road between Sochi airport and the sports resort.
The company, which has already swallowed 280 billion rubles, was led by one of Putin's close associates, Vladimir Yakunin.
In August, the railroad denied that the landfill was being set up by a subcontractor.
The locals are already desperate.
According to the residents of Ashtair, trucks full of waste have been driving around the village day and night for three months.
Experts say the waste is threatening to contaminate the local Mzymt River, other streams, and eventually the Black Sea.
"Water from here will contaminate the water sources of Sikka for the next ten to fifteen years", said Vladimir Kimaev of the environmental nonprofit EWNC.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem of the Russian organizing committee and government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
By comparison, the Sochi Games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing will cost $43 billion.
Last year's London Games cost only $19 billion and the Vancouver Games cost only $9 billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns about whether there will be enough snow, there have also been reports of human rights violations in the construction of sports venues and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers closed his mouth to protest that he didn't get paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers are coping with a new law banning the promotion of homosexuality during the games.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
A young couple is grown up to live with their parents, a new house offers privacy to both generations
Japanese studio Tai and Associates was assigned to design a house on a plot of land that is located on a corner of two streets, with the land itself somewhat sloping.
The request also stated that two generations would like to live together in the house, but each should have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple needed a small office.
The house is on a corner of two streets and a slightly sloping lot.
So the architects decided to put every household on one floor of the house.
"In making the design, we respected family ties, history and memories associated with the place".
"The three different functions of the house are connected by several paths through the exterior of the building, so that everyone is aware of the presence of others, but at the same time has his privacy", explain the designers.
The parents' home is a garden with an old pine tree, which is revered by family traditions and memories.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, as the facade differs in its final design.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was formed using panel panels, the part where the office is whitewashed and the remaining elements remained in a clean concrete design without further modifications.
Many of the walls of the house are completely glazed, which makes the interior of the house very much connected to the exterior.
The parents' home, the kitchen, the dining room, and the living room, surround a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
The interior and exterior are connected by a side wall that starts in the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in a young couple's home.
A young couple enters the house through the main hallway and then climbs the stairs to their rooms.
The stairs are the main dominant part of the interior of the house.
Their design allows for a lot of natural light to pass through them in a cascading fashion.
That's what architects were trying to do to distinguish the house from the others and to print something unique.
The young couple's home is treated as one open space with a kitchen, dining room and living room together.
Only a glass wall with sliding doors separates it from the terrace.

The second floor is composed as one large open space that freely crosses onto the terrace, from which there is a beautiful view of Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the top floor is captured in a pure combination of white and black.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
A young couple enters the house through the main entrance, finds themselves in the lobby, and then climbs up the stairs.
Defend academic freedom, as is true for the Zeman and the ODS.
I have repeatedly in recent months called in open letters on students, teachers and high school and college administrators in several counties to defend academic freedoms from the election campaign that President Miloš Zeman was waging in schools.
I've met with more or less success.
The rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused the lecture of the honorary chairman of SPOZ - Zemanovci in the run-up to the election, was even retaliated for not being invited to celebrate the state holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of the school representatives who were no longer so brave and allowed Miloš Zeman to visit: Technical University in Brno, Gymnázium Hladnov in Ostrava, Business School in Ostrava, Commercial Academy in Cologne, J.E. Purkyně University in Ústí nad Labem.
Now we're meeting with the continuing policy-making in the Pardubics.
The newly elected MP for the ODS, the Dean of the Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic post and moreover, he thinks it's normal.
Professor, it's really not the same as staying in a small town, for example.
You want to be a member of the SSR's heightmen, who are both MP and heightman, and they are both working their jobs?
You're telling people that you can handle both of these challenging functions on the left back.
I know, we have an example of Michael Hash, who can even handle dozens of functions at once.
But I guess that's not exactly an example of the person you should be following.
We also find the opposite and a positive example of MUDr.
But the main reason I recommend you leave the dean's office is that you are violating the apolitical nature of the academic grounds of the University of Pardubice.
The Pardubican ODS leadership sees your current position in both positions as an advantage to the University.
But you can help your school without being a dean.
I think the same opinion as I have and the rector Miroslav Ludwig, your students will have.
So consider your retirement and keep your face.
Otherwise, you may be told that the voters will count on you in the next election.
And it doesn't have to be long.
In Kunovica, the bubbles are coconut, they don't add chemicals to it.
Over a thousand tonnes of sour cabbage are planned to be produced in the coming months in Slovakia's Kunovica Fruit, which belongs to the Hame food group.
The season here started in October and will last about six months.
He's been making healthy food here since 1925 in a traditional way, stepping right into the big dances.
In the modern industrial age, it's a rarity.
Our workers will be taking a shift of almost a decade.
Each of the ten tanks can hold 15 to 30 tons of cabbage, and one takes three shifts to fill", said Slovak Fruta's director David Kladroba.
The cabbage heads are transported to the company premises directly from their fields by farmers mainly from Ostrožska and Břeclavska.
Fruit's employees then clean the vegetables, remove the brakes, and throw them in a ball.
From there, the already cut cabbage falls into pools six feet deep, where white-clothed women and young women work tirelessly.
It's a way to get out of the air.
The last layer of cabbage is covered with a sheet and loaded with water.
"The green turtle then matures for six to eight weeks by spontaneous fermentation without any additions of fermentation-promoting substances", stressed the director of the Cladrob.
The natural process is equivalent to domestic production, with layers of workers pouring salt and vinegar.
The seeds are then distilled and transported to the filling line.
It is packed in a sweet-sour spray into bags or glasses and sterilized.
Hamé supplies sour cabbage mainly to the domestic and Slovak markets.
Interest is also being registered in some other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to cooperate with Germany in connection with the US surveillance.
Edward Snowden, a US intelligence agent, has announced that he is willing to go to Berlin to deliver evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander are unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
On Thursday, German lawmaker Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he was granted asylum, and discussed the possibility of witnessing in Germany.
In a letter from Mr Snowden, which the MP delivered to the media in Berlin on Friday, he said: "While the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat the opposition as refugees and to try to criminalize political speech with heavy lawsuits that do not give room for defence".
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In that letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that support from the international community could persuade the United States government to drop the criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the United States Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German Interior Minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will find a way to allow it".
Tensions between the United States and Germany began to rise when allegations emerged that the NSA was wiretapping Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of Parliament who leads the parliamentary intelligence panel, said that if there was any opportunity to question Mr Snowden as a witness without putting himself at risk and completely destroying relations with the United States, it should be done.
Mr. Sträbele, a member of parliament for the German Green Party, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
He was accompanied on his trip to Russia by two German journalists.
Mr. Sträbele said that according to the former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he ever left.
If Mr. Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be safe there, said a member of parliament.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a harsh and persistent campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
But he said the world's reaction to his act of political expression gave him courage.
Citizens across the country and senior officials  including those in the United States  have evaluated the revelation of an unjustifiable system of ubiquitous surveillance for the public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities until the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved.
We're sorry for the killing, but we're innocent, the Khmer Rouge's representatives are defending themselves.
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
Under the Khmer Rouge, which ruled from 1975 to 1979 on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism, more than three million Cambodians, or at least a quarter of the population, died of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture, and execution.
This infamous S-21 prison commander was sentenced to life imprisonment by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they were acting in the best interest of the nation and had no idea what the real extent of the killing was.
"It's easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything and then intervened and corrected the situation", Khieu Samphan said in court on Thursday.
You really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no authority", he added.
Nuon Chea said he never ordered the Khmer Rouge personnel to "treat or kill people, deny them food or commit genocide".
But he admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, the victims, their families, the entire Cambodian people", he said.
The 50-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost 11 relatives under the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP she could not accept Nuon Chea's apology".
"He lied to us".
"He just wants to be forgiven".
"She doesn't care about the other", she said.
"If he hadn't given orders, his subjects wouldn't have been killed", she added, adding that the leaders of the Khmer Rouge are "worse than monsters".
The court was also to be represented by the "foreign minister" of the Khmer Rouge regime, Ieng Sary, who died in March this year.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, was found unfit to stand trial in September 2012 for dementia.
The leader of the Khmer Rouge, Pol Pot, died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is going to charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for carry-on luggage on board during its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a charge of up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday, they said passengers would be able to keep their entire can.
The new hand luggage charge applies to luggage in the upper storage area, so small baggage under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if the paid passengers wait until they arrive at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee should encourage travellers to take care of payment in advance.
"We don't like to charge this fee", she said.
The airlines began charging first and second baggage in 2008.
Travelers tried to avoid these charges and crammed into hand luggage hidden in the storage room as much as possible, so that space was often lacking in this space.
Charges are one way to teach passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the point of this new fee is not really to raise more money.
The point is that Frontier's most loyal customers have made it very clear that finding a place in the upper storage is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company's website will not be charged.
This means that one passenger in line at Frontier gate can bring baggage that pays nothing for, while the other passenger in line will pay $100 for the same baggage.
O'Malley said the website and the clearance procedures will be tailored to ensure that passengers are informed of the fee before they arrive at the gate.
The new fee for hand luggage will not be applicable to Frontier until before summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Travelers often complain about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
He claims that handling luggage costs money and that passengers who request this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the additional baggage charge as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of losses.
Most of them did not cover the baggage charges.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge for hand luggage three years ago and another low-cost airline, Allegiant Air, followed suit.
The only company that also has such charges is Hungarian Wizz Air, says air transport consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely monitoring the additional charges.
In its December 2011 report, it estimated that the Spirit hand luggage charge would bring in USD 50 million annually.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew with Spirit and was surprised to see what he saw at the gate when passengers encountered an unusual charge from Spirit for hand luggage.
"Jumping on a plane was the most glamorous thing I've ever seen in my flying career", he said.
I expected to see teeth grinding and fights at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, and the approach was instantaneous.
Frontier will also, following Spirit's example, charge fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice.
Frontier said passengers who receive lemonade or juice can keep the entire can and the coffee will be added free of charge.
The water will continue to be provided free of charge.
US Airways briefly tried to introduce a drink charge in 2008, but withdrew seven months later after passenger complaints and no other major airline failed.
The latest move by Frontier to charge for hand luggage unless passengers purchase a flight directly from this airline is its latest attempt to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay online travel agents like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has encouraged all airlines to guide passengers to purchase directly from them rather than through online travel agencies.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, she started giving customers who bought through an online travel agency just half a mile under a loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the mileage fee to 25 percent of the distance.
So a 1,000-mile journey with Frontier bought through an online travel agency means a $250 million reward.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make a purchase directly through the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its Denver home town, but its business is starting to crumble and it's losing money.
According to the financial results of its business partner Republic Airways Holdings on Wednesday, sales fell by 9% and transport capacity decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter.
Republic is also trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier by selling this airline.
The NSA is not blaming hackers for the downfall of the website, but an internal error.
The secret National Security Agency reported last Friday that its website went down for hours last week because of an internal flaw, not a hacker attack, as some claimed on the Internet.
"The NSA.gov website was inaccessible for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during regular updates", the intelligence agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be resolved by tonight.
The claim that the outage was caused by a DDoS attack is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server sensors detected that the NSA website had been down for at least six hours, and the site remained inaccessible to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency's internal sensitive networks were not at risk at all.
The spokesman said no classified information is compromised.
At least one group of Internet hackers claimed responsibility for disabling NSA sites through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers are loaded and the page crashes.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the point of attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA top secret agency, once nicknamed No Agency, has been the focus of public attention and bitter criticism in recent months after a string of uncoverings of foreign and domestic surveillance programs - all the product of the NSA's secretive files being seized from the agency and exposed by disillusioned former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has prompted earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier's profit fell as a result of declining supplies and orders
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier reported a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday, due to lower orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, has also not published any flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor has it offered up-to-date information on whether the aircraft will comply with its ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next September.
After the initial test flight about a month and a half ago, the aircraft flew only three times, raising the question of whether the test phase is progressing well.
The results didn't live up to the expectations, and Toronto stock fell 8 percent.
State bank analyst Cameron Doerksen lowered the rating from higher yields to sector performance on Thursday, expecting the exchange to experience a modest growth over the next quarter or two.
"While we were mostly expecting smaller aircraft deliveries, the profit margin in transport was a major disappointment", Doerksen said in a report to clients.
As the test program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect market skepticism towards this programme to increase.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will break into the bottom of the market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and, after several months of delay, it made its first flight in September.
However, the number of CSeries' binding orders is a modest 177, as potential customers are waiting for the test flight results to verify the company's claims regarding low consumption and cost savings on this transport aircraft.
At present, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a market economy investor in the Union.
The executives also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program is progressing according to plan.
The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected, Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that ground tests and software updates were planned during the takeoff.
Every manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first year and then focus on the updates, and that's what we did.
It's going to happen throughout the entire flight program.
Bombardier said the second of five test aircraft should be launched in the coming weeks and the others shortly thereafter.
Analysts are still skeptical that the first customer could start operating the CSeries 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier claims that it has evaluated its plan to put the aircraft into service and will provide updated information in the coming months.
"This slow pace of flight tests, although consistent with Bombardier's internal plan, seems to reinforce our view that the launch will be moved to the first quarter of 2015", Doerksen said.
Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, in the third quarter ending 30 September from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnover has declined marginally from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to Thomson Reuters' IBES, analysts expected a return of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer stated that it had delivered only 45 aircraft during the quarter compared to 57 aircraft a year earlier.
Net orders dropped from 83 to 26.
Unfulfilled contracts in the air division amounted to 32.9 billion as of 30 September, which is unchanged as of 31 December.
'The results in aviation were in line with our expectations, but low order intake and overall market conditions disappointed us,' said Beaudoin.
Revenue in the aviation industry fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, said revenues in this division had increased by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport contracts amounted to 32.6 billion on 30 September, a marginal increase compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by the difficulties in executing several large contracts.
The executives said that new prospects would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier shares, which also announced the arrival of Google chief financial officer Patrick Pichette, fell 8.5% to $4.83 during trading on Thursday afternoon.
Embraer SA, Brazil's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest competitor, reported a 10% quarterly profit drop on Thursday.
A cocaine addict lawyer who warned a mobster about a police investigation is in jail.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was to pass on information to the underworld king Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was worried his drug addiction would be exposed.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top lawyer who informed a drug mafia about a major police investigation, fearing that his drug addiction would be exposed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, had to hand over sensitive information to the underworld boss Neil Scarbrough after he became a suspect in cocaine smuggling.
The lawyer, nicknamed Bash (party) and hailed by criminals as the best lawyer, was arrested at his home in 2011 after police tracked down Scarborough, who he represented in previous narcotics cases.
Police saw Sarborough, 32, leaving three bags of cocaine at a law firm in Blackburn, Lancashire, at dinner with his colleagues at the Law Society.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet, and his credit cards, the investigation revealed that Ditta was a regular class A drug user.
During an eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he quietly sought information on the arrests of two men in favour of Scarborough and his accomplice.
All four suspects were being followed up at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the areas of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After police seized around £1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine and £200,000 in cash during a series of raids, 32 others were jailed alongside them.
Ditta (42) was passing information to criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction would be discovered.
Today, Ditta, who works for the Blackburn-based Forbes Solicitors, experienced a shameful moment in front of the Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty of obstructing justice in two cases after a three-week trial.
During an earlier hearing, he admitted to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer's fall came after a police investigation revealed Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and saw him putting drugs with a purity of 60 percent under a lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Scarborough then had a regular phone conversation with Ditta, who was at dinner at Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer went back to the house where he found the drugs, and there were nine interviews between the two people.
The court found that traces of Class A drugs were found in his hair, wallet and credit cards and that Ditta was a regular cocaine user.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, saying he spoke to the suspect dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation was a "confidential communication".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all withheld and hair samples were taken from him.
During a police interview, he said that he operated an office at both his home and workplace address and that clients visited him at home for work.
However, the Court heard that after key arrests, he contacted key players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, to tell them what detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "No one else knows more about the right to be free than a criminal lawyer.
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a lawyer and of having had too close a relationship with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here isn't just about a drug dealer, it's about a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the usual lawyer-client relationship.
He has been scrambling the police investigation as far as possible to allow them to continue their crimes.
Ditta did not bring a good reputation to his profession, but disrespected it.
He's been getting too close to some of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta refused the offense and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I'm not, and I wanted to give Mr. Scarborough information, I wouldn't wait 15 hours, but I would do it right away".
However, after hearing the case, Lancashire Police Inspector Lee Halstead said: "Mr Ditta himself became a criminal attorney when he started to obtain drugs from organized criminals".
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of the top organized crime groups who assigned him the task of gathering valuable information about a police investigation.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and must build public confidence and confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious Organised Crime Unit has launched an investigation into Mr Ditt, which also found him guilty of three counts of cocaine possession and now of obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing the perpetrators to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is outside the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another 35 people involved in the trafficking were jailed for a total of 153 years for drug offenses.
On his website, Ditta held an online interview about himself, saying that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death penalty in America, as a dinner guest, he would like Muhammad Ali, and as a motivation for his work, he cited inequality.
He negotiated the government with Klaus and Spedl.
Now the people of Jan Kasal have sent against Babiš.
The people won 14 MPs, or only one third of the number of Social Democrats or ANO representatives.
But they enter the government negotiations with at least one advantage.
The team that has already begun to debate the outlines of possible coalitions includes Jan Kasala - the man who popularly negotiated the terms of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
The Social Democrats and Andrey Babiš have no such matador on their side.
This time it will probably be reminiscent of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"The experience was minimal then", says Kasal, "as to how this year's talks will unfold".
Kenya's press outraged by controversial media law
It is a scary news and it is appropriate to ask what will prevent Parliament from simply violating the independence of the judiciary tomorrow, newspapers have said that the bill is unconstitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it", said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of the most well-known independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal would always be in the lead because it was an extended hand of the government and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will hear us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs", he said.
According to the Star newspaper, the bill effectively gives the government "full control over the media", and the Standard newspaper reports that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya have taken a hard hit, criticizing the bill as "serious".
The bill comes amid a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September Islamic shooter attack on the Westgate shopping centre.
The anger of the authorities was turned on by Kenyan media when they broadcast a security camera recording of soldiers sent to the scene of the attack allegedly robbing a luxury goods store.
The police chief responded by having two journalists and a media executive summoned for questioning, but the summons was later withdrawn under media pressure.
Under the new bill, media companies could be fined up to 20 million Ksh and individual journalists up to one million, with the risk of being removed from the list or denied official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the offender's property unless the fine is paid.
According to the Daily Nation, even one fine is enough to wipe out most radio stations.
It also states that these measures could have a devastating impact on what is called the Kenyan 'living blogosphere'.
Politicians know that if they keep the media quiet, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"You never know what might happen", wrote a journalist for the Nation Mutuma Mathiu, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of a system of checks and balances in public life.
"If we leave it to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and throw us back into hunting and gathering", he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to lift the national wage agency's cuts and to restore their fat wages of around 532,000 shillings a month, among the highest in the world.
They have to save money, the young Czechs know.
But most of them don't even know what the interest rate is.
More and more Czechs are putting their money away.
But they still don't make it to the regional savings champions.
Austrians save the most money, saving an average of 181 euros a month.
People in Slovakia can save a little more than the Czechs.
This is according to a survey by Erste Savings Barometer in Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of the workers improved, and two thirds of those surveyed plan to spend more money on their side.
While the Czechs are about halfway through the middle of the labor market, in Romania and Serbia, people still use very little of the savings products.
For example, a survey found that nearly every other Serb saves at home "under a pillow".
In the Netherlands, this year there has been an increase in the number of people saving more money each month.
Last year, 26 percent of respondents spent between 1,000 and 2,500 crowns each month on a variety of savings, up five percent this year.
The average monthly savings, however, have fallen slightly to 2078 crowns.
The biggest hit among savings products is pension insurance.
This is a preference of 54 percent of Czechs, whereas three years ago it was the most popular way to measure savings for only 36 percent.
Conversely, the popularity of building savings is declining, and interest in investment funds has also fallen sharply compared to last year.
It's only 16 percent of respondents, compared to almost a quarter last year.
The survey also showed that although people consider saving important, most people do not know what the returns on individual products are.
Young people under 30 do not know how their money is spent.
On the other hand, the oldest group of respondents had the best awareness of the returns of their investments, with 73 percent of respondents over 50.
In an international comparison, the Czech Republic's first-rate online banking system is used by 44 percent of the population.
Slovaks and Austrians followed with a 12 percent discount.
UN celebrates new goals for poverty
The United Nations is immediately starting work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were established 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
Prior to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which kicked off overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for the Sustainable Development Goals, which are to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Mr Ki-mun said on the eve of the summit that it was time to "stand up for national interests".
I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to implement the overall Sustainable Development Goals SDGs, he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda.
I will make every effort to fulfill the mandate given to me by the Member States and to realize our vision of the SDGs, which builds on the MDG's success.
Concerns over security in Mozambique are increasing due to conflict between strong figures
Under the statue of Samora Machela, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo to chant peace slogans for a rare public demonstration.
'We want peace back; we want stability,' said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of the investment firm.
Fearing for the future of her country, she exchanged her business clothes for a shirt with the words "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital's Independence Square.
For two weeks, almost every day, there were reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo side, some of the worst since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious insurgent movement, initially supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government in South Africa in an effort to destabilize the independent government of that country.
After a peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that an open conflict is unlikely to re-emerge in the country, but recent events have frightened foreign and local investors.
The stakes are on the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of vast coastal oil and coal reserves in the northwest could bring in over $50 billion worth of investment from companies like Brazil's Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy's Eni and American Anadarko over the next few years.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government provoked the latest conflicts by launching an attack on its members on September 17 in the province of Sofala, the traditional stronghold of Renamo.
The violent attacks by former rebels culminated when government forces attacked Renamo's party base and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakamu, the group's leader, Renamo spokesman Fernando Mazanga told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for starting the conflict because it allegedly attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to alleviate the fears of instability.
Mr Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "trotskotance" who wanted to use whatever was left of his powers to try to prove that he can dictate his own decisions to the government.
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
But concerns were raised when Mazanga's words were quoted saying Renamo was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
The FT said he meant that Frelimo's party no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to get back to negotiations, but seriously", Mr. Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the two sides have done little to ease tensions between the two sides, fueled by a series of clashes this year.
It's a wedge between two great personalities (Gubebu and Dhlakama), said Open University lecturer and Mozambican expert Joseph Hanlon.
Neither of them are good negotiators, and neither of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which has been pushing for electoral change, has already said it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a dying movement to gain benefits and financial gains from the government.
Renamo's electoral share has been declining since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by a former Renamo party member, is expected to improve its electoral position.
Mr. Mazanga says Mr. Guebuza, who is running for a second term next year, wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"The democratic system doesn't want more parties, it doesn't want transparent elections, it doesn't want peace because it doesn't want to run for president", Mazanga said.
It's unclear what options Renamo has, but it has carried out devastating terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on the key north-south road.
Most of the clashes took place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometers from the capital Maputo but is home to the city of Beira, a port on which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely for their coal exports.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway for about a week when Renamo threatened to attack the line.
Mr. Mazanga refused to comment on whether Renamo repeated its threat.
Renamo wanted to warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique was not good, Mazanga said.
"Instability has increased government frustration", says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent flood of kidnappings.
"People think that the government and the president alone are responsible for the future of the country and that he is the one who should find solutions", he says.
Demonstrator Omar Sultan says people just want stability.
"Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads", he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as models for a way of life, says the author.
The stories of Thor may show that the power of the gross cannot equal the cleverness of the wise, while the legends of Arthur reveal the importance of dreaming.
A large part of the myths would be too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene for school instruction, said Crossley-Holland, who advocates for careful selection of age-appropriate works.
"I think it's great that myths and folk art are already part of education", he said.
I've been defending this plan for 20 years.
He added that openly educating authors and teachers are on the side of engaging stories with a subtle message for children as a catalyst.
Crossley-Holland, who translated the epic Beowulf from English and also writes the Penguin Book and the British National Anthem, says, "You can have good intentions, but you do better to keep them to yourself".
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need for some sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end up happy-go-lucky, but there has to be a natural sense of good and evil.
And it has to be subconscious; revealed through a story, not openly set.
The old truth is, it's better to show than to describe.
Brno Star Station will take visitors into space in a new digital format
At first glance, it's clear that the hall of the big planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There's a new stage, visitors can get into new comfortable seats, and a 17 meter dome-shaped projection area from the American company Spitz has been added above their heads.
In the middle of the hall is the most important part of it, the new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, there are other smaller projectors scattered throughout the room.
Another important part of the whole facility is hidden behind the hall walls.
"It's about twenty-one computers that generate images", said Brno's director of the astronomical observatory, Jiří Dušek.
The computer will ensure that the image is not overlaid by multiple projectors, but gives a holistic impression.
"Computers are 30 to 40 times more efficient than conventional personal computers", said astronomer Tomáš Hladík.
The digital can enchant an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body, or the ocean floor.
The audience will be right in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Another similar facility is nearest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
The star management plans to showcase the program they've purchased and their own work.
There's two shows on the schedule from Saturday.
The first one is called Astronaut and it's for adults.
People learn about astronaut training, fly into space, turn around on the centrifuge, and then see in striking examples how astronauts face the harsh conditions of space.
The second series is for kids and it's called Magic Reef - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a rock whose colorful inhabitants lived a quiet life until the moment a nearby volcano erupted.
The entire digital library cost about 50 million crowns, paid for mostly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the Starz factory also contributed smaller amounts from their budget.
The projection area was 10 million crowns, the projector 12 million.
"The rest of the audio-visual technology and computers were swallowed up", explained Dušek.
The digitization was followed by the reconstruction of the entire building that the observatory underwent two years ago.
According to Director Dušk, there could be 25,000 to 30,000 visitors by the end of the year.
We have studied 11 thousand INSERATES!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis found over 11,000 job advertisements, of which 4,300 were published in the daily press and 6,800 were online (62 percent).
The Internet is thus becoming the most important means of publishing job offers.
In 2005, when the survey was first conducted, it was 26 percent.
In the last two surveys (2007, 2010), it was around 60%.
The advertisements for job opportunities in themselves, according to the analysis, reflect to a considerable extent the current situation on the labour market.
A simple example is a comparison of the number of advertisements published in times of economic prosperity and economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, almost 25 900 advertisements were published in the same period, compared to less than half in 2012.
The online job offer is geared towards a narrower, more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the job offer in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including those of workers, said study author Pavlina Szťastnová.
The representation of the selected professional groups varies between the two media.
The Internet has been dominated by advertisements seeking managers and executives, business representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The positions of programmers or small business executives were only available on the Internet.
The proportion of these professions in the daily press is significantly lower, while the main occupations are the service and labour professions.
Of course, education is among the most frequently cited requirements that employers express through an offer of employment.
Other areas monitored included knowledge of foreign languages, in particular English.
In the daily press, the requirement for foreign language knowledge was stated in three percent of advertisements, and on the Internet in 37 percent.
Only two percent of the advertisements required active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Complaints about 'computer literacy' were found in 40 percent of advertisements (11 percent in daily print, 57 percent online).
Practice in the industry was required in 54 percent of advertisements.
Practice requirements are always linked to qualified professions.
In particular, they are the production managers and other managers.
The main occupations of workers are mechanics and repairers, or manufacturers and processors of food products, or repairers of electrical appliances, added study author Jiří Tillner.
Employers also indicate in half of their advertisements the requirements for the qualities and skills of potential candidates.
Communication skills have long been the most demanded skills in advertising.
Furthermore, employers require flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, independence, responsibility, organisational capacity and reliability.
Ben Greenman: The 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be argued that New York City was the birthplace of the American comedy scene: nearly a century ago, the variety artist Frank Fray, who served as the ceremonial chairman at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling the crowd jokes using a method of conversation.
Fay's innovation has spread over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and directed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines Institute of Solo Comedy, the festival is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year with more than sixty performances in small clubs and big theaters.
"Most of these titles have appeared in the Carolinas and have become so successful that they're too big to play in a club", Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wandy Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as Stand Up for Heroes, an annual musical comedy benefit show at Madison Square Garden, which features Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby among others.
As the festival expanded, so did the world of comedy.
Several comedians attending this year's festival came from non-traditional channels, such as shows on smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has made his sitcom (happy picnic on FXX's fantastic-football theme) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both the Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation programs, but is best known for her fast-moving series Marcel the shell with shoes on.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with distinctly recognizable voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, sober, racially oriented W. Kamau Bell), are the product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest highlights of the festival will be an interview with David Steinberg speaking to Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a TV Land show called Sit down comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting is at Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedic DNA of Larry's work", Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks down the alley between two buildings and thinks, "Man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here".
Oil prices dropped further to $ 96 a barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns over high stocks were balanced by a report showing a strengthening of China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector.
The US oil supply index for December dropped 14 cents in European e-commerce on the New York Stock Exchange in the late morning to $96.24 a barrel.
Thursday, it was down 39 cents and for the month of October, it was down 5.8 percent.
The rich oil reserves in recent weeks have weighed on the price.
The Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. stocks have increased by 4.1 million barrels in the past week.
In five weeks, the stockpile has increased by more than 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday, two reports on Chinese production led to higher demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rose to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after the previous two decades of weakness.
Brent oil, an indicator of international oil used by U.S. refineries, dropped 26 cents on the London International Trade Exchange to $108.58 a barrel.
Not like that, Mr. Hash.
We have a unique way of telling politicians that this is not the way to do it.
There must be pressure to remove Martin Hashek from all political positions and leave his parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution would reduce the level of political culture that is already so fading.
Martin Hashek is proud of the promise he made, but everyone and politicians in particular must be aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very carefully what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital a politician has (Mr Babiš has the material, but the question is whether he is a politician).
The best program promoted by a liar is unreliable.
In politics, you don't apologize, in politics you back off.
Mr. Hash, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me, unless you're lying - here you see how complicated lying is), you'll leave politics alone, like a man.
Then people will accept your apology as an expression of a man who made a mistake and is responsible for it.
Otherwise, you will be seen as a backless weakness whose words and actions cannot be trusted.
You want to be a proud, if not a mistaken person, or a lifelong sketch artist.
It may seem unfair to you to address only you, but you are the leader and they are just the wrong sheep.
And you're a leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand you're trying to turn your ears in for a moment, rally your forces, sit down and attack again, but that's what partisans and instigators do.
You are, I repeat, in your eyes, the leader, the alpha male, so act like one.
Take responsibility and get out of politics.
The court blocked the order on the arrest and search procedure by the NYPD
The Federal Court of Appeals on Thursday blocked a court order requiring changes to the arrest and search program at the New York Police Department and dismissed the judge in the case.
The Second U.S. Court of Appeals said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision will be postponed until the city's appeal decision.
In August, the judge ruled that the city violated the Constitution by implementing its program of arresting and interrogating people.
The city of its findings and its amending regulations were challenged, including a decision to assign oversight to help the police department change its procedures and its training program.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the requested suspension on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal held that the judge must be dismissed because she had come into conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, by failing to comply as a judge with the requirement to avoid appearing to be taken, partly because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she openly responded to criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unfairly targeting blacks and Hispanics as part of their arrest and search programs.
It has established an independent monitoring body to monitor major changes including process reform, training and supervision and has launched a pilot programme to test body cameras in some of the most frequent stops.
In August, New York City approved the end of the method of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were denied after a police search.
The City is scheduled to give oral justification for the appeal sometime after 14 March 2014.
The arrest and search tactics have been criticized by many civil rights activists.
There have been some form of stopping and searching for people for decades, but the number of searches recorded under independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg has grown dramatically to a record 684,330 in 2011, mostly black and Hispanic.
In 2004, four men, all of whom are minorities, filed a lawsuit that became a class action lawsuit.
Supporters of the changes to the NYPD's stop and search program say the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force, and may affect how other police departments use these practices.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale, but not crime, and that they will waste money, but they will not solve the broader problem of the police force being under pressure after its numbers have declined by several thousand people over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the constitutional practice of stopping and searching people, but reformed the way the NYPD conducted searches.
One fifth of shopping malls are experiencing low traffic
This is according to data from the real estate consultancies Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
The Krakow shopping centre is open to the public in Bohnice, Prague, and will be the 19th shopping centre in Prague.
There are now a total of 90 major shopping centres in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance is about 20 percent of medium and large centers.
The main problems are inadequately large centre to the location and poor layouts, so too many floors or complicated and inconspicuous layout of passages, or dead centre places", said Michal Soták of Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to Jones Lang LaSalle's head of retail real estate, Sylvie Samadi, about a fifth of malls are experiencing low visitor numbers.
The main reasons include poor transport availability, low income categories of local residents or market overcrowding in the place.
Some projects opened almost fully, but their results were mostly unsatisfactory at first.
Today's customers are somewhat conservative and don't like to change their shopping habits.
The new shopping centres must be more committed to attracting customers to new brands in the market, entertainment, services and marketing", added Samadi.
The number of shopping centres is generally stable, according to Soták, and even rises at some centres because the tenants were willing to discount rent and subsidise some units in the crisis.
"But it is true that some projects have recently opened that are not fully occupied and thus reduce average occupancy (e.g. Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Shantovka in Olomouc)", added Soták.
The shopping centres opened in the last two years are progressing very slowly in the market, according to Sylvia Samadi.
But there's a market for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see a space for a project to serve the people of Prague 6.
There is certainly room in the market for the construction of smaller local projects, called 'convinience centres', focused on shopping and services for the people living in the immediate vicinity", Samadi said.
According to Soták, there is also room for more shopping malls on the local market.
This is true for small 'service' centres, for large projects in Prague, or for medium-sized projects, or for expansion in regional cities.
"Cities like Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth", added Soták.
In Prague, he sees space for a ready-made shopping centre on Victory Square, and he also believes that there is a clear potential for the streets of Příkopá and Václavské náměstí.
"The expansion of retail parks is intensively developing, which allow merchants to cover and expand to smaller cities at favourable rental and operating costs, and there is also space for smaller local or residential shopping centres in some locations, or their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of Prior's shopping houses, which benefit from a good location", added Dita Kubánková of DTZ.
The Czech Republic currently has 90 modern shopping centres with a total gross leasable area of more than 2,2 million square metres.
A quarter of all these shopping centres are located in Prague.
Incoma GfK has data showing that the 20 largest shopping centres by number of tenants, nine of which are in Prague, are located in the city.
The Czech Republic is below the EU average in terms of shopping malls, compared to the UK and France, which are about 50 square metres behind the Czech Republic per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson hacked into the phone to check the tip.
Former News of the world (NotW) editor Andy Coulson allegedly used phone hacking, surveillance and confrontational techniques to confirm a fraudulent love affair tip that was supposed to have involved then-Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis at the Old Bailey said that the News of the World had picked up a false report in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his attractive special counsel Hannah Pawlby.
The newspapers ordered private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voice mail and infiltrate her privacy, but the court found that Coulson had also called her and left her voice messages.
"The DA suggests that Mr. Coulson, now NotW's editor, is not a man who stands outside hoping to catch people outdoors, but a man who likes to tell people stories to see what they have to say", Mr. Edis said.
He said the NotW used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
He obviously knows about the other one, the surveillance, he must know about her.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says no, we say, "But sure he knows".
Rumors of the love affair Clarke is involved in were first captured by the NotW newsroom when a source who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby was told, "You're wasting your time, it's with Charles".
A recording of voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records in the private investigator's computer where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were labeled "Projects".
During the time Mrs. Pawlby was being investigated, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls asking for information about the Pawlbys, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief newsman Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup were overseeing the tracking of Mrs. Pawlby's movements.
Coulson left her a voice message on June 18, 2005, saying, "I got a story we're going to publish tomorrow, and I'd love to talk to Charles about it".
Mr. Edis says Coulson's involvement in the story was modeled after that of other prominent figures, including former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The court on Thursday found that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett over a love affair with a married woman while he himself was seeing his co-accused Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied any involvement with other individuals in a phone hacking operation between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have confessed to hacking into the phone.
The NSA's revelation increases public paranoia of state surveillance.
On a quiet day in late August, a German police helicopter was blowing up the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, the German economic capital.
At the request of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to photograph the roof of the US forward guard, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media claim that the BfV hoped to be able to identify the presence of wiretaps and this event triggered an exchange of views between the US and German Foreign Ministers in Berlin.
James Clapper, the US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again in September that the United States was not using its foreign intelligence capabilities to steal foreign companies' trade secrets to the benefit of American companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits.
But since Edward Snowden, who became a whistleblower, began to expose his valuable collection of secret surveillance by the United States, European governments and leading businessmen no longer know whether to believe the director's words.
After reports that the US National Security Agency had spied on Brazilian oil companies and gained access to data held by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, there was widespread paranoia about the new dimensions of government surveillance.
The latest strain came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone may have been tapped for 10 years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then there is no doubt that leading entrepreneurs are potential targets.
Snowden has made it clear that there is an intense cooperation between the U.S. intelligence community and the corporate world.
I would say it's possible that these data are being used to mutual benefit.
'Germany must wake up,' said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey published in July by the EY consultancy, German companies are convinced that the US now poses as much risk as China in terms of industrial espionage and data theft.
But in all the documentation Mr. Snowden has uncovered so far, there is no evidence that the United States has passed on foreign trade secrets to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and said it should try to limit its dependence on the US:
The leading businessmen are skeptical of this.
There are voices in the German parliament that we should build a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and open them slowly again...
That's not the way to go, says Hasso Plattner, president of German software company SAP.
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn't have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is donated, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
The scale and technical sophistication of the US spy agencies exposed by Snowden is shocking to some companies who have previously thought China to be the biggest threat from surveillance.
There is a major shift in cloud computing where European officials have become more aware that data stored in the US is under their jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of non-U.S. members have dropped plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after the disclosure of the U.S. Prism data mining program.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP's CEOs, says, "We have a new question for customers that wasn't here a year ago - where are my data stored, and can you guarantee that they will physically stay in that jurisdiction?"
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are only confirmation of what they already know: that the powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that these data must be protected at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is not surprising.
It's always happened.
"It has been a key issue for many years and has not changed significantly during the current discussion", says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF Agrochemicals.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial levels, just as we are spying on them, because it is in our national interest to protect our businesses.
Business leaders generally do not want to brag about the countermeasures they have taken to prevent the attacker from gaining an advantage.
For large companies, it's been long remembered that taking a free USB drive to a trade fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unwise.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi board, says that it has been common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as a listening device.
The German BfV advises senior executives to consider not using simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign trips because of the risk of smartphone fraud.
The prepaid cell phones are then thrown away.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are leading global market players in their specific areas.
Small and mediumsized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorised access, warns the BfV in its report.
The United States warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, US National Intelligence Estimate documents listed France in February, along with Russia and Israel, as the second-largest number of perpetrators involved in economic intelligence hacking, behind China.
A board member of the German risk-free society has concluded that the French are the worst when it comes to economic espionage.
Bernard Squarcini, former head of France's DCRI, said in an interview this month: "The authorities know very well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.
Parents of a Georgia minor who died in a freak accident believe he was murdered
The parents of a Georgia teenage boy whose body was found inside a wrestling ghost in his high school gym believe their son was murdered, family attorney said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found lying in a flatbed spirit on January 11th behind the stands of the gym he attended.
The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office has concluded that Johnson died of an accident, but the family of the 17-year-old boy denies it.
"They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered", lawyer Benjamin Crump, who represents Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said.
"They believe it's against logic, the laws of physics and common sense", Crump said.
They believe it's to cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school and he came back in a body bag", he said.
Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he was conducting a regular investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe there is a sufficient basis for a regular investigation", he said.
Moore told reporters that the original autopsy indicated Johnson died of suffocation.
But Moore said the second autopsy gave a different cause of death.
There are a few questions that must be answered or confirmed, he said.
Moore added that if he reveals enough evidence in Johnson's death to warrant an investigation into a crime or civil rights violation, he will ask the FBI to carry it out.
A deputy from the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not immediately available for comment Thursday.
A judge in southern Georgia on Wednesday ordered the authorities to make available all surveillance video footage that investigators have examined.
The teenager's parents hope the videos will contain clues to how their son died.
The CDC has issued a school directive on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help children with food allergies in school.
This is the first set of such guidelines issued by the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools on how to raise awareness of childhood food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
It is also recommended that schools have adrenaline  available, the most common use being an EpiPen  automatic injector to help them respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State legislatures recently updated rules that make it easier for schools to store adrenaline.
The report also lists the typical symptoms of conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child may say, "It's like someone's banging my tongue, I feel like I have hair on my tongue, or they're making me feel my tongue".
Parents of intersex children may choose the opposite sex
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise the third sex in children born with vague gender identity.
Newborn babies will no longer be classified as either male or female.
The new law does not require parents to specify any gender for such children and allows them to list the gender as 'neuter' or 'unspecified' on their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law is to stop pressuring parents to rush to their child's sex-determination surgery and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person, according to the BBC, said after many years, "I'm neither a man nor a woman".
I'll remain a salt-shaped doctor, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that every year, one in 2,000 babies is born who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 factors that fall into the diagnosis of sexual developmental disorders, a shorthand term for those with atypical chromosomes, genital glands (ovariates or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
The intersex could have been Wallis Simpson.
Gender determination is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information and determine it rather than waiting and monitoring the child's psychological and physical development until surgery is performed, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-determination issues, said the new German law "seems like a good thing".
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children are not", he said.
Gender determination can be done without surgery and then you can wait for the identity to develop.
The knowledge of how a child's sexuality develops is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
A report to the European Committee in 2011 described intersex persons as different from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not based on gender but on their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either.
These traits may be expressed in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle size, hair growth, breasts and figure, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transsexual people in the workplace, as well as levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Guys who don't fit any gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal allow adults to identify in official documents as male, female or third gender.
Norrie May-Welby, 52, an Australian, became the world's first recognized sexless person in June when she won a court appeal to keep her status as a sexless person for the rest of her life.
According to the Interior Ministry, German passports will have a third designation, X, for intersex persons, in addition to the M (male) and F (female).
In neighboring France, according to a news report on France 24, the issue of gender remains controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this heavily Catholic country signed a petition to remove sex theories from school textbooks.
The American Catholic online website also commented on the German law, writing: As the world is drawn to a new state where gender is a matter of choice but sexual activity is not, we are turning two more pillars of civilization upside down.
A newborn mother in Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would rather see her babies assigned sex at birth.
Parenting alone is stressful and without further restrictions, especially if you don't know your child's sex, she told parenting websites.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, both male and female babies were called hermaphroditic, after the handsome Greek who was bisexual.
And about ten years ago, the medical community thought that sex was like a board that could be erased and redrawn.
But now many are questioning the ethical basis of surgery, saying that sexuality is a complex issue, and that doctors can sometimes make the wrong decisions because they don't know how their children will feel about their sex when they grow up.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called psychiatric emergency", Drescher said.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The prevailing theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sex was put forward by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who held that sex is subjective.
He coined the new concept of "sexual belonging" and argued that social causes and environmental influences "how parents raised their child" "acted on the child's genes and hormones and formed the child regardless of whether he was identified as male or female".
But in one case in 1966, known as John/Joan, his theory became controversial.
To the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged by a bad circumcision, he recommended that his child be completely castrated, his testicles removed, and raised as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different", Drescher said.
When the boy was 15, he had surgery to re-invent himself into a boy and married a woman.
At the age of 38, however, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors still use this model today.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these operations showed dissatisfaction with the results.
This was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male chromosomes but a vague sex drive.
Doctors were unsure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man he could never live a satisfying life.
And so, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce had his external organs and testicles surgically removed and was raised as a girl.
He got female hormones at 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl", he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
At 18, he was sent to a vaginal surgery.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was scary.
I was sterilized after birth and nobody ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a sexual developmental disorder (DSD) that prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop its sexual system.
After he learned the truth, he turned back into a man, took testosterone doses and had his breasts removed,
The surgery caused his infertility.
Today, she represents others in an organization called the Interface Project, and she's trying to normalize the perception of intersex people.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the California-based legal group Advocates for informed choice, worries that German law is "provoking stigma and stigma".
"Many activists fear that the German law will achieve the goal of encouraging parents to make quick decisions and choose the right choice for their child", she said.
We're afraid it might call for intervention.
We think it's better to assign a male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will eventually go, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organisation supports Australian law because it allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex.
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legally valid sex", she said.
German law is going to assign him at birth.
It's a battle a little child shouldn't be fighting right now.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based chest radiologist who has a daughter with a developmental disability and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that German law would grant powers to both parents and children.
Baratz' daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has DSD called androgen-insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are defective, Katie has developed female traits.
She has a vagina, but she doesn't have a uterus and ovaries.
Now 29, Katie is married and works as a pediatric psychiatric intern at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
"The law gives parents a certain space to not rush their decision", Baratz said.
It gives them time to do some tests and think it over and it gives them time to write a male or female.
In that respect, everything is fine. You raise your child and you love him.
You have a wonderful baby and you're happy about it.
You don't have to rush an operation that's irreversible.
"It gives the child the opportunity to participate in decision-making and takes away the anxiety that parents feel about not being sure they're doing the right thing", she said.
Eventually the child decides which gender he identifies with more, and that's a great thing.
It empowers children to make their own decisions.
A drunkard has filled the house with gasoline, threatening to burn it and his family!
The tension was rising, the fear was escalating.
The man threatened to burn the whole house down.
All available police patrols in the area, as well as the Young Boleslav Fire Brigade and the Volunteer Fire Brigade, were deployed.
A police negotiator arrived, trying to justify the man's irrational behavior.
The man continued to threaten to set the house on fire.
So the house must have been broken into by an intercept unit that disabled the man and locked him up.
The aggressor was then examined at the Juvenile Hospital, from where he was taken to the alcohol detention station.
The firefighters eventually filled the house with gasoline and later cleaned it up.
In addition to the people, all the pets were rescued from the house.
The man didn't give a police negotiator a chance, so a team went after him.
Report: Obama's campaign was considering replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest adviser, according to the New York Times, was secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden as the 2012 nominee for Hillary Clinton.
This revelation is the most significant sensation of the highly anticipated 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann Double down: Game Change 2012.
The Times received a copy of the forthcoming book and announced Thursday evening that senior aides to the president were holding an intensive group meeting and polling in late 2011 to assess whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama's faded hopes of re-election.
According to National Policy Correspondent Jonathan Martin of the Times, the book offers a detailed record of the efforts of senior officials within the campaign and in the White House, namely former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, to measure the election impact of moving former Secretary of State Clinton to the post of vice president.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only a few of the president's closest advisers, including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House chief counsel David Axelrod and David Plouffe, knew that the change was being considered.
The book Double Down claims that Daley was the representative of an effort to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make the move, when data showed that adding Clinton to the nomination would not significantly increase Obama's chances.
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden Clinton.
I've been doing a lot of research, and this was one of them, he told The Daley.
You must remember that the president had a terrible outlook at the time, so we thought, "Christ, what are we going to do?"
While Daley described the research as "important care", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to see if the election move paid off.
"We don't spend that kind of money on election and qualitative research when we don't really think about it", Martin told AC360.
It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was considering the exchange.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his then-boss knew about this potential card mixing.
While Daley said he didn't think the president was aware of the potential changes, the former chief of staff admitted that it was possible that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double Down" definitely doesn't answer the question of whether the political probe got to the Obama desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the investigation into Biden's candidacy.
"Maybe", Martin said.
A fantastic ice cream that lights up in the dark?
A British businessman made the first ice cream that glows in the dark using a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminous spark.
He came up with the idea when he read a paper on jellyfish, and he convinced scientists in China to chemically make a protein that causes lightning.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer's tongue  to increase the pH of the protein and subsequently cause its radiation.
Chris says that ice cream glows when it reacts to the heat of your mouth, and so the more you lick, the brighter it glows.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company Lick me I'm delicious says: It's a wonderful substance, but when it comes to production, we're just getting started, so for £200 you get about 2g of this substance.
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level rises and the ice cream starts to shine.
We've been testing it for the last few months and it seems like a great idea for Halloween, because it creates this fantastic glow effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the lighting of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
And so each hill is worth me about £140.
But it tastes great.
Charlie's Bristol-based experimental company is known for its unconventional flavours of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next product is going to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I really wish I could make an invisible ice cream".
It's essentially impossible because of the lack of light caused by the ice crystal that makes ice, but I'm counting on us finding some way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish artificially made by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: According to Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat sweets, stay up for long hours, and show off to our neighbors in disguise.
I feel like I've become a warden today.
Two years since there was no diabetes in my apartment, and this year it's probably not going to be any different.
But the statistics show that when it comes to Halloween, I'm a black sheep.
According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), this year most Americans will celebrate Halloween  in fact 158 million of them  and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes, and jewelry.
But what I look forward to every Halloween is trending.
According to NRF, $6.9 billion of the lost is expected to go toward $1.2 billion in costumes.
This year, the latest fashion shot is sexy inanimate objects.
Sexy doesn't just have to be women anymore; sexy can be foods like pizza, hamburger and carrots.
As for the men, I expect a lot of zombies to come through the parade, and I bet the space men from Daft Punk will be able to get it on our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombie, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with going by tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes, and to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans are spending $330 million this year on pet costumes.
So he's gonna see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don't waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans are spending $1.9 billion.
That's about 300 million pounds of Hershey, candy, Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark's rod.
That's amazing news for the 41 million callers who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to storm our neighborhood.
In fact, on Halloween, we buy, and believe it or not, we consume, 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Association of Sugar Dealers, it's going to sell nearly 16,000 tons around Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candies.
That's a secret I've never solved.
There's nothing more typical of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, like "Terror behind the walls", "Howl-O-Scream" and "The house of shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially dedicated haunted houses in the United States that the American Haunted Houses Company says have a profit of $500 million, and that includes those amazing photos of you being spooked by fear that your friend posts on Facebook, and you can't remove them, and the person you like looks at the photo and comments like, "You're looking at your face".
And finally, a little bit about the pumpkins.
When we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin, and cutting a pumpkin lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree.
Fortunately for us, the "baby in the pumpkin" trend started with Pinterest last year, so most of us grew up carving the stick instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans spend about $106 million on pigeons.
The daylight with the flaming flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkin grew this year.
If you're looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California and try cutting their pumpkins weighing almost a ton.
Announcement of the Land Rover racing series
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts as well as intercommunication equipment.
The selection includes improved brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between plants.
Drew Bowler, technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The race participants who come to Bowler have changed.
Not all of them are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also an accessible path to world-class racing.
We are delighted to be able to offer them this ride in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe this format offers a new way to experience different racing disciplines in the UK and overseas, and that it will prepare competitors for the harshness and reality of Rally Raid racing.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge car. It's gonna be a really exciting race.
The Defender Challenge will also offer a training and testing day in February and the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
We have an early election in two years.
TOP 09 chairman Karel Schwarzenberg is expecting another early election soon.
A week after the last one in an interview with Aktuálně.cz he said there was no other way out and every government came out of the vote last Friday and Saturday is impossible blind.
"It can't last long", said Karel Schwarzenberg, estimating the life span of the election to be two years.
He disagrees, saying that voters will barely make a completely different choice next time, saying, "I think it's going to be a little more balanced decision".
At the same time, the TOP 09 chairman does not admit that his party could lose voters in the next elections like this year (compared to 2010, it lost about 300 thousand votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it were clear within two months that there would be an early election, it would strengthen Andrey Babiš's ANO 2011 movement.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Grandma will lose.
The turbulent situation in the CSSD, where Chairman Bohuslav Sobotka after a secret meeting of the party leadership part declared that he or Michal Hašek would remain in the leadership of Social Democracy, Schwarzenberg comments in his own way:
"The leaders of the Democratic Party, as little boys, go to the head of state to allow them to take over the party".
"I thought Mr. Hashek was smarter and smarter".
"Because I've never seen anything so eagerly done in my life", added the TOP 09 chairman.
And to President Zeman (whom he met in the presidential race) he said, "The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to take over the party".
The first laws have already been submitted by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally presented its first draft laws to the House, including the Farmer's Register of Treaties, which was discussed by the House committees before the elections, but fell to the table with the early elections.
TOP 09 chairman in an interview with Aktuálně.cz claims that such speed is given by "these laws are needed".
But at the same time, TOP 09 clearly wants to overtake similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the ANO electoral leader Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the election campaign of "stealing" the ANO programme with the idea of establishing a contract register.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the lead - it has simply blown out a proposal that had already been passed by the House in its second reading.
Firefighters have come to rescue a lost puppy who was trapped 15 meters above ground on a dangerous rock slope
Ruby's cock-spinned runner got away in a little car accident.
Three days later, he was seen trapped in a stone quarry by a man who had strung the dog.
Firefighters have been salting through a rock wall to save a dog from certain death.
The puppy was rescued by firefighters who came to rescue him after somehow trapping himself in a dangerous quarry in a rocky outcrop 15 meters above the ground.
Nine-month-old cock-spaniel Ruby escaped a minor car accident on a Sunday afternoon, surviving alone for three days until he was released from the quarry on Wednesday.
Its owner Scott Alderson (25) and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were at the Flappit quarry in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to meet Ruby again and to thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After he escaped, when he got into a small accident, they were feverishly searching for his lost dog and posting calls on social media.
On Wednesday at about 2:15 p.m., a sharp-eyed infantryman spotted Ruby stuck on a cliff in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and sent down to free Ruby, using an animal transport bag to pick him up from the rock.
Technical rescue team commander Andy Clayton said the dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of a rock wall, 15 meters from the top and bottom.
He didn't move his eyebrows when he was rescued. He was totally frozen.
But he's fine now.
Then he got cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
It's incredible that someone saw the dog.
Technical rescue team commander Peter Lau said: "Ruby was very lucky during his escape.
There was a possibility that he might have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a physical, and apart from exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Miss Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire said, "I was scared to see the rescue.
I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to hold him again.
The vet said if he got too tired and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
The fire department did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're so grateful to them, they were all just great.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there".
The firefighters were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger claims that after Katy Perry was 18 years old, she definitely didn't leave.
During an interview with an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said that she sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he went after her.
And she added, "It was a long time ago, and now he's very kind to me.
In a statement Thursday, Jagger's representative (70) said he categorically denies ever making proposals to Katy Perry.
The deputy said, "Maybe she's confusing him with someone else".
Perry was one of the guest vocalists who appeared on the Rolling Stones' concert string this year.
Her new album Prism debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another scary story about independence.
This time, there is a warning that the condition for independent Scotland's EU membership would be its accession to the Schengen area.
That set off the story of the Berwick passport controls and the wire that was woven along Hadrian's Wall.
True, the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but  as might have been expected  it didn't make headlines.
Nor did anyone mention that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if they like.
Since Scotland is not in the Schengen area now, an offer of continued disagreement would be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for whatever they really want from the Scots.
So it's a rather weak story.
And it's so old that it's become a dig, the newspaper duck that "independence means passport control", I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet, there is an interesting idea in this bearded narrator.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe?
Why trade the London chomout for the Brussels one, especially now?
This is the true story of Europe: the great postwar plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
The impact of the euro crisis has left the so-called Europe Project officially dead.
Across Europe, parties devoted to resistance to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency are gaining influence.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany, founded this year, has come out of nowhere, having already won almost five million votes in the September federal election, essentially taking the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
On the home soil there has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, has become a defining moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, coupled with the strain on national economies by adhering to the common currency, have led many to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments managing a high budget deficit  this was only true in Greece.
Rather, it is a euro system that blocks its members from exchange rates that are favourable to German exporters  and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluing the domestic currency, Southern Europe has a disadvantage over Germany in terms of domestic production.
The only way to do this is to cut revenues and public spending, which Germany urges.
The current budgetary and monetary problems are the root cause of Europe's low performance.
As a result of the green energy policy supported by Brussels, the French and German corporate consumer aid code costs European industry twice as much for electricity and four times more for gasoline than in the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Not even a single freeze in the world's wages would have reversed the European petrochemical industry's downfall from cheap US shale oil.
The result is a smoldering rebellion, especially in France, once an enthusiastic EU supporter.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool to keep Germany in check and allow Paris to rise to the level of Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as proof of political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe and left the worn French economy to its fate.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right wing, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial by-election and pushed the ruling Socialists to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote  an early warning to British Labour that they cannot predict that the split of the right will automatically manifest itself positively on the left.
How is Le Pen coping with her newfound popularity among the white working class?
The European elections next year would like to use it to create an anti-European bloc against the common currency across the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time in its history.
I think that in the near future, growing anti-European sentiment and attitude towards the common currency will unite and the euro will weaken.
The EU will not disappear, but will be transformed into something more free in the sense of a Europe of (sovereign) nations, which General de Gaulle had already preferred.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project and stick to the United States.
But Washington's increased interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area of (basically) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests. That includes announcing to Berlin and Brussels when to let us go.
I suppose Scotland would do well in a loose order of Europe, provided it kept its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should take the example of Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is  unsurprisingly  the most successful non-austerity political movement in Europe, having won a large majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition stance against the cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and subsequent coalitions of conservatives and liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland voted for independence just to adopt the austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Early adult
Research has shown that African-American and Hispanic women reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching
There is no evidence of hormones or other chemicals
Experts say that an epidemic of obesity may be a trigger for early puberty.
The trend of earlier puberty is not so obvious in boys.
Former CNN reporter Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be scared when her daughter starts growing breasts and shaving in disgrace at seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are fairly common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I spent a lot of time assuring my parents that it's not usually a sign of rapid development toward full puberty", Kaplowitz said.
Signs of development, such as breast growth, hair on the forearm and forearm, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But over the past 40 years, there has been little change in the age at which the first menstrual period occurs.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years, compared with 12.75 years in 1970.
When breasts start developing, it takes at least two to three years before the first menstrual period occurs, said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
There is debate about what actually activates the onset of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by growth spurt before age 8, a girl is considered to be "premature"
In most cases, the process slows or stops  which can be closely monitored by paediatricians.
Rapid growth may be a reason for an endocrinologist to perform tests to rule out serious problems such as a tumor or cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature bone ageing, which can eventually lead to growth and decay in adulthood.
Recommendations for medicines and hormone therapy depend on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
When it comes to drug deployment, Kaplowitz is cautious, but he acknowledges that suppressing puberty can alleviate a girl's behavioral problems and her feelings of being different from her peers.
Another big problem, understandably, is that parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They're worried she might get pregnant or how she'll handle hygiene", Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock", recalls one woman whose daughter started menstruating at age 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation together, she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
But there is no consistent body of evidence yet that the hormones in milk or other foods, the chemicals in the environment, or the sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz proposes that the most serious cause is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped run a study on girls aged 6 to 9 that linked body fat to the timing of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-Americans and Hispanics tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
There are different explanations.
Globally, early puberty patterns seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another myth: Although boys may experience facial hair and disgrace at an early age, the trend toward full-bloom early puberty is not as clear as it is for girls.
Other doctors attending the American Association of Pediatricians (AAP) conference have added to the complexity of this topic.
Acne and baldness are common even in infants and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty", said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for instructions on how to talk to their children.
"It may mean having to talk to your child sooner than you think", advised Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, your child will likely respond well.
Early-growing girls need reassurance that even if they are premature, this process is a normal part of life.
I'm going to play Convalink as a waitress.
Has he got a new job?
Actress Nadya Konvalinkova (62) appeared behind bars as a waitress and she was doing very well.
That the popular Czech actress was planning to change careers and start a bar business?
The Convaline came to the James Joyce Irish pub and turned on the beer.
I was doing it for the first time in my life, and I was doing it right away.
Even my boss offered to hire me and make me a living by spinning beer.
But I refused, I preferred to stay in what I am doing today, acting", said Konvalink, who was a guest at the 20th anniversary of the Irish pub.
"I like Irish beer and I'll have Irish whiskey here too", the actress expressed her taste.
Nadia's old friend and colleague Pavel Novi also appeared at the event.
I'm dead and I can't drink in this new life.
I'm allowed one beer or one drink a day, and I try to keep it", the actor added.
Aircraft manufacturers are pushing for seat width, big contracts at stake
A dispute over the width of second-class seats on long-haul flights broke out among leading aircraft manufacturers, prompting a bitter exchange of views at the Dubai Air Show this month.
The width of seats provided for long-haul flights for the  economy class is not the width that airlines would normally have before them, but the width of the seats is the key to the efficiency claims for the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus has called for industry standards this week that would offer at least 46 centimetres wide economy-class seats, but major US rival Boeing says airlines should decide.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing for the largest version of their twin-engine long-range aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way the rear of the aircraft is arranged  especially whether it has 9 or 10 seats  next to each other is the basis for the economic performance requirements for the designs of new mini-jumbo aircraft.
Boeing says the upgraded 777X will carry 406 people in economy seats over 43 cm wide arranged in 10 rows.
Airbus says that a competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 46-cm wide economic seats spread out over nine.
The giant planes often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in the professional media.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai air show, where the 777X is expected to take the lead with more than 100 orders.
He recently pre-showcased what could be the start of a new advertising war when he showed the financiers a video of three people crammed into a restaurant entitled "Would you like it?"
"Boeing is promoting long-haul flights in narrower seats than regional turboprops", said John Leahy, Airbus' sales manager.
As dietary patterns change, people are bigger, but plane seats haven't changed radically.
Since the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul air travel, by the turn of the century, the average American, aged 40 to 49, had gained 10 percent in weight, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
According to U.S. medical statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a belt of 100 centimeters.
Airbus claims that its rival is following the 1950s seat concept, when the average width of seats on the newly-designed aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims to have conducted research that suggests that an extension of the seat by 2.5 centimeters will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing rejects Airbus' seat sizes and says it is not up to aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines balance fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more than just the width of the seat.
"It's really about giving airlines flexibility and enabling them to do the things they believe they need to do to be successful", said cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us dictating what's good for them.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, more elbow space is essential, but for suppliers, it's a growing problem that can affect revenue.
Behind this dispute is a competition in aircraft orders with an estimated turnover of at least $700 billion in catalogue prices over the next decades, enough to deflect the balance of U.S. and European exports.
As Reuters reported in July, the seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim that they achieve 20 percent better efficiency in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats.
Boeing's performance requirements depend in part on a comparison of the design of the 777X with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
The unit cost gain is weakened compared to the 10-seater concept.
"The reason Boeing is doing this is to increase the seating capacity and make its aircraft more competitive than our products", said Kevin Keniston, Airbus' European Passenger Comfort Manager.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in a row for existing 777 models are consistent with the fact that many passengers are for a denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower charges.
"The 45 centimetres wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an Airbus business perspective, the design is driven by the threat of the 777", said cabin interior designer Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but they offer airlines a catalog of suppliers to choose from.
Traveling airline vendors even carry a measuring band to check the competitive arrangement.
While boasting of comfort, all manufacturers also offer highly-density aircraft for low-cost airlines and regional travellers.
Airbus is offering a 10-seat A350 but says it hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the need for greater cabin adjustment by offering wider seats in the alleys for some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of one more major modern aircraft manufacturer, the challenge to new industry standards will remain unheard of, but may deter the 777X sales wave.
HIV infection in Prague has exceeded 1,000
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected people is increasing every year.
For example, in 2002, tests confirmed 50 people to have the infection, five years later, 121 were infected, and in 2010, 180 were infected.
Last year, 212 cases were reported, a record number.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases this year will exceed 200, I think there is no doubt about it anymore", said AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavaty, who for years led the Prague House of Light for Patients.
He said that from January to September last year, 165 HIV patients were reported in the country, up from 176 this year for the same period.
From the start of the follow-up to the end of September this year, tests confirmed HIV in 1,710 men and 353 women, with the highest number of infected in Prague.
Their number reached 1,05 in September.
In the Central Czech Republic, 206 infected persons were residing.
The diagnosis was also received by 156 people from South Moravia, 130 from Moravia and 116 from Ustiska.
The least infected are from the Highlands, 19 of them.
A total of 88 percent of patients were infected during sex.
Fourteen people have been infected in the past with blood transfusions.
However, such a case has not been detected in the Czech Republic since the beginning of the testing, i.e. more than a quarter of a century ago.
Six children were born with HIV, and it was passed on to them from their mother.
The nonsense in Gravity is, but the scene is beautiful, experts say.
A fantastic film from the universe of Gravity was released in the Czech cinema for some time after its premiere.
In October, it was seen by nearly 150,000 viewers and earned over 26 million crowns, according to the Union of Film Distributors.
Most reviews are positive.
But there are also certain irregularities.
Server Lidovky.cz asked experts from a number of astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jříšek (director of the Brno Star and Planetarium): I like science fiction movies, which I consider modern, dream fiction.
Gravity is not exclusive, even though it's a "physical reality" show.
No, but that doesn't mean he's bad.
I enjoyed it a lot.
You might notice Sandra Bullock's hair, which doesn't hang up in a weightless state.
Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station move in significantly different orbits, so they cannot be seen in one shot.
Some viewers of the film calculate the unrealistic effect and the whole behavior of the fire in the weightless state.
They don't think the suit could handle such a blow either.
The characters in Gravity often come into conflict with different objects, and the costumes can handle everything without much difficulty.
The criticism and the plot were spared.
Such a massive tragedy in Earth's orbit is unrealistic, some commentators say.
Plus, he wonders why the doctor was sent into space to fix the technique.
People in forums also argue about the "unreal" behavior of ropes.
She says it looks like it's meant for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (director of the Prague Observatory for Stars and Planets): I have only seen him on the big screen so far, but I can clearly say I was enchanted.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary, but a science fiction movie.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost the obligation) to disregard reality consistently.
"More than the irregularities you mentioned, I was touched by the three-fold depiction of space stations with degrading levels of technology (lastly Chinese)".
"Chinese will be around the end of the decade, and it'll probably look better than it does in a movie".
Vladimir Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, the authors try very successfully not to violate the laws of physics, and so the naturally oriented viewer will appreciate that in the various space collisions and collisions, the moment of momentum is quite correctly preserved, as the dictionary of physics says, also the view of the Earth from space is very realistic including the thin column of the atmosphere and the polar radiation flashing on the polar regions.
The discrepancies will be found in more detail.
In addition, for example, I found in the comments that the preferred direction of orbit of various cosmic debris appears in some scenes to be inverted from what it should actually be (west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences): Some things were adapted to their needs, but I did not see any fundamental and heaven-calling violations of logic or natural laws in the film, and compared to other films of similar focus, it is clear that the creators took into account the reliability of the events depicted.
From the point of view of the unintelligible, it's worth mentioning the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits in an otherwise inclined orbit than the ISS.
The result is a significantly different speed and the rescue operation could not actually proceed as shown in the film.
Then, at the moment of the separation of Clooney and Stone, I didn't notice the entire ISS was rotating, so there's no clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to let go when they stop moving towards each other.
A new nicotine vaccine may take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for life.
Before human tests, there are other tests that take years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York says the first signs are good.
"We strongly hope that this type of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit and exhaust all the methods available on the market today, but have found their addiction to nicotine to be so strong that it can overcome all current approaches", said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information to create anti-anticotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a smooth flow of these antibodies.
The antibodies chase all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker from getting nicotine.
In the vaccinated mice tested, which were supplied with nicotine, they continued their normal activities.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated were calmed down, the researchers said, which is a sign that nicotine had entered their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be given so often to maintain sufficient levels of antibodies, that they proved expensive and impractical.
The cost of a new vaccine should be much lower because it converts liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines were completely safe for humans, they could be given to children before they have a cigarette craving, thus avoiding nicotine addiction.
However, it is much more likely that smokers would use it to quit.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't benefit from the nicotine vaccine, and that will help them get rid of the habit", he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but they pointed out that further research is needed.
Tripodi denies that Obeid influenced him
The former Labor minister of New South Wales, Australia, will be investigated by the State Corruption Oversight Committee.
Former New South Wales Secretary of State Joe Tripodi denied he would change the coastal lease policy at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr Obeid lobbied several ministers to renew the lease on Circular Quay, where Mr Obeid owned two restaurants and a cafe, without having to participate in the tendering process after it expired in August 2005.
The committee is now investigating allegations that Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid's secret interests in these properties, based on evidence presented Thursday by former Deputy Chief of Staff to Mr Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of negotiations, which began in 2005, the government pressed for public tendering of leases.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer term terms.
In 2009, leases for businesses in Circular Quay, which brought the Obeid family $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to enter public competition.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of public procurement.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, insisted on a shift in government rent policy.
The call transcript submitted to ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr Obeid and Mr Tripod and Steve Dunne, the chief executive who came to the port resort after working under Mr Obeid in the fisheries department.
'Was the development of commercial rental policy the subject of the discussions during these phone calls?' asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr Tripodi.
"No", said Mr Tripodi.
I can't remember what we talked about, but definitely not this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli military aircraft hit a target in Syria, said the official responsible
Israeli military aircraft hit a target in the Syrian port of Laziqiya on Thursday night, the official in charge of the administration confirmed to Fox News.
This person responsible did not say specifically what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out airstrikes on missile shipments in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
Perhaps the Pechinki commentator spoke in a way that could be agreed upon, while President Happy was stirring up dissent.
Hejtman Chovanec was a suspect to me as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and he confirmed it.
The president of the Sabotka has always been, and still is, a symbol of the USSR's misery.
The other gentlemen have shown their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and readable and unusable, Vice President Zaorálek has been the most talked about on television.
I see no better option than for the CSSD to nominate the Senate vice-president, Gajdoshkov, as prime minister, the only one without the initial handicap, and I think she would perform the standard.
It's such a good solution, hardly anyone in the leadership will support it.
I'm adding that this solution is the only way to forget what happened and move on without tearing the party apart.
Alena Gajdoshkovya could easily form a minority government with the blessing of President Babiš and no people, but with the people's health minister Hovorkou, who is actually a believing Social Democrat.
This minority government would have great stability because it would enforce a proper referendum law and President Dawn Okamura has pledged to support it.
The Chairman of the Grandmother would eventually accept the tax advancement, because he's smart and he'll see that it can't be done without it.
The people would not bring trouble, because the Speaker is the bearer of the best they have, and they would not be in government otherwise.
The same goes for YES, there would be a valuable minister here, but if they reasonably don't want to enter into risky government involvement, but provide support, so well.
Let's give the courage to Elena Gajdoshko!
Foreign workers with visa authorisation may be tested for eligibility
As the government plans to expand police action, it is considering the 457 visa visa test.
The test, if accepted, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 programme from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a backdoor for moving family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion piece was published today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned government rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australian neighbors.
"The outspoken declarations of 'foreigners at the end of the front' and 'work first for Australians' are a very unpleasant remnant of the time when unions demanded a protected labour market", she told the Australian Indian Institute today.
Historically, this meant protecting the white labor force, and I wouldn't be surprised if anyone in this region recorded a ringing of this historic artifact.
The discussion article discusses 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday dealing with officials on human trafficking, has implemented five of the proposed changes and the rest remain to be considered.
If the eligibility criteria are accepted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether the nomination is eligible for situations where the candidate is in a relationship or personal connection with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking.
In the case of undertakings which have previously sponsored a small number of workers but have subsequently employed hundreds, the number of visa holders 457 may also be required to be justified.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on a shelter ship to Christmas Island this week.
The man's frightened nine-year-old son traveled to Australia with him, and after his father died on Wednesday, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the ship.
Australian authorities rushed the man to a hospital in Christmas Island, where he died.
The UK Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
HS2's work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and northern England will start as soon as the first phase is launched in 2026.
Baroness Kramer, Transport Secretary, said the project would bring Britain together.
Scottish Transport Secretary Keith Brown said he was delighted to be working with the UK government on this plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
After Phase Two is completed, the line will run from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the Government reassessed the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and the north of England from GBP 32,7 billion to GBP 42,6 billion.
The British Government, which has been in consultation with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 to identify additional railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for the north of England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our aim for HS2 is really a national network that will better connect the UK and its cities.
We gave SH2 green because the benefits it will bring are enormous.
Without it, we're facing a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
However, the linkage across the UK will also improve the connectivity of 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, thanks to HS2.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland.
For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to unambiguously support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: 'The high-speed railway has the potential to bring Scotland immense economic benefits, but it also supplies the economic weight of Scotland in the overall case of high-speed rail across the UK.
We are therefore eager to work with the UK Government to explore the possibilities of bringing high-speed rail to Scotland to everyone's benefit and to supplement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is planning anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report of this study with the British ministers over the next year and to jointly deciding on further steps.
She and Bart arrested an inspector and an analyst from the anti-corruption police.
The news of the arrest of Vít Bárta began to circulate on Thursday evening when the server Prvnízprava.cz brought the news.
MF DNES soon found out that the General Inspection of the Security Corps (GIBS) had taken over the case, and her men were to arrest Bart in central Prague.
It was outside the Four Seasons Hotel.
The Inspectorate shall deal with cases where police officers are among the accused, but its powers shall also apply to civilians.
According to MF DNES, one of the arrested is an anti-corruption police officer, head of analytics and computer science Jan Petržílek.
He used to work for the Security Intelligence Service.
However, the spokesman for the anti-corruption police, Jaroslav Ibehej, declined to comment on the information, knowing that the media must address the GIBS in this case.
But her spokeswoman, Radka Sandor, refused to say anything about the case, and turned to the Prague City Prosecutor's Office.
"We will not comment on this question in any way", said the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Stepanka Zenklová.
It can also be inferred from this non-specific reaction that the event took place but is in a state of secrecy that prevents the speaker from saying anything specific.
Barth's lawyer, Oldrich Poodob, is in a similar situation.
The media said Bart was represented "in this case", but since it was classified information, he could neither confirm nor deny Bart's arrest.
Some media initially speculated that Bart's arrest might be related to former police president Peter Lessey.
This was promoted by Bart together with former VV President Radek John, who was head of the Interior Ministry.
The dispute that broke out between former Prime Minister Peter Nečas and the VV had to be resolved by then-President Václav Klaus.
I don't know where that connection to me came from.
No one contacted me, no one questioned me.
"I really don't know anything about this", Lessy told iDNES.cz.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
Officially, he was promoted by Radek John, the real leader of the party, but he was Bart at the time.
Bartha was now running for the presidency for the Movement for the Rising, but narrowly missed his parliamentary term - 175 votes.
Tomorrow's leader Tomio Okamura has declared that he has no idea what this is all about.
"With Bart was one of many candidates from many parties on our candidate and as I have said repeatedly before the election, Tomia Okamura was not and is not a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy", he distanced himself from Bart Okamura, who said before the election that he gave Bart space to run for the Dawn because he helped him solve the problem of executioners.
In 2012, Barta appeared in court with his former partner from VV Jaroslav Škarka.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on board aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian airlines will continue to have to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, regardless of changes in the US, in order to ease regulations on these devices.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. airlines the opportunity to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight, provided the devices remain in air mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot access their e-books during takeoff and landing.
The Australian carriers are reviewing this decision, which requires a lot of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they have no plans to change their procedures anytime soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said that it had examined this notification but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices at critical flight stages were still in place in Australia.
CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft, it said.
This issue is covered by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers act in accordance with safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, which has already discussed with CASA the extension of its on-board Wi-Fi entertainment system, has been inclined to change but has announced that it will submit to a regulatory decision.
"We would welcome CASA to conduct an analysis of the authorisation to use electronic devices, because we really think that now that we have (wireless onboard entertainment), it would improve the customer experience", the spokesperson said.
Qantas has announced that it will comply with the current regulations for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices are not to be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no intention of changing this anytime soon", he said.
The FAA rules apply to American airlines.
But we're constantly looking at developments in regulatory areas that could be useful to our travelers, and we're definitely going to take a closer look at the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
In the case of US air carriers, the impact of the regulations will be different from company to company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile phones, as well as review manuals, training material, baggage manuals and passenger information.
Once the airline confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones, at any altitude above sea level, the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew shall instruct passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be safely placed under the seats or in a storage space above the head during take-off and landing.
With the growing middle class, mortgage shops in Singapore are flourishing
Janani Amirthalinga stops a gold bracelet, ring and earrings at a pawn shop in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore to pay her daughter for school fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house and I put all my money into it", says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she receives $2,400 a month as an administrator and her husband also works, her family's monthly income is insufficient, she says.
Demand across Southeast Asia  where household debt is increasing  is indeed such that ValueMax, where a woman conducts her business, became the third mortgage lender on the Singapore Exchange this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow  1300 SGD in cash in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga , but it's also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
The Singaporean branch normally applies an annual interest rate of 17%, which is just above the rate of 15,4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, the advantage of the banks is that they do not require a person's identity (payment history) or proof of income and can lend faster than banks.
And so as families feel pressured by rising living costs and rising household debt and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to mortgage lending.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis and low-cost loans backed by loose monetary policy, low- and middle-income families in advanced economies are turning to mortgage lending to cope with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the increasing use of credit in households, mainly due to rising rent, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest debt to GDP in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also concerned about the high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week just emerged from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued weak exports and weak consumer demand.
"The key is that with rising costs, people from the middle to low [income] will try to supplement their income wherever they can", said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB Bank in Malaysia.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have contributed to people lavishly stopping their personal possessions and taking advantage of the opportunity to exchange their family jewelry for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped at 200 pawn shops in the city are gold.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month".
The largest operator of mortgages in Thailand, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its mortgages in recent months.
The growth in the mortgage industry is so great that ValueMax, which operates a branch in downtown Bendemeer and 15 similar ones in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia  where it has four branches  but also outside Asia, says ValueMax CEO Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will finance this by using 60 percent of the 66 million SGD it received on the Singapore Exchange this week.
While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Mrs. Yeah says the charter not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but it also does not directly increase debt.
"Customers are stopping items they already own and the monetization of personal property does not increase the household's debt", he says.
In society, the asset portfolio is increasingly accepted as a means of securing short-term, secure financing.
Moreover, not only are mortgage lenders in financial distress.
Rich Singaporeans also use ValueMax branches to stop gold bars or Rolex watches, and they can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are of all sizes.
"These include wealthy individuals who need to borrow for short-term reasons for their bold business or investment, or small businesses who need help with their cash flow problems", says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money as fast as they can.
A $ 325 million rescue package for Tasmanian healthcare
The federal government insists that the $325 million rescue package for dying healthcare in Tasmania contain strict conditions to ensure the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Australian Union is taking "accelerated measures" to avert the crisis caused by the island's ageing population, higher rates of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
The funding for the four years was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian MP, Andrew Wilke.
"The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state", Mrs Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for a patient-requested surgery.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopedic and grey-cheek operations, will help to clear the debt.
The money is also available for the open clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved postoperative care, training of health professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
"These investments are a response to the ideas that leading clinicians have told me would best help the Tasmanian healthcare system", said Ms Plibersek.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian Government must require a strict reporting regime and registration obligations.
The State will have to maintain the current level of funding to receive the money from the Australian Union and report monthly on where the additional funding has been spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the State delivers services as efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that the $325 million would be of no use until a real reform is in place to lay a more sustainable foundation for Tasmania's public health system.
Nevertheless, he praised the government for its response to his request for urgent assistance, which he first raised in a meeting with the Prime Minister in early May.
"I believe the federal aid package can lift the state's public health system from a critical state", Mr. Wilkie said.
The State Government believes that these additional elected procedures will significantly reverse the recent cuts.
Federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's statement is just a slap in the face.
"The reason I'm here is because the Labour government has taken out $430 million from our health care system", he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that takes almost half a billion dollars, and an Australian Union that gives $300 million, and pretend that's good news.
Mr. Dutton has asked Mrs. Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the life-saving package will be spent on higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux adapted a novel by Denise Diderot that brings an exceptional cinematic journey and portrayal of the times, but it's also more boring than it should be.
Set in the 1860s in France, it tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman who is sent by her family to a convent.
When she rebels, she experiences extreme cruelty from a punishable mother introduced to her and becomes the object of sexual passion for another.
The film never slides into the flattery or sensuality, and that's his problem.
The ceremonial aspect of this story means that the audience will experience the same pain as wearing a harvested shirt.
Ski resorts want to make families with children less expensive
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons production facilities, says supervisory authority
Syria destroyed critical chemical weapons production equipment and poison gas munitions, the Global Chemical Weapons Oversight Committee said on Thursday, as violent conflicts erupted in the north of the country, near one of the supposedly toxic sites.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also said that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the civil war began almost three years ago.
The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons' announcement came the day before November 1,
the deadline set by that organisation in The Hague for the destruction or cessation of operation of all chemical weapons production facilities and chemical mixing machinery for the production of toxic gas and ammunition.
The completion of this basically initial phase of destruction is a major milestone in an ambitious timeline that aims to destroy all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has yet to begin destroying its existing weapons and supplies.
It is estimated that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including hyperite and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came as fighting raged in the town of Safira, which experts refer to as the headquarters of a chemical weapons factory and warehouse, on Thursday, said the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
A group of activists who monitored the total number of victims through a network of activists in Syria reported that 120,296 people died on Thursday.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
The government is expected to have 29,954 members of Bashar Assad's armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 Hezbollah militants from Lebanon.
The dead include 2,202 government fugitives and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since.
The conflict has forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad's forces have been fighting in Safiir against the rebels, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda, for weeks.
The Observatory said Thursday that losses were on both sides, but it had no specific figures.
The fighting has highlighted the dangers facing chemical weapons inspectors who, in their mission to dispose of the chemical arsenal in Syria amid the ongoing civil war, must meet tight deadlines.
A statement from the OPCW Office, which works closely with the UN, said its team is now satisfied that it has verified  and monitored the destruction  of Syria's declared critical manufacturing and mixing/fill equipment.
He added that no further control activities were currently planned.
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were unable to visit two sites because of security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that these two sites had been abandoned by Syria and ... items from the chemical weapons program that it contained were moved to two other declared sites that were being inspected.
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Saffir was one of the places the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has approved a plan to completely destroy its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
'I am proud of the courage and courage you have shown in carrying out this most challenging mission this organization has ever had,' said Director of Observers Ahmet Uzumcu in a comment issued by the OPCW Office.
Now in its third year, the main Sunni Muslim rebels and the Assad government are fighting each other in a civil war with their security forces, which are full of members of the Alawite sect, the branch of Shiite Islam.
As for further developments, Observatory Chief Ramí Abdul Rahman said that a major explosion occurred inside an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Laziqiya on Wednesday.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over the verdict on the perpetrator of the Bali bombing
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted furiously to the verdict of the last of the founders who were brought to justice, saying Umar Patek should be executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted fugitives, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for assembling an explosive device that was used in a bombing raid.
He could be paroled in 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, leaving 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty on several other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution demanded life in prison, although it could insist that a man nicknamed Demolition man (drill) be given the death penalty because of his reputation as an explosives expert.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, a Perth-based mother who lost her 39-year-old twin sisters, Jane and Jenny, in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other schoolboys nearly a decade ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
For AAP, Mrs. Corteen said, "He should be put in front of an execution squad".
Every day I have to live with the fact that I won't see any more grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was torn to shreds when a powerful charge was detonated in an outdoor-parked van shortly after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber blew up a bag full of explosives.
He went into a coma for a month as a result of the explosion, and while being kept alive, he died three times to the doctors.
Mr Hughes said Pateka should face the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell of Jam'a Islam responsible for the massacre of Amrozi, Muchalas and Imam Samudra who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one else.
Keeping him alive... no reason to keep him alive, it just isn't.
To serve 20 years for killing 202 people and injuring hundreds is not so much.
Patek was the last assassin to stand trial in Bali.
He avoided arrest for nearly a decade, but was finally caught in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where less than four months later, former al-Qaeda leader Usama bin Laden was killed by US forces.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports revealed Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish links between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give up on his own", Mrs. Corteen said.
To this day, he has not felt regret for the sorrow he caused others.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"We're going to see a lot of tears this year", Mrs. Corteen said.
Patek may appeal the verdict.
FAA: Air travellers can now use technology on planes (but not call from their mobile phones)
Airlines passengers will be able to use their electronic devices from gate to gate in addition to calling from their mobile phones to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music, according to the new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
But travelers should not expect changes to occur immediately.
How quickly the change will be implemented will vary by airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta told a news conference.
Air carriers will have to demonstrate to the FAA administration to what extent their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated the on-board crew training manuals and installation guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
Depending on the state of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly,the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices as soon as the doors of an aircraft are closed.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches a height of three kilometers and the captain gives permission.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the aircraft lands to land and not to turn them on until the aircraft is on the ground.
The FAA stated that the new rules allow airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference to allow their passengers to use their facilities during take-off, landing and take-off.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft which have been adapted to enable passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Stewardship Association, welcomed the changes.
"Once the new rules are safely implemented and we work closely with transport companies on this, it will be a success", Glading said in a statement.
We're already tired of looking like guards, to be honest.
However, surfing the Internet, sending emails and text messages or downloading data will continue to be prohibited below 3 kilometers above sea level, the agency said.
Passengers will be advised to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to air mode.
So still no Words with Friends, an online scrabble game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he was, as is well known, thrown off an American Airlines plane for refusing to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will have to continue to be stored because of fears that they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls will continue to be prohibited on board.
The rules for using mobile phones are not set by the FAA, but by the Federal Communications Commission.
The FAA may lift off the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Committee on Transportation Safety, a national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said that mobile phones continue to be considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigation devices, but we also know from FCC data that they can interfere with broadcast towers in the air", Rosenker said.
The FAA's advisory panel, set up to investigate the issue, last month proposed that the government allow for the wider use of electronic devices.
In recent years, the FAA has been under pressure to ease restrictions on its use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, argue that there is no legitimate security reason for this ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce as the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of travelers forget or ignore the requirement to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to disruption of navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, a technical feat of the time.
New airlines are much more reliant on electrical systems than previous generation aircraft, but they are also designed, and approved by the FAA, to be resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi to passengers at sea altitudes for several years.
Plans adapted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt to greater use of electronic devices under the new rules, Huert said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much less radio-intensive radiation than those of previous generations.
For example, electronic readers emit only minimal radio emissions when a page is turned.
But the transmission is stronger when the devices download or send data.
Among those pushing for the easing of restrictions on the use of these devices by travelers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of this company loaded the aircraft with their Kindle electronic readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem emerged.
The FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities represented any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passenger Association said he was convinced that the disruption from these facilities was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members stated that there are only fragmentary reports from pilots to support the fact that such equipment can cause disruption to air systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off their devices during flight by means of low visibility instruments.
The tourism industry group welcomed these changes and considered it a reasonable approach for the traveling public to make extensive use of the technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that a pleasant travel experience is not at odds with safety", said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was airlifted from the North Sea drilling rig and released back into the wild
The bird was brought to shore after being found exhausted on the Black Sea oil rig and released back into the wild.
One of the battalions was flown to Aberdeen last month by helicopter after being treated by the Scottish company SPCA at the emergency centre until he recovered.
Operations manager Colin Seddon said: "This creature was probably migrating from northern Europe when it was caught by a strong wind over the North Sea".
Apparently, he ran out of strength and took refuge on the oil rig.
Mr. Seddon added: "He was unable to take off again, so they contacted us for help".
At the time of his release, he was in good health and health.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing businesses together and defining what changes in the EU relationship British entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see.
To this end, we have conducted the largest and most comprehensive survey of leading British businessmen asking their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov surveyed 1,000 leading UK businesses of all sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see the government prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil over a long and arduous process of reforming secret European institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy areas  from monopoly regulation to product laws , most entrepreneurs expressed the view that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulations now outweighed the benefits of being part of the European trading area  Even 40% of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European, agreed.
And finally, our survey of leading companies revealed the most persuasive knowledge, and it's clear that the majority wants Britain to strive to change the treaty and the relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings, which identified businesses of different sizes and major business groups, suggest that the business sector is pushing for a 'meaningful change' that will bring its impact back to Britain.
There is a lot at stake  to achieve a change in the treaty and a better deal for Britain could mean a gain of up to 16% in the EU referendum.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to renew the terms of British EU membership.
It also shows that the business sector expects this innovation to represent a significant shift away from the current balance of power back towards the UK.
A better deal is possible for Britain and increasingly necessary as the euro area embarks on a path towards a narrower economic and fiscal union.
Jobs and growth in the UK must be a priority, and as our survey results show, for businesses this means a refocus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
John Kerry admitted, "The spy has gone too far!"
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in espionage, U.S. diplomat John Kerry admitted during a video conference between Washington and London.
But the intelligence gathering, according to the minister, has been used to deter terrorist attacks.
The "first confession from Washington" was made amid heated controversy on both sides of the Atlantic over the scandalous revelation of a massive surveillance of data by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which has targeted US allies.
"In some cases, I admit, as President Obama has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we're making sure that doesn't happen in the future", Kerry said.
But in the interview, he was primarily advocating for the practice so far.
It considers that information is necessary to combat terrorism and prevent attacks such as the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the USA, the Madrid attacks of March 2004 or the London attacks of July 2005.
"We prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being killed because we were able to be informed of the tasks in time", Kerry stressed.
However, he reiterated that the information collection "has in some cases gone disproportionately far".
An affair involving American intelligence, which reportedly tracked hundreds of millions of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turns out that the Americans were also tracking the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders have not been hiding their anger, and some have called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would prohibit or significantly limit surveillance.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says that the pipeline in Bulgaria is ushering in a new era of gas
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said Gazprom's director.
"Today we are witnessing a milestone: construction has begun on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe", said Gazprom President Alexei Miller in a statement.
This project is a key element of energy security across the European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to the Russian export routes through Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian partners, which imports most of Russia's gas to Europe, adds to the risks of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says that a direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" eliminated.
Once the entire project is operational in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says construction is set to begin in other countries later this year.
The pipeline is designed to have an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
There's a decisive battle ahead.
Lebanon's Hezbollah has deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for the decisive battle for the Kalamun mountainous region.
According to increasingly accurate reports, Israel destroyed rockets targeting Hezbollah in Wednesday's airstrikes on two sites in western Syria.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the Lebanese army.
Its program is also to fight Israel, which is not involved in the Syrian conflict, but has made it clear that it will prevent the transfer of arms to Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Reports of Israeli strikes on weapons depots in western Syria on Wednesday are only being clarified.
Israel has not commented on the attack, but American sources have confirmed it.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, missiles fired from the Mediterranean region hit the Syrian Snubar Jabla missile base south of Latakia.
Al-Arabiya news agency says two warehouses where missiles were ready to be transported to Lebanon were hit.
According to her sources, they were Russian-made SA-8 missiles.
Israel declined to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron Ben-Jish said Syria was continually trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian Air Force was teaching Hezbollah's armed wing to handle missiles.
The SA-8s are outdated missiles that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They're placed on a moving chassis.
Although they are relatively primitive, they are easily concealed because of their mobility and small size.
They're equipped with radar, but it turns off after firing, so it's hard to target them.
Latakia is located in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling Alawites.
This is a well-guarded area, and Hezbollah has been involved in the fighting in western Syria in the past.
He claims to be helping protect the Syrian Shiite community, to which the Alawites belong.
Now, he's reportedly got 15,000 of his fighters ready to help him take back Kalamun.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its forces there.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and the third largest city in the country, Homs.
The battle is said to be in retaliation for the recent attack by the opposition on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite brigade Abu Fadl Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army recapture the town of Kusair on the Lebanese border this year.
Many of the Kusayra rebels have just left for Kalamun.
Until recently, it seemed that most citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
The reasons for this were corruption, money laundering, overpriced purchases, and government procurement, as well as tax increases, and, last but not least, government scandals.
The results of the elections suggest that the majority of citizens were in favour of this situation.
That they didn't really care and that they were actually happy with the state of affairs that was there (robbing and indebted to this state).
I cannot explain otherwise that 3 413 497 voters did not vote, 596 357 voted TOP 09 384 174 voted ODS, so a total of 4 394 028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52,16% of all eligible voters.
Which is a half majority.
If I add to the above parties 1 016 829 voters of the CFSP, then with the old order (since all of these parties participated in the 'robbery' and indebtedness of that state), then in fact 64,23% of eligible voters agreed with this state.
In fact, most voters have indicated that they are not for punishing the guilty by robbing and over-indebted this state.
Or do you think the members of the CSSD who were involved will be sitting on the appropriate laws?
Is there any help?

The Royal Commission has learned that two members of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) have been charged in the lawsuits against Jonathan Lord
The Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse learned that before the charges against Caringbah child educator Jonathan Lord were brought in 2011, two employees of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in New South Wales had been charged with child sexual abuse.
But the committee noted that in its opening statement to the committee, the association said that it had never dealt with a child sexual abuse case in its organization.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked about the case of one of the YMCA staff being accused of child pornography offences and another where a YMCA bodybuilder in Caringbah was convicted in 1991 of sexually abusing children in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, the commission's counsel, that he knew about the first case, but not the second.
It acknowledged that the initial statement of the YMCA was also inaccurate when it stated that external audits were carried out at the YMCA which praised the organisation as a leading advocate for children's rights.
The evidence presented by the Commission shows that the YMCA was alerted that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in the Ministry of Education and Society audit of August this year.
Mr Hare, who started with the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that his own leadership failed downward when Mr. Lord accepted the position without making sure that the staff were aware of the obligation to report child safety violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexually abusing 12 boys committed during his two years at the YMCA.
He was jailed for a minimum of six years.
Mr Hare, however, rejected the allegation that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting a violation of the safety of children by Mr. Lord.
Staff members provided evidence of such violations, including that Lord was alone with the children, privately watching over them, letting them sit on his lap, telling them he loved them, and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and requested child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, the head of child services at the YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was very intimidating and often difficult to talk to.
The CEO said he doesn't accept evidence of staff feeling unconscious if they should contact their superiors and report their actions.
Instead, he said their friendship with the Lord had clouded their judgment, and therefore they did not report the problem.
Mr Hare said he had told the YMCA Council in New South Wales that the lesson for the organisation from the Jonathan Lord case was that staff had not submitted any reports and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to have staff sign a non-disclosure agreement shortly after the allegations emerged was made by YMCA's General Manager of Children's Services, Liam Whitley.
He said the goal was to avoid tampering with the evidence, but it was overly zealous and poorly executed.
Child sexual abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission that the YMCA in New South Wales was not a safe organization for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems with recruiting, verifying, recruiting, training and staffing.
The hearing has been postponed to December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return to the post of prime minister, but admitted that his return was unlikely.
In a late-night interview on the fifth anniversary of his departure, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after ten years at the helm, Mr Blair has largely avoided talks on British politics, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as an envoy for the Middle East Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of prime minister, his answer to the London Evening Standard was: "Yes, of course, but it's hard to believe, so...
As teams of horse racing experts gathered in Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year award, it was clear to all that the race would not be easy.
But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he is not yet in school and only made his first steps a few months ago, this boy and his pet pet, the Shetland Pony Toffee, smoothly rolled three wheels to finally win the grand prize, leaving behind 30 dragging adult competitors.
This indissoluble pair  of equal height  was lauded for their appearance, behavior and style in the annual competition run by the Sunnybank Riding Centre in Rudra village near Cardiff.
He stood up to the gentlemen and ladies in fancy hats, tapped his baret into a cheerful angle, and let his two-year-old Toffee walk around the circle.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural ability to drive horses that far exceed his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for his vision and personality.
He got Fenton Toffee for his third birthday in March and has been practicing with this Shetland pony every day since.
His mother Donna (30) said, "Fenton and Toffee work great together.
They didn't have much hope, but they finally left with a gold cup and flowers.
It was only the second time he'd competed with Toffe, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone thought he was phenomenal, and people who were completely strangers wanted to take pictures with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been riding horses for over 10 years.
Mrs Howells says, "There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone cheered and applauded".
He ran the entire length of the arena, and despite his small size, he did a great job.
Fenton is an animal obsessed with horses, tractors and a farm and has two chickens in charge.
Given how he started, he'll be back in the Horse of the Year race soon, and I'm sure he'll do well.
The spokesman for the annual horse show said, "The Fentons are only three, but they already know how to control a pony".
They make a great team together.
The jury praised Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and the way they performed on the competition circuit.
They're always watching how good the teamwork is between the pony and the one who runs it and Fenton and Toffey were the best on the oval.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by the lovely clothes, really fit in with him.
Too curious newspapers to be investigated
The Chinese newspapers that have been on the front page asking for the release of a reporter accused of slander will be thoroughly investigated, the press secretary said.
The New Express, based in Guangzhou, has made a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he took bribes to make up stories about a state-owned company.
The editor said the New Express will now make a full correction.
The order for the amendment came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Kuang-tung Province.
The preliminary investigation showed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express of the Yangtze Evening News Group published several false reports about Zoomlion.
"The editorial board of the New Express was disorganized", the manager said in a statement.
He said he had to decide to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by revoking his journalism license.
He also ordered the Yangtze Evening News Group to conduct a general correction of the New Express and recommended that the relevant New Express officials be investigated and that the New Express' management be changed immediately.
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express about financial irregularities at a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspapers published two requests for his release on the front page, claiming that he was behind his journalistic work.
But then Mr. Chen appeared on state television and admitted to making false stories for a bribe.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion and the entire media industry and its ability to gain public trust", he told state news station CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realize I've been wrong.
After Mr. Chen apologized, he issued a New Express cover letter saying he had failed to do enough to check his messages.
Recently, a number of highly-tracked suspects have made a television confession.
Experts say confessions are still regularly enforced, despite this year's law change, which prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves.
A tunnel was found for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico with its own railroad.
One of the most industrial drug trafficking tunnels between the United States and Mexico has been built, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail.
U.S. officials described the tunnel, about one meter by one meter, as one of the most elaborate secret corridors they've ever discovered.
The tunnel, which spans nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, U.S.A.
This area is full of undefined warehouses, where trucks can be easily hidden before they load drugs.
The authorities said the tunnel was closed before drugs could have been smuggled in.
Along with the tunnel, authorities also seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men who were working as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with the intent to distribute them.
If convicted, he faces a sentence of 10 years to life in prison.
In the town of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers are breaking into vast drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after a marijuana harvest in central Mexico posed a problem to drug cartels about how to get their product to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, authorities found a 600-foot [6,500 m] corridor with railroads that led from the kitchen of one home in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economics and the Center connect management.
For example, they offer joint advertising
The new integrated newsroom of Economia in Prague's Karlín.
Economia has taken another step toward transforming its holding company Centrum into its media house.
Since Friday, Economia and the Center have shared top management.
"The unification of the organisational structure and the staff union is essential for the integration of both publishers into a common media house", comments the changes made by the Vice-President of the Board of Economy and the Acting CEO Kamil Čermák.
Mr. Germaine, who will be the head of the single management, will be joined by Andreas Demuth, CEO of Centrum Holdings.
Pavel Vopařil has been appointed as the new joint director of the business, to whom the interim director of both companies, Zuzana Tylčerová, is also subordinate.
The new head of information technology is Stepan Burda.
The co-editor-in-chief is Vladimir Piskáček, whose team also includes the director of transformation Jakub Unger.
The newly created position of Marketing Director was assigned to Adele Pitts.
The separate corporate communications department is now run by Vera Lhotská.
The joint CFO is Karel Žalud, and the human resources management for both publishers is headed by Petra Slabá.
'The new organisational structure will enable us, inter alia, to enter the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better link the content of all titles published and, last but not least, to significantly improve the company's business management', added Tsermak.
Economia, owned by financier Zdeněk Bakala, entered into a contract to acquire Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April this year.
The Centrum Holdings portfolio consists of the Aktuálně.cz, Žena.cz servers, web portals, an extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and the Najisto SMB agency, or a portfolio of almost two dozen smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of the Economy newspaper, the news server IHNED.cz, the weekly magazines Respekt and Ekonom and a number of print and online B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, it has long been the most successful in selling digital versions of its main titles.
In June this year, the publishing house moved into a newly built modern building in Karlín, Prague.
CME is targeting the television business.
He'll release almost a quarter of the people.
CME Media Group is going to release him.
He wants to lose a thousand people by the end of the year.
Osekat plans all of her side activities and wants to focus on her main business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of about 4 500 people.
That's how nearly a quarter of people lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME is part of CET 21, which holds licences for the broadcasting of TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and the Czech version of the music station MTV.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the local TV channel TV Nova, is not yet clear.
"This is premature and we really can't comment on it", said the communications director of the New Josef Koukolíček.
According to MF DNES, the significant dismissal of the Czech Republic is certainly not to be avoided, but it should have by far the greatest impact on the staffing of CME's branches in Romania and other countries.
Both new bosses of Nova Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who took over from longtime CEO Adrian Sarbu, spoke during a conference call with analysts on Wednesday about their desire to curb all activities that are not directly related to the television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce the costs of producing its own programmes, filmmaking and production activities in particular.
In the industrial area of the Czech Republic in Prague, a cooling tower burned down at night
A large storage tank burned in the industrial area of the Czech Republic's Prague district, according to firefighters, apparently a cooling tower.
"The firefighters had already left the fire on Thursday before 11 p.m. and were still extinguishing the fire this morning", said Pavlina Adamc, a Prague firefighters spokeswoman.
The amount of pollutants in the ambient air measured does not exceed the permitted limits.
The extent of the damage and the cause of the fire are unknown.
About five dozen firefighters gradually arrived at the site on Kolbenov Street.
"This is a large-capacity storage tank fire, probably a cooling tower", Adamc said.
"There is no functional hydrant network on the premises, so we're switching off the lights using the cisterna piping", she added.
According to the server tn.cz, the firefighters had to transport the water from elsewhere because the fire hydrant network was malfunctioning.
The fire chief's call for second-degree fire alarm.
There are four degrees in total, and in the most serious cases, the fourth is declared.
Chemists also arrived to check the level of hazardous substances that could have been released into the air during the fire.
"But they did not measure the amount of pollutants in the air that would exceed hygiene standards", said a fire department spokeswoman.
The British police have sent Assange a release order.
British police today delivered a release notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who had taken refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he had applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had delivered a release notice to the 40-year-old Australian asking him to report to the police station and that he could face arrest if he did not.
Assange exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court this month overturned his appeal against extradition, and he is now facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he sought refuge on June 19 at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum in this South American country.
Scotland Yard has handed over a release notice to a 40-year-old man asking him to appear at the police station on the day and time he was scheduled to, a spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate the terms of his bail.
The Embassy declined to comment on the submission of the release notice.
Assange is afraid he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he may face charges of espionage, because he published 250,000 US diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
A driver was fined £1,000 for driving over 200km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
A motorist was fined £1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found out he had a cup of booze between his thighs.
In Colchester Police Court, Howie pleaded guilty to driving unwarranted and carelessly.
Seven points were added to his account, resulting in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay costs of £90 and a surcharge of £100 for the accused.
The London bubble is bursting with a tax on foreign property owners
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the tax on the income of financial assets, but it is awaiting a final decision by Mr Osborn, who introduced a 7% fee for the transfer of real estate for buildings over £2 million in the 2012 budget and annual fees for buyers who own real estate within the company, not as individuals.
The income from the transfer fee in the housing fund in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which reached £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: Given the increase in the transfer of high value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax evasion, it is very difficult to argue that high value property is under tax regardless of the effect of the outdated head tax system.
He added that this move could have caused some foreign investors to hesitate to buy or sell London properties.
The forefront properties  above 5% to 10% of the housing market by price  in the rich belt from Fulham to Wimbledon saw a record 11.8% increase last year.
Prices in central London continue to show a year-on-year steady growth of 5.6%, but have been overshadowed by a thriving domestic market, where, according to a survey by Savills, the South West, North (7.4%) and East (6.5%) have seen increases.
Scientists have shed more light on how tail movements are related to a dog's mood
Previous research has shown that happy dogs swing their tails more to the right (from a dog's point of view), while nervous dogs swing their tails mostly to the left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences in tail movement.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at Trent University, said: "It is well known that the left and right sides of the brain have different responses to stimuli that trigger positive or negative emotions.
We've tried to observe the same thing in other species.
He added that just as in humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to gain more information about how dogs respond to the disproportionate tail drilling of other dogs, researchers monitored animals who watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the pulse frequency of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will probably not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have given dogs films about dogs, either in natural form or in silhouette, to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we have also been able to adjust tail movement and show it more to the right or left".
When the animals saw an otherwise unobtrusive dog moving its tail to the right (from the dog's point of view), they remained completely calm.
But when she saw the tail turn mostly to the left (again from the dog's tail-turning point of view), their pulse rate increased and the animals became uncertain.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think dogs would communicate with each other consciously through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience what movements they must and must not watch.
He said, "If you meet dogs several times and their tail movement in one direction is repeatedly associated with more friendly behavior and the movement to the right produces less friendly behavior, you will react based on that experience".
Researchers say that the findings can help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers better understand their animals' emotions.
John Bradshaw, a dog behavior expert and a professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study to examine whether the left and right sides were important to dogs.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they observe an aggressive dog, and to the right when they look at a cheerful dog.
And in another paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said, "Dogs were more likely to meet a dog robot when he was digging his tail to the left than to the right, when they were more uncertain than they were in the opposite direction from the Italian study".
He thinks the difference can be made by the fact that in these different animal studies, dogs didn't play like dogs in movies or dog robots.
He explained that a study of how dogs react to real dogs could help.
While there is strong evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes in many different mammals, many details still need to be clarified and dogs are no exception, he said.
But given how easy it is to track their behavior, it is likely that it will not take long to understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
The Arctic Monkeys have postponed their Glasgow concert due to Alex Turner's illness.
The rock band Arctic Monkeys moved their Glasgow gig after the lead singer was diagnosed with a herniated disc.
The Sheffield band was supposed to perform at the Hydro City Complex on Friday.
But lead singer Alex Turner's illness forced her to move the show.
The group's announcement came after they were similarly forced to postpone their performance Thursday at the LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys said: "After the decision to postpone today's performance at LG Arena in Birmingham and on medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must postpone their performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday, November 1.
Alex Turner has been diagnosed with a herniated disc and unfortunately cannot get out.
The performance will take place at the LG Arena in Birmingham on 20 November and the performance at the Hydro Complex in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets to this performance remain valid.
We'd like to apologize to all those who bought tickets for the inconvenience this has caused them.

Pope Francis appoints the first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced Thursday that Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22.
The cardinals are the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church right after the pope and are the ones who elect the pope, so Francis will establish his first group of men who will eventually help choose his successor.
There are 201 cardinals now.
However, once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope  the group is reduced to 120 electing cardinals.
In a statement announcing the report, Father Federico Lombardi, the Vatican's spokesman, said that before the solemn elevation of the new cardinals, a gathering of current cardinals known as the Consistory will be held.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance to facilitate planning for other assemblies that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world", Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinals elected is likely to drop by February.
He said the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as he wants to increase the number of electors to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
The consortium next year will be significant because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
At this moment, there is a certain orientation towards Europe, particularly towards Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance", he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of cardinals since Francis established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope made all the decisions for himself.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him", Valero said.
He said it was quite possible that these cardinals would be asked for advice by the Pope.
But we've never been in this situation before.
Valero said that the popes traditionally elevated bishops from big places to cardinals, but Francis is full of surprises, so we don't know who he's naming.
GM is pulling some new light trucks in the U.S. for seatback repairs.
According to a Friday announcement from the U.S. Auto Safety Authority, General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light trucks to repair a manual suspension failure.
In some of these vehicles the front seat clamping mechanism may be faulty.
As a result, the seat backs do not comply with federal safety standards for head restraints.
A notice on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website says that if a vehicle is hit from behind, the head restraint may not properly protect the passengers, increasing the risk of injury.
The models withdrawn were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
GM launched the delivery in June and for this leading American carmaker it is the most important launch of a vehicle since the restructuring and bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owner of the van of the fault in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the owner's notification due to a 16-day government inactivity that weakened car sales growth in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra, which were redesigned for the 2014 models, rose to about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra models of its fleet.
New York Stock Exchange stocks rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
The desperate scream of the Obama voters
I voted for Obama twice. I shared my hope for change.
He says Obama's sincere efforts have overcome the Republican Party's obstacles.
Obstruction policy can't excuse the passions of the Obama Healthcare website or drone strikes.
Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a sophomore in medical school at Harvard.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
I thought about this book that during the dark days of my sophomore year of medical school, it would encourage me and restore a little hope to me.
It's called The Audacity to Win (Drawn to Victory) and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patient reviews tonight and go to bed, the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches took your breath away.
The election ended in a landslide, and the television news forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.
My classmates were crying for joy, and my parents were hiding the newspapers they had found.
A young team of visionaries headed for the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had 82 percent support.
And here I close the book.
Moving into the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It's hard to remember those optimistic days... seem like distant memories, sad memories of missed opportunities.
In the years since I put my first ballot, there have been changes.
It was definitely not what I imagined.
I recognize that Obama has made a number of great and varied achievements -- from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the no-questions, no-say policy after the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
And I'm convinced that party obstructions have reversed so many efforts to move our nation forward: among other things, immigration reform, public health care options, and the closure of the Guantanamo base.
But after many times defending the Obama administration in front of colleagues and friends, I've reached an absolute limit on the explanations they can provide.
I felt like I was in a place of political hopelessness.
Republican obstructions cannot explain their consent to foreign leaders being interrogated or drone strikes killing innocent children overseas.
They can't explain why the NSA collects data on Americans' private lives or why it pursues those who expose government wrongdoing.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a proper trial or for the restriction of public contributions and spending during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify the findings of a report that the White House's efforts to silence the media are more aggressive than the Nixon administration.
And most recently, they can't even excuse the inability to create a simple website more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.
I don't know if I could have expected that.
I guess I should have guessed at 18 that government power could be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it.
The elected office obviously has no predictable course and our public talks will be shaped by the opposition political party and random events like the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the result of the administration's own decision.
And that's what's bothering me the most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a messy and unfinished alternative and seemed unable to consolidate his policies or position.
I felt that Obama's second term, free from the pressures of the next election, would fill the hopes we've heard about.
Yet it's getting harder to get back to 2008  with support for Obama falling below 45%  this week through this book.
It makes me think of all the promises that have been lost.
This week, I read a chapter in a book about Obama's brutal defeat of Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
At an additional campaign meeting, he told his staff that he needed to get back on track and stay true to his mission.
I want our spell back, he said.
We mustn't forget who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are purely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest over the parental leave program.
Billionaire and lawmaker Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict over the parental leave program because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
A mining tycoon who is fighting a $6 million tax bill for coal made this claim when he tried to get the question of whether there was a conflict of interest off the table.
The Palmer United Party may have up to four votes in the Senate, which play a key role in deciding whether to levy taxes on coal and mining.
But Mr Palmer argued that only ministers could be in conflict of interest, adding that Abbott's daughters were in a position to benefit from the policy.
"He's gotten into a big conflict of interest with regards to paid parental leave because if any of his daughters get pregnant, he'd have a direct interest in getting parental leave", Mr Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission, after counting the votes, officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the Fairfax County seat on the Sunshine Coast by a margin of 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer has called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the polling stations close?
"We need a better system", he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, tap into the details on your computer, vote instantly, and get the results at 7:30 p.m.?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pens to mark ballot papers.
Is it that results can be rubbed off if someone doesn't like them?
These days and times, using pens seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission has been studying the possibilities of electronic voting and recently published a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said his political agenda also applied to the Sunshine Coast airport and that he would take his new job very seriously.
The public office is a public service.
"We are not seeking any reward except that we can serve society at this critical time", he said.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have found that hand washing can change your mind.
The experiment involved 98 people divided into three groups.
The first two were to solve an unsolvable task.
Of course, neither of them worked.
But the group that washed their hands after failing to do so had a much more optimistic impression than the group that did not wash their hands.
The "hand washed" group also performed better than the other in the next test.
Yet, those who washed their hands had worse results in other tests than those who did not.
The results of the 'washed' were at the level of the third group, whose participants had no previous failure.
According to psychologists, the results of the test show that physical cleanliness really removes negative feelings after failure.
But at the same time, motivation is decreasing, and the test subjects have to focus a lot more on their next test.
If we were to transfer the results of the research to the Czech Republic, we'd probably be more optimistic when we get back from the toilet.
After using the toilet, only one percent of Czechs and Czechs wash their hands, but by the time they use city transport, that number is already one fifth.
They also often stick to hygiene after working in the garden or in a workshop, where 85 percent of people wash their hands.
The comfort of a pet motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks of the need to wash their hands after reaching out to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8% of Czechs and 40.3% of Slovaks wash their hands.
A survey showed that both nations wash their hands about 10 times a day.
"Although it would be appropriate, I'm afraid the reality is different and people are trying to do a little better", commented study results dermatologist Claudia Komarkova.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
According to two persons familiar with the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is suspending two traders in its foreign currency division, another indication that global investigations by the regulatory authorities into suspected currency market manipulation are becoming more frequent.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with the competent authorities in investigating the world's largest financial market, which changes owners by $5.3 trillion every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees suspended in the context of an expanding investigation that is a response to the LIBOR (London Interbank Rate) manipulation scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension but confirmed that it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
"Our relentless search on this matter continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other authorities", the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the incident said that RBS had sent the UK Financial Conduct Authority records of emails and instant messages sent from the accounts and to the accounts of the former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been relieved of his current position as European Chairman of Foreign Exchange Trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European Chairman of Cash Trading at Citi, took a leave of absence this week, while Matt Gardiner, former head of Currency Trading at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any offence.
Mr. Usher's rapid messaging team included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, people familiar with the event said.
UBS said this week that after the Swiss supervisory authority Finma announced that it was investigating suspected foreign exchange market manipulation in several Swiss banks, it had taken action against some of its employees.
At least six agencies worldwide  The European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antitrust agency Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority  are investigating claims that these bankers have joined forces to move the currency market.
In addition, the Commission has concluded that the Commission has not yet established a specific methodology for the assessment of the compatibility of the aid.
Banks have been scrubbing through years of old speedy messages and emails to find cases of wrongdoing.
Reports of the investigations have alarmed traders in an area that has been one of the biggest providers of investment bank closures in recent years but has been disrupted by a small currency volatility that has limited opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to defuse the situation by claiming that with a large and highly liquid foreign exchange market, it is virtually impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that may not necessarily be true.
A high-ranking trader said that despite the significant volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the liquidity of the various trading platforms and the increasing use of banks' own internal platforms means that you can start to influence the market at relatively low prices.
The report came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired this week from its stock trading division a trader who had caused a loss of almost $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank has immediately notified the competent authorities and cooperates with their supervisory authorities.
"We are convinced that this trader acted alone and that this problem was solved", said Credit Suisse.
HIV infection in Prague has exceeded 1,000
Doctors in Prague have already registered more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the start of the follow-up in 1986 to the end of the third quarter of this year, tests confirmed the infection in a total of 1,005 people in the metropolis.
This is from statistics from the National AIDS Reference Laboratory of the National Institutes of Health.
According to her, there have been 2,063 cases so far in the Czech Republic.
In 396 cases, the disease of immune failure has already broken out.
198 people died.
The number of infected people in the Czech Republic has been increasing every year for the past decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed 50 cases, and five years later, there were 121.
In 2009, 156 new infections were detected, and in 2010, 180 new infections were detected.
Last year, the number dropped to 153, but last year, it was a record.
The lab said there were 212.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases this year will exceed 200, I think there is no doubt about it anymore", says AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who for years led the Prague House of Light for Patients.
From October to the end of 2011, tests revealed the disease in 39 people, and last year in 47, Head said.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three new patients.
From the start of the follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests confirmed 1710 men and 353 women.
AIDS has spread to 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
If you really want to know a city, you should go to the cemetery.
His visit reveals more than a walk through a packed center of monuments, churches and galleries, more than a reveal of nothingness.
Many people "read from the graves".
The graveyards are slowly winding down and gaining an intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what kind of people live here, what nationalities, what faiths, how big and cohesive families they belong to, at what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
The way they express their social status, their taste.
And from the state of the tombs, he will learn how the survivors care for their dead.
The Supreme Court upheld Obama's health care law
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the health care law signed by Barack Obama is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
By a vote of 5:4, the court ruled that the individual regulation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  which requires citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014 or otherwise threaten to pay a fine  does not contradict the Constitution on the basis of government tax powers.
The president of the court, John Roberts, sided with the four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The Court also upheld the remainder of the 2700-page law and further ruled that the statutory healthcare requirement that states are required to extend the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance otherwise threatens to deprive all funding for sickness insurance from federal sources is not compulsory and unconstitutional.
The lawsuit to block this law was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises.
During the 2012 primary, the bill was strongly rejected by every major Republican candidate, including the projected nominee Mitt Romney.
"Mugabe is a cocky ass" is no longer a prison sentence, the court struck down the law
So far, Zimbabweans have had to pay close attention to publicly speaking about the 90-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s and has led it since late 1987.
Section 33 of the Criminal Code provides that a person who disrespects the office of the president could be fined $100 and sentenced to one year in prison.
"Public prosecutors should not be blaming people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places", the Constitutional Court spokesmen said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
The government is likely to appeal the court's decision, the BBC reported.
The law has been criticized by a number of Zimbabweans, including Tendai Danga, who was arrested by police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president during a bar fight with a police officer.
In May, an opposition activist who publicly praised Mugabe for his "rolling donkey" was jailed.
In August, the prosecutor charged a 26-year-old man with intent to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as toilet paper.
The court also declared it unconstitutional to restrict media freedom.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements are later proven false", said Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala.
Zimbabwe's law has so far allowed for a person to be sentenced to 20 years in prison for publishing false information.
"The existence of a law that allows someone to be criminalised for making false statements has a chilling effect on the right to free speech", Malala added.
Despite Mugabe's rule of the country for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with broader civil liberties in a referendum in March.
Small steps towards the dictatorship of one man's country began in 2009, when a deal between Mugabe and the opposition elevated Morgan Tsvangirai to the prime minister's chair.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and until 2008 the highest inflation rate in the world, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
The government therefore abolished the national currency altogether in 2009.
Today, Zimbabwe only pays in other countries' currencies.
The impoverished economy is heading towards Mugabe's ruthless agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers between his supporters and war veterans.
But most of them had no experience with farming.
Central banks will keep the swap lines going
Interim and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent tool that will allow banks access to global currencies whenever they need to.
The banks said so in their joint statement.
"It's a very sensible move", commented Julian Callow, chief international economist at London's Barclays Bank.
"So far, all transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so it is not surprising to me", adds Vojtěch Benda, chief economist at BH Securities.
Central bankers are strengthening the bond that began to form in 2007 when the international credit market first collapsed.
Central bank agreements have allowed access to euros, dollars and other currencies for anyone who needed them.
The central bankers' decision comes as the Fed prepares to end its program of support for the U.S. economy, which could push the price of money even higher on the global market.
The swap contract is normally used to overcome the liquidity shortfall of one currency with the current liquidity surplus of another currency.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a loan of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in the European banks.
The EU has agreed to banking supervision, the ECB will supervise 150 banks.
How Tipsport does not delete personal data.
Over a year ago, I made a registration on Tipsport.cz.
But I didn't finish it because there was someone sitting at the branch who couldn't finish the internet registration.
And because I didn't want to go to another branch, my license was invalidated, so I moved and changed my address and my ID number.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that I couldn't because I had a different OP number, address and that I just couldn't complete it and that I had to request that the data be deleted and that I have to make a new registration.
So I did and on October 24, 2013, I wrote to technical support requesting that all my personal data be deleted from the database under the applicable data protection law.
I got a technical support letter that said I need to complete my registration at the branch.
That started a marathon of technical support emails, where they finally wrote after the fourth emergency on October 25 that they had deleted personal data at my request.
So you'd think you could do that new registration and then the problems started again, first it wrote me that my username was already filled (I don't understand it was deleted - it's not personal data, but they eventually deleted this one).
So I used a different username and realized that my personal data was already stored to complete the registration at the branch (how could they have stored something they claim to have deleted?), so I contacted technical support again.
When I asked how it was possible, they replied that they actually deleted my personal data on 25/10 and that I should send an email with that error.
I did it (about 3pm yesterday) and they wrote back to me today that I registered the same day (October 31, 2013) at 1:22pm and that's why it can't be done because I used the same name and date of birth.
I've been contacting technical support for a week and dealing with them that it's still not working.
And what about if what he says is true (as if it isn't) then no one with the same name or date of birth could register if that was already registered.
By the way, at 1:22 p.m., I actually registered, with the same name and date of birth, but I used a fake email and phone number and the world was amazed, I found a page that emailed me a link to complete my registration.
But how is that possible if you can't register with the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport is tied to email and phone number registration and just didn't list the data as they claim.
So I told tech support again that they're just lying (either intentionally or they don't know what they're writing), because what they're writing isn't true.
I've put a couple of screens in that the registration problem was already there before Oct. 31, so the "false" registration just doesn't affect this.
Tipsport wrote me a hard line on that-- I'm sorry, but since you're already registered again, we can't verify your claim.
And he's finished communicating.
He repeats the same sentence over and over again, saying that registration is based on name and date of birth.
They can't even accept the fact that the registration wasn't completed by clicking on that link in the email and so it didn't actually happen.
So to sum it up, not only did Tipsport not erase the data as he claims, but he also lies when he claims otherwise.
Worse, they can easily prove how they're lying and try to make it look like the customer's fault.
By the way, after posting this on my personal blog, things got a little bumpy and an email came from Technical Support that they were handing over the matter for review and I'll be notified (after a week of urgency and speculation and warning of the same error).
♪ Music playing on the subway on the Bridge ♪
The Prague Municipal Transport Corporation (DPP) has launched the Music in the Subway project.
The first vestibule where instrumental music is played continuously during the operation of the subway is the Bridge of Line A at the exit to Václav Square.
The test operation will take six months.
Michal Horáček has presented his new double album, band and three singers
The composer Michal Horáček brought to the hall of the Cologne Municipal Social House not only his completely new two-CD Czech Calendar, but above all in the show Between Us singers Lenko Nova, Františka Segrada and Ondru Ruml accompanied by the excellent Orchestra Matěje Bank.
After the opening intro and the stage euphoria about a late musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, coming himself with a candle in his hand and recalling the story of the last time they played in Cologne and the theater and the whole city went out of power.
"In Cologne, they made two kinds of cards, with which I came in close contact", he recalled.
He also reminded me of President Zeman's cousin.
"Maybe we could tour the Zákolany or Dubravce in Bratislava", he joked about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, the Horoscope, who had not left the stage and sat at a table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical act.
And Joseph Manes made the calendar, and he put it on the clock, about ice hockey, but he didn't know at the time how we met in those squares and chanted, "Who doesn't jump, is not Czech".
"That's the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we're not playing it here tonight".
But Ondra Ruml sang from this record a very suitable song for him Sleeping in the day, singing at night and accompanied her on guitar.
Otherwise, if he didn't sing, he played percussion, and all three singers were accompanied by a band composed of keyboards, cello, guitar, and double bass.
All three singers sang a little bit of the chorus of "To the Side of the Heart", which immediately spread the stage.
"I'm glad you were interested in the song, which didn't surprise me in Kmochov town", Michal Horáček responded.
After Peter Hapk's memoir, I Recognize in a performance by Francis Segrad, in the original by Richard Mueller, rewarded with a huge applause, Hannah Heger's song "Daddy liked Lid Baar" was again reminiscent of the song "Horáčkov explained the Communist ban and the replacement of Baar by American actress Mae West".
The composer Michael Kocába was again reminded of the song Sebastian, then Segrado sang the beautiful song Prague, sung by Yarda Svoboda, a flagship native and former Cologne.
But that was the end, the standing ovation and the appendix in the form of the optimistic song We Live in Wonderful Times.
Another addition was in the works for the playlist, but the fans didn't applaud it.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole quartet sat down to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also an older CD, Michal Horáček's book and even the cover of the legendary LP and with potential interested parties took a photo.
The Berdysh with the Stepanka will be joined by Rosol and Hajek
In the Davis Cup final against Serbia, the non-playing captain of the Czech tennis team, Jaroslav Bavartil, nominated Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czech representatives defend the trophy, but they go to play on the opponent's field in the Belgrade arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from November 15 to 17.
It's the third time the Czechs have made the final in five years.
"We know we're going to hit the hot ground, it's going to be wild, and we need to focus on our performance as usual".
"We're going there with one goal - to get three points and sell the best", said Stepanek, the winning goalkeeper in last year's final against Spain.
Secret wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training Obama on how to bomb Syria.
U.S. command in Libya.
Top Gun in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis have shown exactly what a bombing of Syria is supposed to look like.
Without any unnecessary hype, threats and millions of statements, the planes were sent, they hit the target and returned.
Without being embarrassed by the official elimination of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the entire action and they're not speaking out anymore.
The exact opposite of the confused and grossly unsupported actions of Obama's Syrian policy.
And the most satisfying of all the attacks was what the Israelis bombed.
Don't be fooled by the media's claims that "Syrian bases" or "supplies for Hezbollah" were bombed.
I recently wrote here that while the US's aid to secular insurgents in the country remains rhetorical, Russia is happy to continue to supply weapons to Syria.
And it was a fresh shipment of Russian missiles landed in the port of Latakia that became the target of an Israeli attack.
That's a clear message.
And notice, Israel is again bombing the Assad regime, not the insurgents, although popular Internet theories say it should be the other way around.
The U.S. government has identified two members of the space force, most likely Delta Force.
Until now, it was unknown that they had been identified during the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi.
The heroic deaths of two former SEALs who defended the CIA compound in the city are known, and I believe they were members of the CIA's secret command, which is made up of former soldiers.
There's been speculation for a long time about what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even at another CIA residence.
It's clearer now.
However, the information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected by machine gun nests (on one such one, both SEALs were killed by a minefield strike) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about those two hitherto unknown heroes.
They were part of the US command in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the news of the Benghazi attack, they volunteered to intervene and, along with five private contractors, they opened fire on the CIA compound in Benghazi.
The Obama administration is blamed for the fact that during that attack, the command was not officially deployed and fully deployed and they were just hesitating about what to do.
The commander-in-chief, without orders, will probably release these volunteers.
Anyway, the fact that the country is not a one-time operation, but a permanent U.S. command, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting information.
And that's because until recently, there was no official recognition of this, and even now, we're talking about some sort of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it's good that the United States is halfway there trying to fight terrorism in Libya.
Although it would take much more help to resolve the nationwide situation.
The last place of secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
Not so long ago, the media almost praised the Iranian air force for chasing down American drones.
However, little is known about the effectiveness of American drone protection.
Of course, if he happens to find his drone in airspace, there's nothing to do about it.
But if the Iranian drone is discovered in international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom was chasing an American drone in international space over the sea, possibly the first sharp deployment of the American F-22 Raptor super fighter in history.
He was flying Phantom to optically verify his weapon without the Phantom recording it on the radar or just noticing it, and then when he suddenly showed up at his house and called the Iranian pilot home, he listened without a whimper.
No wonder the Phantom is an American-made aircraft, but it's reminiscent of the Vietnam War.
He can't match the Raptor.
We want to show that the Sponge is still able to win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has not been able to achieve a good result recently, Viktoria Plzeň defender or defender František Rajtoral has a form that brought him back to the national team after a year.
He's good at shooting, he's good at activity, he was fined a penalty kick in the Teplices game.
Victoria scored in the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplice after the victory, but in the end she scored only one point from those two duels.
Francis Rytoral believes his team will break a rough series against Jablonski.
We want to show we can win.
"I believe we will defeat the apple at home", promises Francis Rytoral.
The men are preparing for a tough game against the North Czechs, who play offensive football.
Everything's headed for the Jablons, the coach is preparing us well, as always, we're getting a lot out of the video game selection of the opponent.
"I believe it will be a great match on Friday night", the Czech fan attracts the Doosan Arena.
The last few games didn't go as well as she'd like, but Victoria's defense denies the word crisis.
That's the way it is in football, sometimes you're in good shape and sometimes you're in worse shape.
But I would never talk about a crisis.
"I believe we'll win on Friday and it'll be good again", says the Western defender.
The men of Victoria will once again rely on the support of their fans.
"It's Friday night, and I'd like to invite our fans, who are great".
"I believe we will give them a win", Rajtoral adds.
- Step back, please.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step at all, but a big leap -- a leap back a few years, back to my memories, back to my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come out of school and wash dishes and get out and do homework.
Although these "obligations", they were mostly just theory, parents' wishes.
The practice was completely different - running out of school, throwing a bag in the corner, and running out.
Play ball games with other kids, jump a drink.
Then, on the show, Helena and her boys sew a wedding cloth for Grandma's birthday with chain stitches.
And then, after several times of warning, you can wash the dishes, flush them, apply wood to the bricks in the winter, and do homework under the lamp until dark (or rely on a classmate and write love poems to your school sweetheart instead of homework).
In the morning, we would eat homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not the jams that are sold now, whose contents were not even next to strawberries) and drink it with tea from dried herbs that my mother and I loved collecting.
I also remember those magical evenings when there was grave silence in the room, when my sister and I were recording songs from the radio on tapes that were played loudly on an old cassette tape of my mother's.
And then we were rolling the tapes over on the pencil and playing the same song over and over again, our favorite, and then we were drinking a siphon.
Or we used to make phone calls over a table using cans that were tied together by a cord - and when we were on the phone to hear each other better, we had to clean our ears thoroughly, the earring was a syringe plus a vat.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live off it so that we didn't need anything.
We didn't need any of those iPhones, iPads, even cell phones and laptops or branded clothes.
The clothing was passed down from generation to generation and the best "addition" to the wardrobe was a homemade, battered T-shirt made with SAVA.
We were satisfied with the electronics, including my mother's tape and, at most, the Walkman, which my sister and I shared and which we used on the train for our school trips.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Hop Hat or Man, don't get mad, or as I mentioned going "just" out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, which my parents certainly saved for a long time, but unfortunately it didn't last long.
My little sister put a stick in it, she said it was so beautifully popping the tapes, so she tried to see if the stick could work.
Unfortunately, he was asleep, but it was his last breath.
Well, that's the story he still has, poor thing, on his dad's plate.
She says that when Lenka was little, she put a stick in a video and thought she was playing the recipe and didn't play it, so she still can't bake it.
I remember how we all could communicate with each other, get along without a cell phone, a computer.
My sister and I agreed to meet again next summer at Grandma's house with the neighbor's granddaughter during the holidays, and that was it.
We were meeting.
Promise someone now that you'll see them in a year?
I also remember winter when the whole village and I ran out, built snowmobiles, rode on a snow-covered hill by the church on sleepy bags.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the day before.
Of course, before each meal, my sister and I would hear the famous line, "Run and wash your hands!"
Yeah, that's true today, but you certainly don't have a bathroom soap attached to a lemon net.
After dinner, when Dad was "working" at a beer in the garage with Yarda of the village, my mother and I lay on the floor, rubbed our feet against a brick, opened the door, looked at the flames, and listened to the cracking of wood coming out of the stone.
We were closer - really - not counting how many friends we had on social media, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated with each other -- we talked -- we didn't text each other every day through different chats, text messages.
There was nothing like that, and yet we knew so much more about each other.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It's a beautiful memory, especially when I'm adding to those memories by looking at the album, where black and white photos are tightly glued to the black horns.
And if I didn't know how old I was then, the back of the photo always says the year the photo was taken.
I see that while the pot cuts didn't really fit us and we had cousin's pants two digits bigger, no one had ever laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd rather go back to that step forward - to reality.
By 2013, and I'll be waiting for what the modern age will invent for my kids.
What I know for sure is that these memories of mine are now for the younger generation at least somewhere in the "hundred years behind the monkeys" and I think they're missing out a lot that they won't experience this "pre-Cop" time either.
I wish they could!
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued for Nortel's patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents for the defunct Nortel, filed a patent infringement suit on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers including Google, which it overcame in an auction in the bankruptcy of Nortel.
The Rockstar consortium, which purchased Nortel's patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies in the U.S. District Court in Texas for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps link internet search terms to relevant advertising, the lawsuit states, which is at the heart of Google's search business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which competes strongly with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a starting bid of $900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, and it's finally up to $4.4 billion.
After Nortel was defeated in a patent battle by Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal partially motivated by Motorola's patent pool.
Despite the failure to obtain the disputed patents at auction, Google infringed and continues to infringe the patents,the action is alleged.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google because it claims that Google's patent infringement is being committed intentionally, as the lawsuit claims.
Miloslava Cejpková: The smile of November
It came from outside, four degrees Celsius, which we're not used to.
First, she put off her smile, the one she always wore as a defense against a friendly environment.
It was a relief to her because it was a mask she chose not to wear in public.
He was only honest at home on the days when she was grandmother and had grandchildren, Elin or Adik.
And of course, when her sons called.
She remembered the lesson of endless business skills.
Now they're finally getting along.
So she won't grieve her closest.
Then he flew into the corner.
Like a disguise at the masquerade.
November, no other month can do the miracle of making her smile really like when they were on a trip with someone who hasn't been here for almost three years.
Egypt introduces the first freely elected president
Muhammad Morsi took the oath of office, but his triumphant day will hardly end the political unrest in Egypt.
Islamist Muhammad Morsi promised a new Egypt when he was inaugurated as the country's first freely elected president, after Husni Mubarak, who was deposed 16 months earlier.
When appointed to the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the monarchy was overthrown about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before 18 judges dressed in black plates in a mansion overlooking the Nile that reminds of an ancient Egyptian temple.
'We are striving for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,' Morsi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"The Egyptian people today laid the foundation for a new life, absolute freedom, true democracy and stability", said Morsi, a 60-year-old US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been under heavy governmental attack for most of its 84 years as an illegal organization.
When Morsi arrived in a small car column shortly after 11 a.m. local time, hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to celebrate the president, and unlike the presidential splendour of Mubarak's time, traffic was only briefly stopped so that the column could travel through the usually busy road connecting the city center with the suburbs to the south.
Mursi's personal prestige, derisively referred to as the uncharismatic "reserve tire" of the Muslim Brotherhood, has grown sharply since his victory and his Friday speech, which aimed to present him not only as a candidate of Islamists but also of all those who want to end the uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state", said Morsi, wearing a blue social suit with a red tie, to the judges in the wood-lined chamber where he took the oath.
Morsi later traveled to Cairo University, where he was to give the inaugural address.
While he was on guard, he received an official welcome from a military band playing the national anthem.
The military commander, Field Marshal Hussain Tantavi, was arrested.
His arrival was accompanied by the "Armada" chant and the people are a handful of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Cairo University was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later became a stronghold of the Islamic student movement in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took the symbolic oath in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and solemnly promised to seize back the presidential power taken from his office by a military council that took it from the deposed leader.
But by agreeing to take the oath of office before the court rather than the parliament, as is customary, he has submitted to the will of the army, suggesting that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic populist gestures.
I think there'll be police specialists in the ghettos to ease the tension.
In the future, police specialists should be working in the ghettos in the Czech Republic.
They'd spend up to half their commutes here.
They'd keep things in order and solve problems.
With their knowledge of the environment, they should help to reduce tensions between people in poor areas and those in the surrounding area.
The Ministry of Interior is counting on this in its proposal to reduce security risks.
He said that the main contribution to improving the situation in the country would be 'enhanced social housing provision'.
The government negotiated the document.
According to the analysis, a few years ago there were about 300 poor houses and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic.
There were 80,000 people living in them, mostly Roma.
Adults in the ghettos were unemployed, families were dependent on benefits, children were in "special" schools.
She was taking a bribe.
According to the problem sites, there's been a hundred more in the meantime.
The relationships between their inhabitants and others are intensifying.
Anti-Roman marches were held in several places.
People from the surrounding area joined the extremists.
Internally, it's hard for police to maintain security and order in ghetto areas.
The basic condition is that 'equal enforcement is consistently applied'.
But it's not possible to achieve that without a detailed knowledge of the place and the people.
A specialist would go on a ghetto walk where he would spend up to half his service, the rest in his district.
He'd be in trouble at the site.
He would also know the local area, so he could better handle problems or offenses.
"Thanks to the trust, specialists will be able to prevent a whole host of illegal acts more easily", the interior said.
Specialists in ghettos would get a bonus of 500 to 1,000 crowns a month.
The deployment of special police forces to troubled areas is to be financed from Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (now about 15,5 million crowns).
The Czech Republic pays 15% of the sum, the funds 85%.
The preparations started this year, and a detailed proposal is now being prepared.
The project is expected to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied for several years in Slovakia, where the problem of socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roma settlements here", the report's authors said.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer is to provide an analysis that will determine where a special agent would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release to these members each year after the project is completed.
According to the draft, the selected police officers will first be trained in Slovakia.
Five dozen members should be trained annually.
They'll be the most suitable candidates.
Special training should also be provided for police officers to operate in ghettos.
The authors say that social housing would help to improve the situation.
I'm told it should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the inside, it should have three categories.
The minimum standard would be accommodation with strictly defined rules such as the number of people per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard would be for social housing comparable to normal housing.
Tenants would have to follow an integration plan that social workers would draw up with them.
They should observe housing regulations, take care of their health, send their children to school, requalify themselves, and actively seek employment.
If they were to try to integrate, they would move up to a higher standard of housing.
The scheme should operate for at least 30 years, until the next generation is born in a 'pro-integration' environment.
The social housing model is prepared by resorts for local development and employment.
They're supposed to draft it by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: The Coal Mountain is one of our youngest volcanoes.
Coal Mountain is a prominent hill about two miles southeast of Bruntal.
Along with several others, evidence of volcanic activity in the Low Autumn region at a time (geologically) recent.
The last eruptions here were at the beginning of the Quadriers.
From a greater distance, the Baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of Help, built between 1755 and 1765, is visible in a white vault on top of the Coal Mountain.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The guest who was standing next to the church didn't stop.
Shortly after the church was completed, a four-lane lane was laid, about a mile long.
The Crusade on the Coal Mountain is the third version, the original one was built after 1916, the second one from 2001 lasted only until 2004.
There are 15 stops with wooden plastics made by the local art carpenter, Francis Nedomlel.
He used different types of wood from the Lower Autumn area.
Similarly, the rock basins of the area form an interesting geological exposition.
Each stop will have the sponsor's name.
The coal peak is the remnant of a young volcano.
Although the radiometric measurements vary slightly in age, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than the Great Red (aged 3.3 million years) and older than the Venus volcano (aged 0.8 million years).
The volcano was born by explosion.
It produced a significant amount of volcanic ash along with fragments of rock from the floor, which were burned to red-brown color.
At the end of this phase, it erupted on the surface of lava - today, it is a layer of pore-like sediment up to 13 meters [13 feet] high.
The second eruption produced red, brownish-red and black tuff spots.
Their layer is up to 50 meters high and part of it is accessible in the wall of the mine.
The tuffs feature spectacular volcanic peaks up to a meter high, and the second eruption was ended by a lava eruption.
To conclude the activity, lava erupted from the volcano, which today forms a powerful layer of crushed limestone up to 50 m high.
Volcanoes that alternate with lava eruptions are the most common type of volcano.
Because they're actually made of layers, they're called stratovolcanoes.
The original volcanic cone was gradually eroded.
But he was threatened by mining in the southern part of the mine.
The most intensive mining took place here between 1953 and 1962.
Tuffs were added to concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
Under pressure from experts and the public, the mining was stopped and this unique site was preserved.
The problem is the porosity and small cohesion of the rocks, which wind up quickly, break down and descend down the slope.
The looms are going away pretty quickly.
To make matters even more complicated, the warm, southern slope is an ideal location for some rare species of plants and animals.
The correction is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles are maintained at a number of important sites.
You'll get to the Coal Mountain by the green tourist sign from Bruntal, or Slezsk Kočov.
Drivers can use unpaid parking at the beginning of the lane where the short learning path begins.
She moved from the villa to the boarding house.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a cottage with a garden and a swimming pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villas in the Ořechovce district.
However, the original owners of the house recovered it in restitution and the tenants had to move away with a small allowance.
So Ivana quickly sought a new home for herself and her then-elderly mother.
She got a tip from friends for an apartment 3 + kk in an older boarding house on the other side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor of the vast forest park and dam across the road excited me", recalls Ivan.
At first, I thought it would be a temporary stay of about three years.
"We have lived here for more than 13 years now, and not only would I not change it for the sake of gradual reconstruction", adds the owner.
The mother and daughter were moving from a 100-foot [60 m] barn to a smaller one with a total area of 62 square feet and distributing nearly all the equipment.
The action was not easy, the items were stored with friends, and the gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but necessary repairs had to be made, such as painting the door or changing the windows.
The previous owner tore the core, but the owner was most affected by the unprocessed and unnecessarily large front, and the small bathroom.
The two rooms were combined to create a multifunctional living space.
Architects used a silk carton to define the zones and divide the room, which allowed new lighting.
The first thing she decided to do after a few years was remove the hook in the living room.
The apartment was changed to 2 + kk, but the room was airy and opened up to a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step towards partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of PVC flooring with laminate flooring.
Ivan couldn't get a bathroom.
I spent years picking up housing magazines and looking for inspiration.
I recently discovered an interesting realization in one of them.
So I approached the young architect Kamil Dudgerova for advice.
"It was actually the most important step forward", says Ivan.
The bathroom was also remodeled to accommodate the front.
The architect connected the toilet and bathroom space and replaced the two doors with open wings with one sliding, saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also barrier-free enough.
The quality covers mimic the sandbox, and the shower has a comfortable seat, and the bathroom has a bidet shower.
The successful cooperation with Kamilla Dudderova continued.
In the program How to build a dream, a rapid but fundamental transformation of the living room took place, in which the architect Martin Čeněk also participated.
In the space that was created by connecting two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping, without using the classic principles of optical division, like semiconductors or Japanese walls.
"This would result in a breach of the openness and uniformity of the space", explains the architect.
It was originally possible to separate the bedroom and living room.
All you had to do was turn two sofas back and forth and put a custom-made plush box between them.
The dining area is defined by the shades of the floor and the paintings.
On the floor in the kitchen and dining room, the architect used high-quality marmoleum, bringing the sliding door to life with a patterned wallpaper.
The kitchen corner shall be covered by wallpaper sliding panels if necessary.
The new anti-allergic marble flooring has a number of advantages over the laminate flooring: a softer, slippery, non-coupled surface and better sound insulation.
The system of strips and panels from the cardboard underlined by the colour is an example of how to work with space in a panel.
I left the paint on the architects, wishing it was fun.
"I like orange, the same shade I had in my previous apartment", says Ivan.
The graphoscopic coating with a flowering magnolia motif is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To the warm, energetic tone, the architects chose white, which emphasized modern functional style.
Among other things, the small apartment was able to store books in the space under the window frames.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably remotely controlled.
The new interior is in contrast to the older, with decades-old glass mirrors and the fine art that Ivan has collected throughout his life.
The kitchen came last.
The cabinets were previously placed on both sides and the owner felt a little like a tunnel.
The architect took their numbers and moved the layout.
The simple design of the furniture is custom made, the white surface slightly shades the pearly surface.
They were able to fit into a small space thanks to the imaginative solution of the washing machine, dryer and washing machine.
The small kitchen's appearance brought the full-glass wall cover over the workboard to life.
A unique digital-printed graphics case is attractive and well maintained.
Ivana picked magnolia flowers that remind her of her favorite neighborhood where she lived for the summers.
Now she seems happy here too.
The original bathroom had a small tub and sink, and the new owner chose a neutral shade of the enclosure.
The big shower corner has a glass door Ronal.
The task was to create a clear, simple space from the environment in which functions and devices would be in harmony.
We've united the interior in material and color and tried to make it look elegant, cozy, not overcrowded.
"Another condition for the assignment was a barrier-free solution with minimal obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and the accessibility of everyday items", adds Kamila Douděrová.
The Supreme Court has ruled that there is no time to sue.
The Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Peter Necase can be prosecuted for any crimes he may have committed before the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies in August.
He was protected only by the procedural immunity that applies to speeches in the House.
In the case of former ODS MPs Ivan Fuksy, Mark Snyder and Peter Tluchoře, however, it decided that they could not be punished for any crimes until they had relinquished their parliamentary mandate last November, said Supreme Court spokesman Petr Knötig.
In that decision, the Court rejected the request of Prosecutor Iva Istvan to continue the criminal proceedings with the Member.
He said they've accepted bribes in the form of lucrative jobs in state-owned companies for giving up their mandate and not having trouble passing laws.
On the contrary, the former prime minister who offered them these posts can be prosecuted further.
He and Vit Bart were also detained by the anti-corruption police.
Mr Oldrich Podabo, Barth's lawyer, who also represented him in the alleged corruption of MPs, also declined to comment too much on the case, but said: "Yes, I represent the client in this case too, but given the protection of classified facts, I cannot comment further".
According to the information, the case is being handled by the General Inspectorate of Security Corps (GIBS).
The server said Bartha may have been buying classified information from the police.
According to the server, the case may have been related to the case of former police chief Peter Lessy, whose appointment to the position of Bart he allegedly sought.
But the latest information from the lawsuit shows that the detention of Vito Barta is not related to Peter Lessy.
Police chief Eva Kropáč refused to comment on the case, saying the Prague city council was handling the case.
"We will not comment on this question in any way, in the light of the protection of classified facts", said on Friday the Prague City Prosecutor's Office spokeswoman.
It is the applicant there who is overseeing the case of Bart, and it follows indirectly from her words that the case or criminal proceedings are being conducted in secret.
Novinek reporter managed to reach the wife of Vit Bart Katerina Klasna this morning outside their home in the Prague city of Klarov.
She was just packing up her car and leaving.
She declined to comment on the incident.
On Friday morning, the leader of the Dawn movement, Tomio Okamura, spoke out against Bart's arrest.
He says he has no idea what the case is about.
"With Bart was one of many candidates from many parties on our candidate, and as I have said repeatedly before the election, he was not and is not a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy, Tomia Okamura", he added.
Barta, who unsuccessfully ran for the House of Representatives in the Plzeň region in the last early elections for Tomia Okamura's Dawn of Direct Democracy, is known for his corrupt charge of public affairs MPs.
In April 2012, he was wrongfully sentenced to 18 months with a 30-month suspended sentence.
The sentence was later overturned and Barta was acquitted.
I want an NHL contract.
I still have the desire, the desire and the excitement
For her sleep, family has always been the first priority, so at 38, she wants to be fully submissive to her.
Either he gets a job overseas and extends his career, or he's definitely out of hockey.
"I want to be a father and a husband".
"I look forward to it", says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for an offer.
Despite being a prominent worker who never sleeps.
Even though he always leaves his heart on the ice and can tear his teammates apart.
And also despite the fact that he was Columbus' most productive player last season.
"But the desire to show everyone is still in me", she declares determinedly.
He might be able to get through, reportedly the New York Rangers, who missed the season and have two injured rear-end picks, striker Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
How's your arrival at the Rangers looking?
It's all speculation.
Until I have something on paper, there's no point in dealing with it.
I know there's an article in the New York Post that says I should be signed, but that's it.
Nowhere else has it been reported that this has ever happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it's just not.
You haven't even gotten a call from the club?
That's the kind of communication that happens in the NHL every day.
That's where you get to get into a situation where the contract really comes.
When a player gets hurt or someone can't do it and the mancha doesn't fall.
There's a lot of different factors that have to come together to get this contract.
But New York has a similar situation, right?
Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan are injured and the team didn't make the season, so there's a chance, don't you think?
Of course, there's always a chance.
But the second thing is, you always need two sides to do it.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't got one yet.
Unfortunately, this is the reality I have to live in.
You're flying to America on Friday, you expecting something to work out?
I've had those expectations since July 5th, when the NHL free-throw market opened, and still nothing.
You're going to New York to remember?
No, I'm going to Tampa to get the kids and the wife.
I'm looking forward to the sunshine and seeing you again.
Do you have a schedule?
It's because I'm a father and a husband, and that's what it's all about.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm gonna be a father and a husband, and I'm really looking forward to it.
Your son has two hockey games on Sunday, so it's a holiday for me and my whole family when we can go out and support our kids in whatever they want to do.
You think you could do this on a full-time importation job?
Sure, you can think about a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago, missing 50 games for knee surgery.
And I had a lot of fun.
One day, it'll get to a point where all the goals, all the wins and all the games won't replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
You can have the job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing I could ever do apart from my family.
You've had a lot of offers from Europe: do you have it so you want to play the NHL just because it's the NHL, or is it for your family that you want to be in America?
As a hockey player, sporting success comes first, besides family.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life is all about.
My kids, so excuse me, our kids -- my kids and my wives -- grew up in the States, started going to school there, and so on.
And we would love to see them continue this trend.
Because as we're gonna say, there are possibilities in America somewhere else.
We should give them that chance.
So you're planning on staying in America permanently?
We'll practice as we've been doing.
That means we'll be in the Czech Republic in the summer on the Deep and around the Czech Budovice.
And in winter, we'll be back in Tampa or where our steps lead us.
It's perfectly ideal to be warm all the time.
I've been very lucky in my life.
I guess I went to meet him, it took a lot of strength and a lot of renouncing, and it took away a lot of things I missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where we live.
There are many people in the world who long for this so that they can choose what they do and how they live.
How long will you be willing to work hard at your age, train hard, and wait for an offer?
Yeah, well, that's a question I can't answer.
I still have that juice, that passion, that passion, that passion for the sport, that desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have the NHL, that I'm always better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it'll stay there.
There's no way to plan this.
So you're gonna wait until this season, see how it goes, and then decide what to do next?
I'm in a phase where I go day in and day out.
The Commission has also concluded that the Commission is not in a position to take any further action to prevent the spread of the virus.
He justified this by waiting for the new State Energy Concept and the approval of the Contracts of Difference by the government.
For these reasons, the current management of the CZE is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - the majority shareholder.
A qualified manager should give his shareholders a recommendation, not hide behind him.
I only rule with Saturday.
Andrej Babiš is starting to feel that his ANO movement will not have time to learn the political craft of the opposition and that it will have to go directly to the government to form one.
The president of the ANO admitted that in the Law Interview, which is coming out tomorrow.
Business and marketing of ŠkoFIN is led by Ibrahimek
Its competence includes product and marketing and enhancing cooperation with business partners.
He replaced the maniac Shantor.
Ibrahimek has spent the last 14 years of his professional career in the automotive industry.
He worked at Toyota Motor Czech, then Fiat ČR, where he was responsible for Alfa Romeo brand and dealers for seven years.
His last employer was Suzuki Motor Czech, where he was manager of the automotive division for over five years.
ŠkoFIN was established in 1992.
Police evacuated a portion of Los Angeles airport due to gunfire.
There was a shooting at the Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
Police evacuated a portion of the airport, which was reportedly Terminal 3.
Reuters, citing California media, claims law enforcement fired a rifle on a gunman.
The Los Angeles Times reported to the police that there was a shooting that injured two to three traffic safety officers.
How many people were injured overall and whether there were any casualties is still unclear.
Firefighters are talking about an incident with more casualties.
CNN: Israel has bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was supposed to be Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli military aircraft reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
With an appeal to an unnamed U.S. government official, CNN reported.
The Israeli press has reported extensively on the explosion at the alleged missile depot, but the Israeli government has not confirmed the attack.
An Israeli military spokeswoman declined to comment on the raid.
"We're not commenting on foreign media reports", she said.
According to a US government source, the Israeli attack targeted rockets and related equipment that the Israelis believe could be transported to the Lebanese militant Hezbollah movement.
The AP, citing another US security official, reported that the Israeli strike on Syrian territory was targeted by Russian SA-125 missiles.
Israeli TV's second channel reported that the target was reportedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the area of attack, however, DPA said showed a battery of Russian S-125 Neva missiles.
In addition, they were said to have seen SA-3 missile batteries, including a command center with radar to track the missiles and their targets.
According to Israeli television, the missiles have a range of 35 kilometers and can carry a 70-kilogram warhead.
Israel has reportedly bombed rocket shipments inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and AP reported.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly stated that it will intervene in any supply of weapons targeting Hezbollah or other terrorist groups.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre appears to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit estimate and expects record profits from recreationists in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its pre-tax annual base profit to be between USD 325 million and USD 340 million, compared to USD 305 million to USD 315 million from the previous forecast.
If current trends are maintained, this will represent an increase of 12 to 17 per cent from the record profit of USD 290,4 million in 2011/12.
Chief Executive Graham Turner said Flight Centre made a profit of 8% in the first half and the second half started to see rapid growth, particularly in Australian and UK non-business travel.
"As of today, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading for record annual profits before interest and tax", he said.
This includes Australia and the UK, which are traditionally our biggest producers of profit.
Recreational businesses have been recovering in Australia during the second half of the year, compensating for the slightly weaker domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre performed well in the leisure sector, while corporate clients spent less.
US trade has recovered from losses during the seasonally weaker half and is expected to bring in a third consecutive year-round profit.
Flight Centre's stock was up 3 cents on the $38.20 mark yesterday.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia have been transferred to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained since September in Russia for protesting against planned oil drilling in the Arctic have been transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
This was reported by AFP today, citing the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
It also claims that the original charges against its activists for piracy have not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women detained in Russia after a nonviolent operation against the Arctic oil field have been transported from a correctional facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg", the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of the activists detained are unclear; according to the DPA, the relocation was planned.
Environmental authorities initially charged them with piracy, which could carry up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
But last week they announced they would replace the charge with a lesser amount of perversion, which carries a lower sentence of up to seven years in prison.
But Greenpeace today's statement warned that the authorities have not yet withdrawn the piracy charges as promised.
That means the detainees are now charged with two felonies.
The powerful Commission of Inquiry announced last week that it would replace the charges of piracy with those of rioting.
But when 30 prisoners appeared before the committee this week, the piracy charges were not dropped.
Instead, new charges were brought against everyone", Greenpeace quoted AFP as saying.
The Russians detained three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries at the Gazprom oil field in mid-September.
The environmentalists were on the ship Arctic Sunrise, which was flying the Dutch flag.
Ever since, they've all been held in custody, which they appealed against, but the court dismissed all of them.
The environmentalist is complaining about the conditions of imprisonment.
Greenpeace Executive Director Kumi Naidoo told AFP today that the move to St. Petersburg would facilitate the meetings of detainees with families and consular staff.
But there is no guarantee that conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they can be worse", he warned.
One of the detained activists, Faiza Oulahsen, asked for help from King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, she asked the monarch to discuss their situation at a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He claims that Maliki has a large role in reviving sectarian violence in Iraq, which is also partly a result of fighting in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on math, spelling and grammar
In English literature classes, you'll have to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British fairy tales from 1914 onwards.
The test will also include a hidden text to motivate further reading;
Combined English literature and language courses will be cancelled.
From 2015 onwards, students will be required to take a language qualification exam and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an elective subject.
The Ministry of Education is due to issue a new curriculum for English and Mathematics tomorrow, the first subjects to undergo a radical change.
Other major subjects are expected to change next year.
In a separate step, Ofqual, which supervises the final examinations, will reveal changes to the final examination structure, together with a new grading system and a smaller volume of student projects.
In his speech this summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there was a broad consensus on whether we needed to reform our examination system to regain the trust of society and that we needed to insist on making the graduation exam more challenging, ambitious and rigorous.
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths  116 hours a year or three hours a week  than most other countries.
For comparison, schools in Australia spend an average of 143 hours a year in mathematics, and in Singapore, about 138.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to math, coalition sources have said that a comprehensive math graduation exam  along with greater emphasis on this subject in the scoreboard  will likely encourage schools to provide additional instruction.
The curriculum will focus more on real-world problems, including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Mayor Kajnar: Cancer in the USSR is not me
Before the election, a long-running dispute erupted between two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrov CZSSD.
It all culminated when the mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, went to court over the undemocratic selection of candidates.
The parties did not want to express themselves too much to further harm the party before the elections.
But now the votes of the electorate are counted.
The leadership of the Ostrov SSR called the mayor of Ostrov to step down on Monday night and will likely press for his resignation.
But Peter Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
What the dispute is about and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview for The Daily.
How do you feel about the election results?
The SSR certainly expected a much better outcome.
Did she feel bad about the media's handling of the party's internal disputes before the election?
I can imagine that a social democracy could have a better election result.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state of the CZSD now.
It's a party that has its own internal problems, is internally ill, and people perceive that everything is not right about it.
They made it clear in the election.
What are these internal diseases of the CSSD?
I think the SDS has been declining for some time now, and unfortunately, things like this are happening in social democracy.
It's just that lobbyists, influential people who previously expected their prebendaries to be found in the ODS, have moved to the people in the CFSP and have an influence on them.
That's because the police are going through the Ostrava County Courthouse and collecting computers.
This shows that the CSSD is not only made up of people who want the good of everyone else, but many of them think of their own good above all else.
The CSSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps in Prague, as seen in the current power struggle between the Hashkovs and the Sobotkovs.
But that was a long time coming.
What happened before the Ostrava elections was just a foreshadowing of what's happening now in Prague.
Hashk's wing gradually took up positions to create a situation after the election that would weaken Sobotk's wing.
A man in politics is in a situation where he sometimes has to compromise.
But everyone has an inner limit to when compromises don't work, and that's my case.
I didn't want to run for the House of Commons at first, but seeing the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Luboz Zaoralek that I would try to get a county candidate to strengthen Sobotk's wing as mayor of Ostrava.
But Hash's wing stopped it.
Why are you on the side of Goduslav Sabotka and not Michael Hash?
I think the Slavotka is a man who always talks about the USSR's program and, to some extent, about his vision for the party and for this country.
I must admit, I've never heard anything like that from the other side.
Michal Hashek is just fighting for power.
I don't understand how the presidency, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can just start recalling the party chairman.
It's a power struggle regardless of anything and against party rulings.
I think what Michal Hashek has just performed in Prague has ended his political career.
How did you feel about the fact that the Ostrov leadership of the USSR did not approve you as a candidate?
Political parties are based on a competition to find out who is the best member.
The competition should be based largely on program visions and the ability of those people to fulfill those visions.
Of course, there are people who do not have the skills or vision to enter the contest, but a political party is a raise for them to get money they would not get elsewhere.
The problem is, when these people start to get ahead because they're unscrupulously breaking the rules, breaking the party's statutes.
They're making political parties into the mafia by their practices, and I think they're breaking the laws of the Czech Republic.
To point out this problem is more important to me than to consider whether any Kajnar has any political future.
It's important that the parties start respecting the statutes.
So you submitted a motion to the court for interim measures against the applicant for the USSR in the Moravian-Silesian Region before the elections?
The current district executive committee of the CZSSD in Ostrava strengthens its power by being able to dissolve organizations that do not suit it, purposefully establish new organizations, and gradually expel uncomfortable party members.
An example is that they wanted to expel Richard Bednarik from the bar, but he sued and they overturned the decision.
This shows that while the last option is to demand compliance with the Party's statutes through the courts, it is the only option once the other methods and control authorities within the CFSP have ceased to function.
The Ostrov SSR leadership, led by MP Adam Rykal, is trying to remove you from the position of mayor.
It's a public secret that Mayor Lumir Palyz of Porubá is running for this position.
It's true, Adam Rykala and Lumir Palyza are trying to do everything they can to get me fired.
They promise people positions, they win votes, and then they use those votes to consolidate their power in the party.
If I go back in time, everything that happened around the Ostrava Cup and the purchase of the Basel stadium was just an excuse to attack me.
It was artificially staged so they could call me a person who puts money where it's not supposed to.
The city has bought property that is strategically valuable to it.
So how do you see it with your stay as a primate?
The district committee already invited me and others on Monday to consider staying in the USSR.
But I think it's like a thief shouting, "Catch the thief!"
Looking at the results of my work over the last 11 years, I don't see anyone in the Ostrava Social Democracy who would initiate and push, sometimes against party members, the creation of so many developmental things, like industrial zones or the expansion of a science and technology park.
I'm getting uncomfortable with everything.
I read it to prevent others from getting to the places they desire.
Will you fight any more against these efforts?
Because if this republic is to work well, political parties must work well.
I can hardly believe any party can effectively run a state if it can't run itself.
So I don't think I'd leave the CFSP now because I think the one causing the cancer on this side is not me, but these people trying to get rid of me.
The pencil opens a public slide in the historic center
Pavel Spálený, organiser of Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skiing, said that the preparatory work on the ski area had started on 26 October and that the ice production units had been in operation since Wednesday.
The ice sheet is now seven centimeters thick and the area will be ready for the first visitors by Friday morning.
The slide is 375 square meters, the stage took 358 square meters.
The two punch stands will also be available for the brushmen and passersby.
"We've expanded the floor area, expanded the area in front of the stands, and almost the entire floor area is covered so that the skiers can comfortably move around", Burnt described.
The streets of Olomouc are already reminiscent of the coming Christmas.
Last year, a slide was installed to repair Lower Square right outside the main entrance to Upper Square Town Hall.
The repair of Lower Square was completed at the end of the summer, so the ice surface could return to its original location.
The first time people could sneak in front of the city hall was in 2009, when the ski resort was in operation from January to March.
The ice floor then became an integral part of the city's Christmas markets.
The Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural programme, will open in Upper Square a month before Christmas Day.

The brutal murder of a senior in Zlínsk will be re-examined by the district court
The county court acquitted a 25-year-old Slovak and a 22-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men denied the guilt.
They face 15 to 20 years in prison or even an emergency sentence.
Peter Angyalossy, the High Court's spokesman, confirmed that the district court had reversed the decision and returned the case to the court.
The reasons for this refused to comment, stating that the decision had not yet been served on the parties.
The charges say the youths assaulted a 70-year-old man in his home.
Senior died a painful death.
The charges state that the men strangled, beat and kicked him all over the body and also put a metal object, apparently a gas pistol, into his head with about three dozen wounds.
The man suffered serious injuries, such as fractured skull, brain swelling, or brain bleeding that he fell to the ground.
The young men reportedly took about 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns from the house.
According to the district court, they were the only, and only indirect evidence against the accused, odor marks which the expert assessed as not fully detected within the meaning of the legal guidelines.
Although scented scent marks on the scene and other items were in more than a dozen cases consistent with those of the defendants, police initially treated them as if they were physical, not scented.
In addition, some errors were found in dealing with them.
The Senate has held that the defendants were not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
The dead senior with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he probably fell and injured himself.
The emergency services doctor called in didn't even notice the violent death.
The criminals were contacted by the O.M.D.s only days later, who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
Police could no longer work with all the crime scene tracks that the relatives cleaned up.
No DNA from the defendants was found at the scene.
A young Slovak lived in the Hungarian Garden.
He is now serving an 8.5 year sentence, which was upheld last year by the Olomouc Supreme Court.
He claims he was the head of an organized group of six young men who are accused of robbing gold.
The robberies took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slopn.
The youngest of the defendants in the murder of a senior lives in the Hungarian Castle.
The court released him in August after 11 months in custody.
Znojma starts with the reconstruction of the stadium
The reconstruction of the football stadium in Znojmo will begin in early November.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by the builders who are going to rebuild the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojma is divided into four stages to meet the standards of the first football league.
The living legend Wayne Shorter will close next week the String of Autumn.
Saxophone giant and jazz legend Wayne Shorter will be making his debut next Wednesday at the 18th annual String of Autumn Festival.
Shorter will perform on November 6 at the Grand Hall of Lucerne with his quartet of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
At 2:30 p.m. the spontaneous improvisation of the PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the direction of Martin Kumžák will join Shorter.
In the short arrangements for symphony orchestra, Pegasus will perform a song from the new album Without A Net, as well as his older songs Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August, Shorter is still alive, proving that the Prague concert at the Struna Autumn will kick off his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the music world more than 60 years ago.
The list of performers he's worked with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
Along the way, he also met Czech musician Miroslav Vitusz and Viennese-born Joe Zawinule, with whom he set the direction for a new fusion style in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade.
For the past 13 years, he has performed with the Wayne Shorter Quartet.
Like the afterparty after the festival, there's the Spotlight night club, which will be held on November 9 at the Roxy/NoD club.
Alongside charismatic singer Andrey Triana, the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin will introduce to the local audience their jazz-influenced electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikysk, who will bring the electro-jazz band Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
Damko is said to be prohibiting UEFA from publishing arbitration penalties.
Dagmar Damková, chairman of the Czech Football Association's arbitration committee, has stopped publishing judges' sentences.
UEFA rules prohibit her from doing so, she said in an interview with the law.
Otherwise, they say the FACE could be hit.
Damková also refused to host the football players of her native Plzen.
These speculations are really pointless.
It's true that I live in Plzeň, but the other members of the commission are from elsewhere, like Prague.
So in the case of the vote, I can lose 1: 6", Damková said in response to criticism that erupted after Plzeň had recently played twice as many penalty games as other league teams.
Although the FAFR has stopped publishing penalties for arbitrators in recent months, Damková assures that judges are blaming themselves for their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the commission finds out that the referee made a mistake, they will limit his delegation, whatever the match", Damková said.
The reason the penalties are not published is because of a ban by the European Football Union, according to Damma.
"UEFA prohibits the publication of such information and severely punishes infringements".
"We're very suspicious and we look for something in every mistake".
"We have published the restrictions, but I have received two very strong warnings that if we do not stop, there will be tough sanctions", Damková said.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really the exception", she added.
If the information were to continue to be published, the Commission could lose money from UEFA to train and develop referees.
"And they're very important to us".
"Without them, we could not complete the referee training program", Damková added.
Bart's detention is related to Janusz and Bema.
The president of the Public Works Department, Bert, was arrested by the police on Thursday.
He was also detained along with Jan Petržilek, head of the department of analytics and computer science of the anti-corruption police.
The detention is related to the interviews with lobbyist Roman Janouš and former Mayor Pavel Bema (ODS).
The information on the wiretapping provided by the server Novinky.cz was confirmed by a reliable source to the Czech Press Office.
The phone calls between Janush and Bema, which were published in March last year by the newspaper Mladá fronta Today, in which the two men address each other as "Mazánka" and "Kolibřík", show Janush's influence on the city's movements under Bema's leadership.
The newspaper then stated that they had been acquired by the Security Information Service (BIS) in 2007, from which they leaked to the security agency ABL two years later.
He owned Bart's back then.
The server Novinky.cz has warned that the detained criminal Petržílek worked for the BIS before joining the anti-corruption police.
The anti-corruption unit, which subsequently dealt with the hearings, Petržílek moved in at the same time as they were published.
"In view of the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm or say anything at all", said Prosecutor Michal Muravský of the Prague Municipal Prosecutor's Office.
He refused to confirm that he was overseeing the case.
The case is not being commented on by the inspectorate for the same reason.
Six companies out of 10 are preparing for a new civil code
Six out of 10 companies are intensively preparing for the coming into force of the new Civil Code and the Trade Corporations Act from 1 January 2014.
Only 8% of the company representatives surveyed said that they had not solved any issues related to both key codes in their company.
This is according to a survey by the law firm Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which examined the views of 108 Czech firms.
In the face of the impending expiry of both key codes, it is only now that a number of managers are beginning to realize the significant impact they can have on their companies' business.
The biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years, we believe, will affect all citizens and businesses in the Czech Republic.
The politicians' laundering has long left the business world uncertain whether or not revolutionary change will eventually occur.
"But now they have only a few weeks to go before the transition to the new law is easy for their companies", commented Jan Spanchal, partner of Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
Of the 61 percent of companies that are intensively engaged in new legislation, 26 percent said that their companies have already taken all necessary steps to be ready in time.
Furthermore, 35% of these companies plan to take the necessary measures in the near future.
By contrast, one in five companies that have not yet done any work on recoding have a concrete idea of how to prepare for it.
A total of 11 percent have no opinion and cannot assess the issue.
Only 8% of companies admit that they have not yet resolved recoding issues.
The most important legal issues related to the new Civil Code are the conclusion of new contracts (21 percent), the settlement of business conditions (16 percent) and changes in property and liability for damages (10 percent) for the largest number of companies surveyed.
In the case of contracts, one of the most important developments in the whole of recodification is the unification of the Treaty provisions only under the new Civil Code.
The current parallel legislation in the Civil and Commercial Code will disappear, making contract law more transparent for citizens and businessmen.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new arrangement will offer many new features with an emphasis on greater freedom to arrange relationships", said Lukas Poddaný, lawyer at Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
In the context of the Trade Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the accountability of statutory authorities to be the most important issue.
The following are the issues concerning changes in the convocation and course of the General Meeting (15%) and the representation of the company (14%).
The new legislation implies a tightening of obligations and possible implications for statutory authorities, especially when companies are in danger of bankruptcy or fall into it.
'In practice, this means that unless the members of the board and the company executives deal with the care of the proper manager and avoid the company's impending bankruptcy, they may lose the benefits gained from the performance of their duties only in the last two years,' Spakolil added.
I'm trying to develop Cartier's style as a living language.
My job is to preserve tradition and at the same time lead our brand to modern things so that it doesn't become a deserted relic, Pierre Rainero, director of style at Cartier, explains in an interview with HN.
This French luxury house dates back to 1847.
He travels through mud, rivers and jungles, providing free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not many doctors in West Africa; only one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 nominees for the 2013 CNN Hero of the Year award.
In the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year contest, you can vote for him or any of the top 10 nominees.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious over and over again and drive to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Cameroon's capital Yaounde in 1981.
At first, he was treated with only a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that spread to his brain and produced a hematoma that caused him problems all his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon", says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received the treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy", says Bwelle.
You can leave home at 5:00 in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since 2002, when Bwelle's father died, things haven't changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
Just for comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if doctors could visit Cameroonians, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of every five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of health care spending in this country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty", says Bwelle.
They can't enjoy life because of poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a vascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaound.
And he founded the nonprofit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he has helped nearly 32,000 people with his group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people rush into vans, attach to rooftops for medical supplies, and travel through rough terrain to villages in need.
Not always with happiness.
Sometimes vehicles have to push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they'll be greeted as true heroes: feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is truly a cause for celebration, and Bwelle  with her broad smile and unbridled energy  is very willing to join the local cheerleading.
The next day, the team starts treating hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on each trip", Bwelle says.
They come to the village from a 60-kilometer loop, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide a variety of medical care.
Many are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get crutches or donated glasses or a birth certificate for free  a document that the school requires but many impoverished families simply cannot afford.
Tonight, the team is doing a simple operation under local anesthesia.
Surgeries are usually performed in a school building, a town hall, or at home; after the operation, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to make room for another patient.
Using the lights from the generator, operating room and hygiene equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning.
It's exhausting, but the village musicians usually help the band keep it motivated.
"To stay awake and keep working, they're playing drums all night", says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will head back to town, tired but proud of their work.
This group of  Cameroonian doctors and international medical students  performed 700 free surgeries last year and realize that their help can mean a lot to the local population.
One man said that after the operation, the hernia will be able to work again.
"It will change the future of our family", said the man.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and the surgeon's work at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private health clinics around Yaounde City.
He says that this second work is responsible for about 60 percent of his nonprofit activities; the rest is funded by private contributions.
"I'm not sure when she actually sleeps", says Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia who works as a volunteer for Bwelle's group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization to do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it's a great practice they wouldn't have at home.
"We washed Dr. Bwelllem's hands thoroughly and removed blood stains or held his tools", says O'Malley.
You'll never experience that as a sophomore in medicine in America.
Students who volunteer usually pay for their own trip to Cameroon and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But once they arrive in Yaound, Bwelle provides them with food, transportation and study.
"He is a hero, no doubt", says O'Malley.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, constant struggles are no burden.
Helping others live happier lives, fulfilling a promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy doing this job", says Bwelle.
And I think about my father.
I hope they see what I'm doing.
To make people laugh, to ease their pain, that's why I do it.
Take a look at the ASCOVIME website and find out how you can help.
Holcát Minister resumed the role of Chief Nurses for the Czech Republic
The Czech Chief Nurse should represent the interests of nurses, whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100 thousand.
"I consider it essential that these functions are clearly defined and formalized, that nurses have their representatives within the structure of the Office - representatives to whom they can always turn if necessary", explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of nurses, and I think the nursing profession deserves the proper attention of the ministry.
The profession requires not only high professional professionalism but also a human approach and personal conviction.
"I will gladly and responsibly endeavour to promote the steps that can improve the position of nurses".
"We have excellent and skilled nurses in our healthcare sector, but I would like to appeal to colleagues who do not help us much with their approach to patients to exercise their vocation with empathy and help us improve the image of nurses in the public eye", says Alena Schmidt.
On the occasion of her appointment, the newly appointed Head Nurse of the Czech Republic, Alena Šmidová, also stated that she wanted to address various aspects of the nurse's job position and that she intended to work with, among others, professional associations, professional societies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"I don't want to separate the medical profession from the nursing profession, but I see them standing side by side, each with their own competencies, and together with other health professionals, forming a team of professionals who provide health services to the patient".
"I personally encounter a number of problems in the nursing profession, and I recognize these difficulties and intend to help solve them".
This includes, for example, ensuring simplification of nursing and health documentation.
"I know from personal experience that some administrative tasks are unnecessarily burdensome and take up time for nurses, which they should and should rather spend on patients", says Alena Schmidt.
Other areas to be addressed include improving working conditions, finding ways to improve team and healthcare provider management cooperation, competence management and labour law issues such as compliance with the labour code or not burdening the nurses with insufficient numbers at a given time and place.
We often hear anonymous whistles, but for fear of possible repercussions, they are not documented in a specific case where a breach of the rules could occur.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, and the role of Chief Nurse of the Czech Republic could in this case serve as a guarantee of anonymity of such a complaint and to let the specific case be investigated by the competent authorities", concludes Alena Šmidová.
Ms. Alena Šmidová graduated from the Central Medical School in the field of Nurse (graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of the Charles University in Prague in the study programme Nursing - Pedagogy (graduated in 1992).
Since 2010, he has been Head of the Nursing and other non-medical and qualification recognition department of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Czech Republic.
During her professional career she worked as a bed nurse in the internal department, and as a teacher at the Central Medical School, where she was also the statutory deputy principal for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she was the Chief Nurse of the Czech Prisons Service.
She has published several professional nursing textbooks and articles in professional journals, and has lectured in the field of nursing.
She's not a member of any political party.
♪ So I won't get so full of hate ♪
The writer Vaclav Kahuda returned to writing after 12 years.
After many years of reading, living, but not writing, VACLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes his novel The Wind, the Darkness, the Presence.
The number of pages is comparable to that of his most famous work, Hushtin (Petrov, 2001).
Another prominent Czech writer of the present day, Emil Hakl, confessed to Salon Kahudu.
What moved you to write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it - to avoid getting drunk with hate.
To see all around us new and new clones of human folly, young organisms affected by blind selfish endeavors.
I'm not even talking about the elderly, faces ruined by helpless greed, ecclesiastical souls and opposite polarised ideologues trying to sell their "product" with the expression of little sales whores.
At the turn of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and I filmed my jovial friends, weirdos and secret services.
I'm through with it.
Sometimes I feel like my brain is burning from living on this planet.
I like to go for walks and then read a book at the lighthouse in the evening.
You're talking about a feeling of anger, of hatred.
Was there a flaw in the past that affected you, or are you just getting old like the rest of us?
The break occurred a long time ago, about ten years ago.
It didn't have a name back then.
Well, I lived after that.
But there's still a surprised, quiet boy in there.
I see more lonely gymnasts, each in their tornado of anxiety.
Writing books saved me.
I'm part of the enormous, thousands-year-old movement of the life system on this planet -- the birth of an unfathomable future.
The immense, breath-taking complexity of life, where every stone is the direct heir to our presence.
We are players of sad and beautiful games where, in the process of trial and error, we create a generation after generation of beings who, in billions of interactions per second, create some superhuman, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as a continuous process, or did you start from scratch?
Self-talk, or better, dialogue, conducted by the right and left hemispheres of the brain, sometimes floats to the surface and is formulated into a book.
As peace periods are quietly marked by sleeping metastases of wars that may one day awaken, so my book is twelve years of silence clothed in words.
I felt the silent avalanche of life growing in my brain, and if I didn't do anything, one day it would quietly overwhelm me.
It's a set of questions that the brain has formulated and placed in layers that are stored in the dark "below the level of consciousness".
The neocortex, the gray cortex of the brain, is asking for older evolutionary structures, going to the ancient brain tree.
He speaks to furry beasts, he asks snakes, he searches for answers in the flight of birds, he looks up at the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law within me and the starry sky above me.
Finally, the brain asks the world.
You're a relatively frequent metaphor for ego - could you define it biologically?
The brain stores in its billions of connections and electrochemical connections all the memories, experiences, and experiences that the individual has experienced.
This forest of logically and emotionally exposed and branching information trees, memory registers, uses the brain in its cognitive, cognitive, process, is exposed to constantly changing presence, in an unremitting effort to name and understand its environment and decode important messages.
Sometimes there are overload disorders.
Similarly, if you were to "fall" from a PC, you would get stuck in an operating environment, like Windows, with a language emulator and a foreign language translator, and after a few unsuccessful restarts, you would end up on a dark green, flashing Bios screen, in the basic system that controls the functions and collaboration on the motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory, etc.
For those of you who haven't figured out what this is, I'm talking about a psycho-spiritual crisis.
You mention it often - why are you so interested in this type of regression?
Because it's a hole.
In the history of the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling, and behavior, a breakthrough will occur.
Here's a good quote from Nietzsche: "He looked into the abyss for so long that the abyss looked into him".
It creates a feeling of being lost when all hope is gone, mentally "dead" and a new quality comes along.
And why do I care about that personally?
I'll give you a metaphor.
Once one fell into a pit and drowned, days, months, and years passed, he kept drowning while reading, and those books taught him to swim - to live.
He became a "diver".
I hope some of my own writing helps, as the Count's texts helped me.
How much do you think of the reader, the specific person who will read your text?
The one that you can't tell anything meaningful about, some call it consciousness, another super ego, but I think Arthur Rimbaud best described it in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else - this reader is directly involved in the wording process".
From an early age, he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in Captain Nem's submarine, ran the Shadows in dark alleys.
And finally, behind all the branching of the authors and their messages, it says, "The sun shines on the worlds of other Karl Hynke Macha".
What if the book's out?
Do you care what the reader thinks?
The feedback you get from people reading the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take 300 crowns and are willing to read 500 pages of text.
And then, maybe years later, they come to me on the street and they thank me for helping them with my book on some of their tough life decisions.
Books are actually "livings" or, better put, "worlds".
They're coded in alphabetical characters, they're experiential, they're a history of the regions of that language.
Anytime we can bring them to life by letting their sentences flow into our brains.
It's actually, in a way, something forbidden by God -- to awaken more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It's a fact whose DNA is lined up with old demonology books that say we do witchcraft.
After the book is published, as is often the case, you'll have a series of authorial readings.
I remember you used to like to read.
Are you happy to get back into it, or do you feel different after all these years?
I'd rather tell you the story today.
And what did I find out?
There are good, intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic trait is that they are inconspicuous, overly self-absorbed, friendly, and you don't feel lonely with them.
To give an example, in the small town of Red Mosque, there was (and I hope there is) a crooked bookkeeper (properly called Red), a cheerful companion, and a good girl's bull.
At one piety, he introduced me to the individual articles of the chain of readers of my book The Cradle.
I looked them in the eye and then they showed me a smashed, unopened copy of my book.
I put down the breakfast table in shame and cried a little manly.
We were all standing there, waving and crying drunk and in awe.
Then the young blonde blender couldn't stand it and jumped out of the window in a snowball with a scream.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran into the night landscape and grabbed the happy, angry senses, the painful souls of the pencils and the stinging of the trapped patriots, weeping and waving like werewolves until morning.
Each of your books is different formally and contentally than the previous ones.
Does this also apply to the text Wind, darkness, presence?
It's a story.
It's a tale of one country, nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin, in his novel Suchodol, puts into the mouth of the folk healer the words of an old Russian fairy tale: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a dog lying there with a grey box on it.
Horror, horror, mystery.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Maybe we were once devils in hell and were drawing a lot of money on what role we'd play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to let the flow of inspiration flow again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar March.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something enormous and unnamed, like the movement of continents on the planet, affects our wills from such a depth and breadth that it completely surpasses our horizon - and so we act with absolute certainty precisely in the intentions of our programmed task.
We're rewarded with an influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We are biological machines.
We want to mate, we die defending and acquiring new personal territories.
Sometimes there's a disorder and we're gonna have compassion.
Only then can we call people.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of all kinds of defects, standing on the shores of an ocean of unconsciousness, catching tides of wind in a hollow sailing made of dirty pocket.
I have to write to be human.
Obama is retiring from health care.
After a wave of criticism yesterday, President Obama backed away from his often-repeated and ambitious promise that if you like your health care program, you can keep it.
With hundreds of thousands of complaints of termination from providers, Republicans have accused the president of deceiving the American public in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama broke his original promise.
"The vast majority of people who have functioning health insurance can keep it", he said in his speech in Boston.
In response to what he called "a media frenzy" over the depositions, Obama urged the Americans who received the announcement to look for new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more complex health care program at the same cost or even cheaper than previously thought.
"You'll get a better offer", he said.
His administration claims that it should come as no surprise that 5% of the population who have purchased insurance for themselves may be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
I'm telling these Americans straight away: you deserve better, said Sebelius in her statement to the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the internet marketplace had been in operation since October.
"I'm disappointed and angry like everyone else", she said.
I'll try to regain your trust.
This quote, recorded with a microphone on, was uttered by the agitated Sebelius yesterday to the counselor sitting behind her at the committee meeting yesterday, which followed a tumultuous exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, about whether she herself should be involved in Obama's care program.
For more than three hours during the Sebelius hearing, he repeatedly questioned why the Architect of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance and purchase the program through HealthCare.gov, which is now enforcing millions of Americans.
Which billionaire are you gonna call next year?
Kellner, owner of PPF, wants to buy the O2 operator.
Both companies have confirmed the deal, and sources from both the agency and the backstage say it's already hand in hand.
The transaction is expected to be notified as early as November, probably before the start of the LTE frequency auction, i.e. before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Mosárek owns the KKCG group.
The one under the Sazka Telecommunications brand has auctioned frequencies for LTE networks.
And to the general surprise, until then, there was no mention of the company's desire to penetrate telecommunications.
But the trial is now run by a very experienced telecoms man named Robert Chvatal.
He started as the marketing manager of Radiomobil (now T-Mobile), later became the CEO of Slovak T-Mobile and lastly headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
The sucker plays several cards at once.
She's signed up for an auction and now she's admitting she wants to run a virtual at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If the auction is successful, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
This would probably not be pleasing to Vodafone under normal circumstances, but according to the Economic Newspapers, this could be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently under contract to rival operators O2 and T-Mobile to fully share its networks.
Vodafone needs a partner so much.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the LTE tender (as a newcomer can bid on specially designed spectrum), Vodafone does not have to bid at all or will not be affected by the price of only limited spectrum (there are not enough frequencies for all).
Vodafone can share the network with Sazka.
Vodafone will launch Sazka into its 2G/3G network (in respect of the newly built 900 MHz LTE network), thus enabling the company to start the network quickly.
In the meantime, the tender will start building an LTE freight network that will be used by Vodafone.
Both companies can be satisfied.
The savings could then be spent on some fixed internet or cable television provider.
What about Kellner?
The purchase of Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovak branch is a Czech subsidiary) would immediately result in a fully-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big wharf waiting for restructuring.
In the auction, the LTE network would be acquired by Kellner for O2 and most likely in conjunction with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already declared that they will share their networks.
The auction could finally be successful, but not with the high amounts the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic can choose between calling Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Moscar.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Will Czech TV ever go around without a signature event?
The era of President Zeman has been marked by the legendary scenes of the garbage disposal, so it's not hard to hear complaints that gather evidence of the castle crew's protest.
In the past, the traded influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdić has never been documented in this way, let alone signed.
Right, the board of directors came by.
However, the cases described do not answer the question of where some journalists' affection for the common people comes from - whether it is in response to a direct order or, not to mention vulgarism, a typical expression of inappropriate empathy.
And given the general corruption, it is hard to ignore the question of whether the change of proportions on television is being pursued by other, no less unscrupulous, interests of power that have not yet had the opportunity.
Those who say that in developed countries there are no attempts to manipulate politicians into broadcasting are right.
The truth is, however, that this does not mean that there would be no complaints on the publicly-regulated media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize mainly what they consider to be their own tendency, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we're just not at this stage of civilization yet, and this is not the situation.
But perhaps even in a country that claims to be the most corrupt in the world, black-and-white stories of bad politicians and good journalists are more comfortable than more complicated descriptions of a glaring situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings is involved.
The curse of this country: Presidents on the brink of power
It's almost a rule that at key moments in the country, the head of state wasn't in a form that would allow him to fulfill his civic duties.
If T. Masaryk were five years younger physically and mentally, he would have lived to the end of his presidency and the events around Munich would have taken place a little differently.
We might not win the war, but after symbolic resistance, the air force could fly over borders, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London immediately and not fight hard for its legitimacy.
And most of all, the nation would not have a nomad to this day.
Benesch was not a statesman and was still fit in Munich, but during the war he was already starting to get off the ground and in February 48 he acted accordingly.
If he had been a little better, he could have gone into exile a third time and undermined the legitimacy of the communists and their coup.
It's a shame to talk about Hach.
They voted him out of office saying "Mr. President will not get in the position of making a decision".
But he had to, even though the big decision was not to be made with a knife to Hitler's neck in the chancellery.
The head of intelligence, Franz Moravec, until the last days of March 1939, said that everything should be done to prevent the occupation, which he knew exactly on the day, from going so smoothly and with such profits to the Germans.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, on the one hand they didn't trust him, on the other they were afraid.
The human wreckage Gottwald had his aging comrades executed, as Moscow had instructed him.
Ludvík Svoboda was definitely unable to participate in the normalization and had to be removed, already completely insane.
That Husák was helpless and sick depressed old man made the events of November 89 easier, but that's the only good.
Havel was lucky he wasn't seen in office the last few years, spared the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis retired, but many of his actions suggest that thought processes are not what they used to be.
Well, here we go.
The head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces looks exactly what he looks like, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, the Republic is not under threat from outside.
Or maybe it's threatened, just not visible.
Then the question is, is it exceptionally (historically) good that the president is not fully in power?
It's not a normal condition.
Couldn't we elect a president in this country once again, someone who's reasonably mindful and reasonably healthy?
Distant planets, black and white movies, or a little fantasy about alien life on Earth are not topics American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would throw up unusually.
In his quartet, which will conclude this year's Struna Festival of Autumn on November 6th in the Grand Hall of Lucerne, Prague, everything is connected to everything.
The score of jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter's quartet is the momentary feelings of the musicians.
According to his assignment, in two generations, younger colleagues are supposed to play what they're experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber affair and think not of harmony or rhythm but of film scenes.
This principle, however, is not explained by the recent 80-year-old Shorter - an outstanding composer, nine-time Grammy winner, former colleague Miles Davis, and arguably the greatest living jazz saxophonist today.
He doesn't talk much about music, although his overall view of life is closely related to music.
In my 80's, I came to the conclusion that it is best to let life surprise you.
"Too many people plan everything and then get disappointed when things go differently", says Shorter.
How insects from Thailand increased sales of a Paris bar
You may be staring at insects and not realize that you will eat about half a pound of them a year completely voluntarily.
Like, melted in the flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you're definitely trending: it's organic, nutritious, and you're also taking care of a unique experience.
He placed the insect offer first in Paris on a food stamp of his establishment in early October, Elie Daviron, chef and owner of the bar Le Festin Nu.
The bar, whose name was inspired by William Burroughs' book Naked Lunch, is a popular tourist attraction in the fashionable 18th arrondissement near Montmartre.
With fresh avocados, fried red peppers, ginger, and scrambled eggs, guests can taste not only the various larvae, lobsters, and water bugs, but also the bark.
Carefully packed (to prevent the insect from damaging its wings, legs or eyes) deliveries are sent from Thailand to Daviron.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, it's common elsewhere.
The owner of a Paris bar with a pioneer menu lists several reasons why insects should be eaten.
The first is the ecological benefit, because insect production is much less expensive for our planet (in terms of finances, space and water consumption) than traditional meat.
"In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids", Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef will not deny his profession, but simply set out to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
He thinks he's making the right restaurant a pleasure, a sense of sin and an atmosphere of environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just bringing a new experience", he confessed.
Not everyone would be thrilled by the idea of eating a beetle decorated with a feather, but the owner says that the reaction of Paris bar customers to the insect served is very positive.
Even skeptics are said to eventually taste it, even starting with the smallest of the seeds and finally choosing a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from 5 to 9 euros.
President of the Union of Construction Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: New green savings should continue
The Czech construction industry has been experiencing a continuous decline in the volume of contracts since 2008 and the state's unwillingness to address the investment construction problem.
The announcement of the New Green Savings Programme was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises in the individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who will save substantial amounts of heating after the measures are implemented, but also for construction companies and building materials manufacturers.
Each billion invested will create more than 2,700 new jobs for the state.
In terms of fiscal policy, the leverage and multiplier effects are significant, and it is also one of the most significant growth measures.
The Union of construction entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic therefore fundamentally disagrees with the Government's decision and calls for the implementation of such measures as would allow the programme to continue in order to allow for further challenges to be declared under it.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts in accordance with Article 21 of this Regulation.
The dog pulled the rug, the president kicked it, and he ended up with a barrel.
President Miloš Zeman left the Motol hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night in bed, and went to the castle in Lajnes.
What's his medical condition?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that American espionage had gone too far.
John Kerry has hinted at a weakening of the US defense stance on its surveillance programs, and in an unprecedented confession he said that in some cases, espionage has gone too far.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting like "autopilots" in light of the annoying revelations of NSA espionage that emerged thanks to whistleblower Edward Snowden.
The information released has sparked a diplomatic storm between the US government and its allies.
Mr Kerry said via video link at an open government conference in London: "There is no doubt that the president and I and the rest of the government have actually learned about some of the things that were happening from the very beginning, because this possibility was there, in reference to World War II, the difficult period of the Cold War and then of course 9/11".
He became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had crossed the border, but stressed that no one's rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it went too far".
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify this to the people and is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels there has been abuse.
I assure you that there will be no abuse of the rights of innocent people in this trial.
But Mr. Kerry insisted that the NSA was doing good and that its surveillance operations saved many lives.
He added: "We are facing a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up".
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to kill and blow up people and attack governments.
And what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being executed because we can already know about these plans ahead of time.
The chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday that U.S. lawmakers were heading to Europe to respond to foreign concerns about alleged U.S. espionage and convince Europeans that they still need to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about their threats to stop participating in counterterrorism organizations because they were disappointed by the National Security Agency's (NSA) surveillance.
It is really important for the national security interests of the United States that Europe remains on board with us, in view of our joint efforts to fight terrorism, said Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, in an interview with Washington.
And I'm heading to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism despite their anger at NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA was collecting millions of phone records in Europe have disrupted relations with some US allies, even though the agency's chief this week said they were inaccurate and reflected misunderstandings about the metadata that NATO allies were collecting and sharing with the United States,
Another revelation cited documents disclosed by Snowden that the NSA was tracking the cell phones of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has argued that Allied espionage is necessary and said that it is a matter of common concern on both sides.
In the midst of the scandal, Murphy said his office was planning a parliamentary trip to be held this year, and he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and the House.
The names of the other lawmakers who intend to participate are to be released in the coming days.
He said the program was still in the works.
Although Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to help repair the relationship, he added that well-meaning educational measures would also be in place.
He said European leaders must be honest with their own people about the spy programs they have been using for years.
"While we are adjusting our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also realize that we are not the only ones doing espionage here", Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is headed, as planned, this weekend to the Middle East and Poland in response to hostilities already provoked by US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance.
Australian woman appealed against her stay in Thai prison
A 21-year-old Sydney woman who was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island for falsely claiming to have been attacked by a taxi driver has appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally charged with perjury by a local court on Phuket Island on June 15 when Thai police said that a taxi driver and two other men who allegedly detained her attacked her in the early hours of Sunday, June 10.
However, a television recording later revealed that after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend, she returned safely to her hotel.
Police on Phuket Island interviewed Bamford two days before she found out she had made up the story.
She was held in a local police cell before the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security correctional facility on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of being placed in an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunces, who had asked the Foreign Office in Canberra for help in his daughter's case.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was extremely concerned about their daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"It's obviously a difficult time, but we hope he comes back to us safe as soon as possible", Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
Australian reports say she has been on holiday in the Krabi recreation area in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that an appeal could lead to a court case that would increase her sentence and result in her being placed in an adult prison.
But after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also try to correct the stigma for tourists, which may have been behind the acquittal verdict.
The juggernaut was joking, "Goal from the breaker?"
He got a punch in the defence belt and no one caught him again.
Plus, he turned the escape into a fast foreshortening call.
Jaromir Jagr scored against Tampa on Wednesday night, and then on Thursday night, the 119th NHL winning goal commented on Facebook.
"After watching this video, my agent Petr Svobodov was contacted by the Czech Railways Director and asked if I would be interested in advertising their state-of-the-art Pendolino train!" wrote Jagr in the introduction, with a hyperbole.
I hear we're kind of alike.
I guess I'll have to finish the night practice to keep my speed down.
"I'm afraid the Secretary of Defense might call and want to advertise the jets!" he added with a smile.
New Jersey has also claimed their second straight win.
"And most importantly, you've noticed - the treatment of Maria Rottr takes", concluded Jagr.
Other, of a kind used for the manufacture of goods of heading 8106
The October election, rather than the winners, brought a bunch of losers.
These are not only parties that have not even entered the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the CFSP because of their internal division.
Politicians have been serving us a goose on the weekend instead of Christmas candles.
The election leap was made by the Andrey Babiš movement, which promised voters to change the political style of government they had so far.
The split in the election result and the split in the winning party record the political (s) for President Miloš Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the voters who did not elect the party that President Zeman publicly supported to the Chamber of Deputies.
While the president has lost strategic advantage over other politicians because of an unpleasant event, he still has a few ways to regain it - for example, by electing a future prime minister.
While the chances of the CFSP gaining the Prime Minister's seat are far from my point of view, they are approaching entrepreneur Andrey Babiš.
Although the election is still a long way from a quick and smooth establishment of a stable government, compared to the election scenario of the communist-backed leftist government of the USSR, this development is a better news for business and therefore the economy in the Czech Republic.
Given the strong opposition of the ANO to combine with the ODS or TOP 09, it is increasingly the most likely variant of the CSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL coalition (total 111 deputies).
Given the split in the CFSP, which has thus become an unreadable and weak negotiating partner, the outcome of the coalition negotiations may be quite disappointing for the CFSP.
The minority government of the CZSSD composed of "non-citizens" at the Castle is unlikely to pass.
In addition, any government in which the CSSD participates will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to further division in the party.
So I ask myself, "Are we not going to sing for the next early election?"
The next election would be more a referendum on the power of the ANO mandate.
The plans of the SSC to introduce sectoral taxes, to increase income taxes more significantly or to build a state bank have hopefully fallen under the table.
The parties to the CFSP, the ANO, the KDU-ČSL and the UZvit, on the other hand, agree, for example, to support business, moderate fiscal policies (government deficit below 3% of GDP), to support employment of disadvantaged persons, and to reduce the lower VAT rate on selected goods.
The third area is most prevalent in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
But the ANO is now on top, so the program of the most likely coalition of the ANO, the CSSD, the KDU-CSSL would be more to the right.
Which, in my view, is ultimately a better outcome than a left-wing tax program on everything that's still moving in the economy.
