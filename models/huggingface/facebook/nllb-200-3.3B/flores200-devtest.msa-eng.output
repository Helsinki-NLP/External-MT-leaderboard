This not only confirms that certain dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but provides specific details that fossils generally cannot, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's fur is brownish-brown on the upper surface with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
Studies also provide insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have well-developed trunks, called rakis, but had other feather features - spines and barbels - the researchers concluded that rakis was likely an evolutionary development of these other features that came later.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight purposes but rather for temperature control or for display. The researchers suggested that, although the tail was that of a young dinosaur, the sample showed feathers belonged to an adult and not a juvenile.
The researchers suggested that, even though it was a young dinosaur tail, the sample showed adult hairs and not the delicate hairs of a chick.

The road to the crash site is temporarily closed for emergency services to relieve the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially treated at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
His brother is already in Edinburgh Sheriff Court on a charge of murdering his son.
He's in custody pending indictment and trial, but any witness evidence may have been compromised because his picture was publicly released.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK but the judicial function in Scotland is different and the courts consider the publication of the photo to be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said "journalists are walking on dangerous roads if they publish photos and other material belonging to suspects".
The Crown Office, which is responsible for the entire prosecution, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
Based on leaked documents, the document refers to the boundary dispute claimed by the Palestinians based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics covered reportedly include the future state of Jerusalem which is sacred to both countries and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demanded a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement was signed while the PA agreed to a military presence for only five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control experiment must be closely monitored by the ranger, while the experiment is monitored and evaluated for its effectiveness.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sport Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick OFlynn, Acting Director of Park Conversation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Martelly was sworn in to the new nine-member Provisional Election Council (CEP) yesterday.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
A Presidential Commission last month recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a move to mobilize the country for the implementation of new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime riots that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had taken place since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods that overheated have been reported, causing a total of six fires and four people to blaze.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that they were aware of 27 accidents associated with the device.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had announced an additional 34 extreme warming events, but the company took it "not seriously".
The ministry has responded by calling the delay in the report from Apple "extremely disappointing".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said that no damage was reported in the state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired an M16 rifle at the tourists.
Some hostages have been rescued and at least six confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly citizens, were released early, as was the Filipino photographer.
The photographer then takes the old lady's place because she needs to use the restroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began her career at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that if given the hormone it would accelerate the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer says, "Luna was Extreme's first queen, my first manager, and Luna died on the night of the second moon, pretty unique as she was, a strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels comments "My weird moon...maybe more...loves him and will miss him...may his soul be in heaven".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those in this poll think that they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last king of Australia.
At the extreme of the public opinion poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible while 31 percent believe that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle events and in three Commonwealth Games relays, but her complaints led many to question her fitness.
He was unable to take the medicine needed to suppress his pain because it had been forbidden from the Resistance.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri has found the largest prime number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of the water that brought Earth and the organic material that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how Earth formed, since a comet collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month allowing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumor "political talk and nonsense".
He is speculated to be the president in 2016.
NextGen is an FAA claim system that will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology over older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately detect the location of aircraft and provide more precise information to pilots.
No additional transport is provided and the overground train will not stop at Wembley, while car parking facilities as well as parking and boarding are not available at the ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would be played without a team sponsor.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reports on the formation of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species has evolved after only two generations, although this process is believed to have taken longer, due to cross-breeding between a Darwin endemic finch, fortes Geospiza, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be molded into many different shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled into thin wires, which can then be twisted and woven.
It can be made very thin, and it can be attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it can be used to decorate books with hand-drawn drawings called manuscripts.
This is called the chemical pH. You can make a marker using the juice of red cabbage.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline a chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton with an electron removed (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Sprinkle both dry powders and then, with clean wet hands, pile the powder into a bead.
The fluid on the hand will act on the outer layer, which will feel weird and form a shell-like layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have a toilet in almost every house connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of the sewer system have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Bathrooms were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and by the time of the Roman civilization, they were part of the public bathhouse, where men and women mingled freely.
When you're calling someone thousands of miles away, that means you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space got a call and bounced it back down, almost instantly.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use space-based telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere interferes with our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or a telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way, and its greatest contribution to us is the creation of easier and faster transportation.
It has brought us trains, cars, and many other transportation devices.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey from rabbits to deer and roaches.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral cats) that eat more small prey such as insects, mice, cicadas and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special task for each cat that prevents it from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social of the cats, and live in large groups called "lion packs".
A pride is made up of one to three adult lions, along with up to thirty lions and their cubs.
Women are often close to one another, as they are part of a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion Prides behave much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are similar in their snarling behaviour to lions (but not big cats) and are also very dangerous to their prey.
Ready to attack, tigers can climb (though not so good), swim, jump long distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers are in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, star tigers, and jaguars.
The roar of the tiger is not like the roar of a lion, but the roar of a long-winded word, the cry of a word.
The oseloth tiger preys on small animals, and will catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds if it can, almost all of which are much smaller than its own size.
Scientists believe that the oselot tracks and hunts for prey through its sense of smell, which is the sense of the soil it has passed.
The ocelot can see well using night vision, and also moves slowly. The ocelot hunts its prey by hiding in an environment that resembles its body color and then pouncing on its prey.
When small groups of organisms (small populations) become separated from the main population from which they originated (for example if they wander across mountains or rivers, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot relocate easily) they often end up in a different environment than before.
These new environments are resource-diverse and have different competition, so the new populations will need different characteristics or adaptations to be stronger competitors than what they needed before.
The original inhabitants haven't changed at all, they still need to adapt as much as before.
Over time, as the new residents began to adapt to their new surroundings, they began to look less and less like other residents.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they are no longer of the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans inhale and take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale (when breathing).
Plants produce food from sunlight by photosynthesis.
We build our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is plants, and without plants, animals cannot live.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, making it fearless of anything, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws are equipped with over 70 sharp teeth, along with an additional set of teeth located in its jaws, which means there is no escape for anything that crosses its path.
We're not sure, but it may have a forked tongue, a diet that includes turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even be a cannibal.
It also attacks anything that enters the water, and even a giant dinosaur like T. rex couldn't compete with it.
Although most of their food is familiar, the Romans also had some strange or exotic meals, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of mouse called a dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women eat their meals while sitting in chairs, the rich people like to have a banquet together where they will relax by their side while they eat their meals.
Ancient Roman cuisine was unlikely to include foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built primary temples for each of their gods, which they considered the home of the god.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and the priest would try to fulfill the gods' needs through various ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctum that was only open to priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built to be part of such temples.
The tops of the towers were a shelter for the deities.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house is no longer so important.
Most of Hebrew family life took place in an open environment.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shop was just an open counter facing the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was a very expensive resource.
Greenland is sparsely populated. According to Norse legend, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while on a journey west, found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimos were already settled there at that time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences in people, kings, culture and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie "National Treasure", you probably thought of a treasure map inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true, even though there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence  The original Declaration of Independence was dated 4 July 1776. The text is written under the document, in reverse.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in his life, this large document (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
So it's possible that the notation was added just as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not liberated.
It was ruled by the French Vichy, who had made peace with Germany in 1940 and had chosen to cooperate with the occupants rather than oppose them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, in what was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France and turned toward the Germans.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people living and working in close cooperation, a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas meaning city or town, and that too however defines the size of a society.
Cities are the beginning of a nation. Culture of civilization signifies the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the trace of culture that is ever present and the equitable distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as a perfect civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress has no power to tax and, because there is no national judicial executive, it relies on the powers of the states, which often do not cooperate, to enforce all of its acts.
Nor does it have the right to reject interstate tax and tariff laws.
This article required unanimous consent from all counties before they could amend and the counties took the central government lightly because their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful national team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, wheelchair hockey and F1 motorcycle racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the North, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan contains nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because the islands belong to the State of Japan, the State of Japan rather than a geographical entity, is usually referred to as an archipelago.
As early as the 15th century, European traders began to see and record Taiwan, calling it IIha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established bases in southwestern Taiwan, transforming the native peoples' grain production practices and hiring Chinese labor to work in rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Window Room.
Most of the old buildings have been restored to give tourists an idea of how they looked originally.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu would have been restored and restoration work continues to this day
For example, the most common image in the fortography format in the world is 35mm, which corresponds to the dominant size of film at the end of the analog film era.
It's still produced today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio has been inherited by the image-sensing format of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, it's a bit confusing, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided into twelve to get the easiest overall ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. formats from the APS family) are identical or nearly identical to these aspect ratios.
The often misused and tainted rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining ordered size in the image.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection between the lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become enormously wealthy and powerful, began to be questioned.
For over a thousand years Christianity has bound the countries of Europe together despite differences in language and official customs.
Its absolute power affects everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate poverty and misery and the church's financial resources are dedicated to that cause.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and the power and money of the church had caused many to question whether this trust had been fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of the battle, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade did not comply with generally accepted international law as embodied by several international treaties two centuries ago.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering the rest of the ocean, causing danger even to ordinary vessels.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, the Germans expected the same response as the unlimited submarine war.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude for most people and countries was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, some nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job offer with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents in his name, a book of verse and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his old workplace) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time, each rank of China or each ruling family of the time had its own dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also a period of unstable and fragmented territory, most famously the Three Kingdoms period that lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this time, fierce fighting broke out between several nobles who were vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was a bloody era in the history of Ancient China. Thousands of dead fought for the highest seat in the great palace of Xian.
Various social and political effects would exist such as the adoption of the metric system, the change from absolute rule to a republican system, and the awareness and spirit of nationalism that the state belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
And, after the Revolution, jobs were opened to all male applicants allowing those who were most ambitious and successful to succeed.
So is the military because instead of ranking by class it's now by caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things outside of this ordinary life. He often visited a cave later known as Hira on Mount Noor (light) to think.
He's self-taught, he's enduring all the time, he gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on a mountain peak north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's not easy to find, even if you know it exists, but once you step into this cave, it's completely deserted.
Nothing is seen but the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, and only the whisper of the world is heard or seen from this cave.
The great pyramid at Giza is one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramid structures built to commemorate the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Nekropolis of Giza in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (among the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and a great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The sign  swipe up is similar to the letter V and  swipe down is similar to the shape of a square or a rectangle without the bottom.
Up means you have to start from the end and push the bow, and down means you have to start on the frog (the part where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up bow usually produces a soft sound while a down-bow produces a stronger, assertive sound.
Feel free to write your own signs, but it should be noted that the printed subtitles are there for musical purposes.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a group of women in the market.
Riding in a carriage, they returned to Paris and were surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats to the King and Queen.
A mob has forced the King and Queen to open their wide pedestrian windows.
At one point, a troublemaker raised the head of the royal guard who was killed at Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to bear the bulk of the expenses and the benefits of the floating bonds on behalf of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Of course, the great profits associated with the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the basic profits of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that drove the creation of the Order.
The era in which the events occurred is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000 -1300)
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas that are held, from technological progress or technological primacy to the strong sense that human destiny is driven by logic related to scientific laws manifested through technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology has an "effect" on existing society, rather than social conditions.
For example, one might say that motor vehicles led to the construction of roads.
However, the nationwide road network was not viable for just a few cars, so new methods of production were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The high car ownership also resulted in an increase in road accidents which led to the creation of new techniques in health care to restore injured body parts.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, inspired by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and with the passage of time came customs and cultures related to this geography, and these, which were more in harmony with the social status, were better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the center of the contemporary world of fashion, Constantinople is considered the center of feudal European fashion.
It was famous as a center of luxury starting around 400 AD and lasting until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century mainly due to the Crusaders who returned with gifts such as silk and spices worth hundreds more than what was offered in the Byzantine market.
At this time the exchange of the title of Fashion Model from Constantinople to Paris was made.
The Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
At first the dress was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, the western style may be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style.
Self-agriculture is farming that is carried out to produce food for the needs of the farmers and their outlets.
Self-cultivation is a simple, often organic, system that uses stored seeds that originate from a single ecological area and combines them with rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers were involved in agriculture for a living, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel they are being ignored by society's standards and allow them to develop their own identities.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define different cultural branches may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, sexual politics, geography or a combination of factors.
Members of a particular cultural branch typically display their membership through a certain style symbolically, whether in the form of fashion, behavior, and language.
One of the most commonly used methods of describing the importance of socialization is to take into account some unfortunate cases of children being neglected, harmed, or abused by deliberately not socializing with adults when they grow up.
Such children are termed feral or savages. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually the parents themselves); in some cases this child neglect is due to the parents rejecting the severe intellectual or physical disability of the child.
Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Other children were allegedly raised by animals; some were said to live alone in the forest.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, a feral child will exhibit behaviors (within the physical limits) almost entirely like those of the animal that cares for it, such as a fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, the scaffolding provides more than that.
Scaffolding is not a way of learning but rather an aid that supports individuals in experiencing new learning experiences such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
A role can be virtual or real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of role-player and so is the little paper clip guy in Microsoft Office.
The Maya Scaffold is integrated into the software and acts to question, assist, and explain procedures that might be difficult for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed with foster families for a variety of reasons including neglect, abuse and even for exploitation purposes.
No child should grow up in a careless, neglected, educated environment, but they do.
We see the Maintenance System as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care should provide all the needs that cannot be provided in the home where the child is taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet bring an additional dimension in terms of approaches to use and satisfaction.
For example, learning and realization are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al, 1995).
Personal engagement and continued relationships were identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements lasting several milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can detect whether a person is lying by interpreting small facial changes correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his work The President Speaks, showed how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He suggested that the ability to interpret human behavior might be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century studies have shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
New genetic mutations are the addition of mutations and selection of eliminations from the set of mutations that are highlighted.
Separation and recombination reshaped the variation between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it's very difficult for a primate with a digestive system like a human to meet the amino acid needs from existing plant sources.
Furthermore, failure to do so can have serious consequences: increased depression, unbalanced diet, and eventual death.
The easiest plant source of protein is found in leaves and beans, but this is difficult for primates like us to digest unless it's cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (ant, duckweed, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they provide high-quality protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors overcame their protein problems in the same way that the chimps in the savanna do today.
A sleep disorder is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep briefly (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily using a silent alarm clock to wake you up without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting your clock in your sleep, the clock can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option involves drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, the diuretic of which is unknown) before bedtime, forcing a person to get up to pee.
The amount of mental calmness of a person has an inverse correlation to the amount of physical and mental tension of a person.
The lower the stress, the more the spirit of positive living is present.
The only thing that prevents us from reaching this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been extended by the mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism has very simple principles, it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of love all around.
Kundalini energy (the energy of consciousness) is triggered with Kundalini Yoga through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The basis of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of Gods, depicting various gods cleansing energy channels, activating chakras and creating inner awareness.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to the cooperation between the USSR and the USA. By the end of the war, the clash of systems, processes and cultures had led to the countries to side.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It will last for the next 40 years and will be fought in the flesh by proxy armies on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences had collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and re-assemble along the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans became obsolete in the interim, after 800,000 troops from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods was the most effective way to move large amounts of people and goods across the oceans.
Traditionally, the Navy's job has been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move people and goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most famous recent examples of this is the WWII North Atlantic campaign, in which the Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy, using U-boats, was trying to stop the traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have conquered Britain just as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and peoples began to raise them to obtain milk, wool, meat and skin more easily.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds grazing on hills or other pastures, often tended by shepherds who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the shepherds more familiar today.
The crane was built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriage track consisted only of parallel wooden planks, it allowed the horse to pull at higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than the rougher roads of the day.
Cross-linking was introduced relatively early to hold local tracks. Landai, however, realized that tracks would be more efficient if they had iron rails on the top.
This has become a custom, yet the iron has made the wooden wheels of the wagon dull.
In time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron track was launched.
The first known transportation was walking, humans started walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means erect male).
Their overseers, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright by nature.
Bipedal speciation is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
It's like symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we don't want to just have a temporary solution, then we have to find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
It is quite clear that the world is changing dramatically because of the advances in human science and technology and the problems are getting bigger because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of humans.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4th, a written draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
Overnight between 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of this document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, read to his troops in New York on July 9th, and the other arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 known extant large-scale editions of the Dunlap are the oldest extant copies of the document. The original handwritten copies are no longer in existence.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive, and we call them birds.
Many people don't think of it as a dinosaur because it has plumage and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
It has scaly legs and it chews, it lays eggs, and it walks on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers can only contain one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and such numbers are known as binary digits, or bits, in computer terms.
Internal toxicity cannot be quickly proven. Symptoms, such as vomiting are quite common so it cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The best clue to internal poisoning may be the remnants of an open medicine container or toxic household detergent.
Check the label for the specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term pepijat is used by entomologists formally for this group of insects.
The term comes from an ancient habit of biting, which is an insect that has adapted well to become a parasite of humans.
Both killer whale and massager-fish are altruistic, adapting to live in a hive or a dwelling.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A married couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In the process of adoption, the original parents terminate their parental rights so that the other spouse can take over as the child's parent.
The ultimate goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which is actually the guiding principle of most scientific research.
It is not solitary, experimentation and experimentation are tests used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations as well as guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, especially, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's critiques have been accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the Western world found itself deprived of its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are usually very much dependent on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external cues, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clock is a self-winding oscillator that will continue to cycle independently even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase have used faj, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two tests that marked whether the DNA in the phage was radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein was radioactive sulfur.
Mutations have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the cells involved are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people to visit natural areas with the aim of enjoying the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities that can be done include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and learning information about ecosystems.
For example, visiting, taking photos, and learning about the Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small towns in cars to go to work and are passed by others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transportation, everyone, in whatever way, is connected and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now shows that a massive carbon economy has freed the biosphere from one of its stable bases that once supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the association and uses the transport system. Almost everyone complains about the transport system.
In developed countries you rarely hear similar complaints about the quality of water or a collapsed bridge.
Why does the transportation system cause such complaints, why does it fail every day? Is it because of incompetent transportation engineers? Or is there something wrong at the fundamental level?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow analysis is difficult because the behavior of drivers is not 100% predictable.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a fairly consistent manner; thus, traffic flows are also fairly consistent and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back to the side of their bodies.
This gives them a wide area of small places to hide from predators.
Now, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the butterfly and the mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people think he is right but many believe the opposite; that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
It makes sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, and it holds more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at six miles.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of tributaries.
Although pyramid construction continued to use stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza never surpassed in size and technical brilliance their construction
The new ancient Egyptian kingdoms admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in law and official communications.
Italian is the daily language used by most of those who work in the country while Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because these can all be found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all things were made of a mixture of four or more elements: earth, water, wind, and fire.
It's more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it's also theorized that they transformed into new materials to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of an atom is so small that a few trillion of them could fit in a comma at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was created.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods emerged, the pencil was downgraded to a very low status and use.
People now write messages on computer screens, without having to be near the sharpener.
We can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new appears.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to combine the nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's like pulling a heavy object up a hill, separating the nucleus once more and then releasing some of that energy.
Certain atoms have unstable nuclei which means they can be separated with little or no contact.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner below the maria and thicker in the high ground.
There may be more tides in the adjacent parts because the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory is focused on finding out what makes people tick or appeal to them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are met when they reach maturity as adults.
These theories look at what's inside a person that makes them want the things they want and what's in their environment that will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and the Hertzberg Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading their former co-workers. On one end of the spectrum is an attempt to remain part of the old gang of friends.
Such managers have difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing orderly actions, performance appraisals, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, one would become an unrecognizable individual who felt that he had to change everything that the team had done and give it a personal touch.
After all, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to conflict between the leader and the other members of the group.
Virtual teams are held to the same standard of excellence as conventional teams, but the differences are subtle.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for physically adjacent groups.
They typically have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of an unseen team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The Invisible Team is a management team where all members report. This invisible team sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to engage in the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization?
When all resources are used effectively across every functional part of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
As a result, the processes of organizations working together to overcome barriers can lead to new innovative processes to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and organizational knowledge sharing and learning.
Angel (2006), describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
The neurobiology data provides physical evidence of the theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, thus refining the field of research that makes it more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It's long been known that different types of brain injuries, trauma, wounds and tumors can affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
While AI has strong connotations with science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the attitudes, learning and intelligent adaptation in machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose customer responses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Things like this have become a separate discipline, which is focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as have been built into some home computer and video game software applications.
A study tour is a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher wants to take his students somewhere that they cannot visit by taking a bus.
Technology offers a solution with virtual tours, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in a classroom.
Sharing the tour virtually is a great way to describe the tour and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their visit to the state capital, and every year the website is updated, but the old version is kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. While students often start their blogging experience with grammar and spelling mistakes, the presence of an audience in general can change that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger started to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also  forces students to be more aware of the world around them. The need to capture the interest of readers inspires students to write intelligently and engagingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can give students the opportunity to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to internet materials, students can determine their position in the context of others' writing and also outline their own perspective on related issues (Oravec. 2002)
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital with a variety of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and the northern part is the Muskoka and its untouched bypass natural beauty.
All of these and more make Ontario the true Canadian experience for out-of-town visitors.
Large parts of the northern part are sparsely occupied and part of the northern part is a barely inhabited wilderness.
For a surprisingly large population comparison: There are more African Americans living in the U.S. than Canadians.
The East African Archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and the continent itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are separate countries, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this land and it has been growing rapidly in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
It is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
There are advantages to wearing a ring (but not a ring that looks too expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences may result in what they perceive as disruption and it is not uncommon to be followed, pinched through the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting people, and don't be afraid to stand firm (cultural differences or not, it doesn't become ok!).
The modern city of Casablanca was discovered by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
Moroccan sultans rebuilt cities such as Daru I-Badya and gave the name Casablanca to Spanish merchants who established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
It is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods around the old Medina such as tagin, pottery, leather goods, shisha and various small ornaments, but that's just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east adjacent to Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that permeated most of the streets in the city, especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside Goma should be studied to understand the state of the ongoing war in the North Kivu region.
The city is also the site for the climb of the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to explore Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese Franc for the short trip.
Combined with its inaccessible location, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for an exotic and distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
This was one of the main stops during the PBS special Henry Louis Gates Wonders of the African World.
This city is different from other cities in the country, because it has more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and along the border of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the southern border is the Buaya River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones with each one supporting the other's wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the crown jewel of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there is a daily maintenance and admission fee for the park.
It can also be beneficial to one to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to either a selection of parks in South Africa or all of the South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong region its name and is a place considered a focal point by many tourists.
The row of buildings that decorate Hong Kong's skyline is likened to a glittering map of the harbor, increasingly reflected by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite coast of Kowloon.
The majority of urban development on the Hong Kong islands is concentrated on land that is spread along the northern coast.
This is the place where the British colonists took it as their own and if you're looking for evidence of the history of colonization of this region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, covering 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the far inland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forested part of the Indian enclave is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangroves - they are among the last few remnants of the desolate rainforests that cover the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which one-third is covered by water/swampland.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary and now an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer live in the area.
Buses depart from the bus station in the district (across the river) throughout the day, although most of them mainly those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06.30 and 07.30.
Since inter-district buses are always full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most counties have the Japan Coast Bus service, which is comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the Oyapock River with the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and it has two halls that are 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guaraní are the most significant indigenous group of people in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practice subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survive by hunting, gathering crops and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once called the "Land of the Indian Giants", was born as a result of the encounters of the Spanish conquistadors with indigenous groups.
The Spanish had begun a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve the character and identity of its original people.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here in other years.
For news on tournaments or where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP) which is pegged to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere in the islands and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
In remote islands credit cards may not be accepted, although British and United States currency may be taken; check with the owner in advance to determine what payment methods are acceptable.
It's almost impossible to change the Falklands' currency outside the islands, so change before you leave the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, it experiences summer there while it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be confusing: temperatures rarely exceed freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel cooler than the thermometer readings.
There is no specific rainy and dry season, the amount of rainfall is more or less constant throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wildlife is still wild and should not be eaten or harassed.
According to the park's officials, keep 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
How do they look so tame, that bison, deer, moose, bear, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep the right distance.
In addition, be careful that strong smells attract the attention of bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu with a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a famous naval battle in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All of them were lost, except for a British cruise ship, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau Movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the assassination of Tupua's most important chief, Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland spans two harbours. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The North Shore (in the North Harbor district) is on the Pacific Ocean and extends from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming areas and mostly shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located on Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
This is a family beach that is sometimes crowded with all sorts of shops along the shoreline.
The main local beer is Number One. It is not a complex beer, but is tasty and refreshing. Another local beer is called Manta.
There are plenty of French wines available, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're in need.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A concentrated black coffee is an "espresso", a cappuccino has a high cream (rather than foam) content, and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is the standard Belgian equivalent, fruit juices are expensive but they're delicious.
The reef is visited repeatedly throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes are rare in the reef area.
However, seek the advice of the authorities, observe all signs, pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near the coast and near the mouths of rivers from October to April of the 1770s. They are occasionally found outside of these times.
Sharks do exist, they rarely attack humans, most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
The saltwater crocodile does not live in the ocean actively, its main habitat being the estuary north of Rockhampton.
Early booking gives travelers peace of mind that they have a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with certain hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Typically, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or packages that combine the hotel and the flight at once.
They can also make an appointment for you if you need time to think about the offer or get other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any amendments or requests should be sent through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of attendees to the music festival decide to camp on site, and many of the entourage consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get in early to get a tent site close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage has ended, there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some of the parties have special campsites for families with children.
If crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as ice-crossing cruises produce a loud noise to those involved.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the city.
Casinos usually make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually not present and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have a special meal, drinks and entertainment offer, to keep guests in a good mood and keep them on the premises.
Some establishments offer alcoholic drinks at home, but drunkenness can impair judgment, and all sober gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at high latitudes or across mountains should think about the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
The icy and snowy road conditions cause low friction and you can't drive as if you were driving on a normal dirt road.
During a snowstorm, you can be covered by snow in no time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blown snow or by evaporation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow cover and cold are normal in most countries, and traffic is mostly smooth year round.
Safari is the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari is a popular term used to refer to traveling over land to see the wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and standard equipment that allows for good views.
Lion, cheetah and tiger stars are sometimes frightened and you'll see these animals better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a bush walk, hiking safari or footing) is an adventure, either for a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, having previously hosted in 1964.
If you book your flight and accommodation in 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not take effect until July 2020 when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels provide sterile boards and sterile boards for borrowing, although they are not provided in the room.
If there is no iron, or you do not like to wear socks with iron, you can try using a hairdryer, if there is one.
Please take care not to let the fabric overheat (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, a fire).
There are many ways to filter water, some methods more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, in other areas several minutes are necessary.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you're worried, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they are not used to seeing in their home countries.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or spread infection.
Self-infected diseases or dangerous animals can injure or kill people forcibly, never confirming as a pest.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from excise and customs duty at a particular location.
Travelers to heavily taxed states can sometimes save money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont provides the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often passes through remote wooded areas.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, beware of, steep grades, narrow alleys, and dominating sharp curves.
The announced speeds are clearly lower than the preceding and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than the other.
Surprisingly, cell phone service is stronger here than in other parts along the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The pastries found in Germany are quite tasty, and the Bavarian pastries are quite sweet, fatty and varied, similar to those found in the southern neighbor, Austria.
Pastries are a common fruit, with apples being made into pastries all year round, as well as cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you want a small but fatty pastry, you can try pastry named after the region of origin such as Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a herbal and spicy dish cooked with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either kering or basah depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some coastal areas of the subcontinent, santan is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without qualification, the term means food originating from the central and eastern areas of the main island of Java.
Now found throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a variety of simple dishes, typically consisting of Javanese favorites such as peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of aromatic spices.
The rack is a support for the rider's legs that hangs on either side of the saddle.
It provides more stability for the rider but there are safety risks due to the potential for the rider's leg to become entangled.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his leg is stuck to the bridle, he will be dragged in case the horse escapes.
First, most riders wear boots with flat, rather narrow heels and soles.
Next, some saddles, particularly British saddles, have safety bars that allow the leather foot pedal to drop the saddle if pulled back by the rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, with its various large walls and granite cenurams.
The lighthouse includes a magnificent view from the summit, where climbers from all over the world continue to build new routes between all its endless walls.
Downhill snowboarding, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves skiing over a snow-covered surface with skis or snowboards attached to the legs.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as  ski junkies planning the entire holiday around skiing in a particular location.
Skiing has been around for a long time  cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also known as cross-country skiing, ski touring or ski touring.
It is related to but usually does not involve alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, mountaineering is done on steep terrain and requires harder skis and shoes.
Think of the ski trail as being similar to the hiking trail.
In good times you'll cover a distance much farther than walking - yet very rarely will you get the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack in a neat lane.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through various countries means going through visa applications and passport controls several times.
But the Schengen Zone, it works a little bit like a country in this regard.
As long as you are in this zone, you can generally cross the border without going through the passport control checkpoint again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa in each Schengen member state separately, so it saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for which artifacts are antiques. Certain tax agencies define items that are over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations where age limits may be less in places such as North America than in Europe.
A craft product may be defined as an antique, even if it is older than the same material produced in the factory.
