The rapidly increasing incidence of the coronavirus (COVID-19) disease in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The increasing incidence of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases shows similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom confirming that, although at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 epidemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and emergency care units should increase their preparedness to accommodate more patients suffering from COVID-19 who will need health care, and especially emergency care.
On 31 December 2019, a group of people with unknown aetiology pneumonia conditions were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the agent causing the new coronavirus is now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 disease has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence so far shows that 80 percent of people infected with COVID-19 have a minor illness, a respiratory tract disease that may or may not be associated with pneumonia, and most of these people recover.
In 14 percent of cases, COVID-19 progresses to a more serious illness requiring hospitalization while the remaining 6 percent are facing a serious illness requiring emergency care.
The mortality rate of patients in bed due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we analyzed trends in the increasing incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and United Kingdom (UK) country and compared them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of people with COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK with that of Italy between 31 January15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 spread widely by region and the global COVID-19 pandemic is currently following the country's evolution.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The March 5, 2020, issue of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that conform to WHO's definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 to people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
By 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), meaning that between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39,768 cases of the virus had been reported and 1,727 deaths, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths were in Italy alone.
Detecting the increasing number and incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the statistics of COVID-19 cases in each country worldwide, obtained only from official sources such as the Department of Health of each country, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to analyze COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, and compared with those in Italy.
As a representative of the frequency of ongoing COVID-19 cases, we have calculated the 14 day suspended increase in COVID-19 cases, thereby taking into account the natural progression of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the period 1 January15 March 2020.
We also introduced an increasing number of reported cases per country on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m. compared to Italy during the period of 31 January15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Trends in the 14 day delayed increase in COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK are generally followed by those in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the increasing COVID-19 case began to rise around 21 February and rose sharply on 28 February 2020 (Learning Supplement).
This is compounded by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show similar increasing trends in the increasing incidence of COVID-19 (read more).
Figure 2 shows the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to that in Italy during the period 31 January15 March 2020.
It highlights that, by 8 a.m. on March 15, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total of less than that of Italy three weeks earlier or less.
Our results show that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends in the increasing prevalence of COVID-19 indicate that the epidemic is progressing at the same rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, the national public health response varies, and there are almost different interpretations of conditions in countries and different protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19, including follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients needed emergency care and media reported that hospitals and critical care units in these regions had reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 patients to hospital and/or critical care unit is available in the EU/EEA category in only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
It should, however, be compiled in an orderly manner to match current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A 201011 survey showed a marked difference in the availability of critical care and central care beds in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 critical care beds and an average of 100,000 inhabitants in 201011).
The simulation of conditions related to healthcare capacity overcrowding, which provides an average for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the increase in hospitalization for COVID-19 associated with a risk of > 90% exceeding critical care bed capacity, is provided in the sixth ECDC review of the COVID-19 emergency risk assessment.
As conditions are accumulated in certain regions in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and critical care units generally assist certain people in the region, information on conditions and critical care beds should be available at the Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Italian experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 epidemic is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and critical care units should be prepared for the ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in COVID-19 patients requiring medical care, and especially critical care, as is the case in affected regions in Italy.
As demonstrated in recent ECDC emergency risk assessments, a fast, vigorous and detailed approach is essential to slow the spread of SARS-COV-2, by making the transition from a controlled pathway to a mitigating pathway, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision-makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, adopt and adapt their responses to a timely pathway if not implemented.
Emergency risk assessment also means public health measures to control the impact of the pandemic.
There is a small gap in the opportunity for countries to have the opportunity to further control their control efforts to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and reduce the pressure on healthcare.
Failure to do so may mean that medical systems in some EU/EEA countries will face a large number of patients who will need emergency care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 Coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has currently killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.
Similar to its similar virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted from mosquitoes and cause similar symptoms in the same way.
However, COVID-19 is more serious and deadly than SARS but is more contagious and affects more adults than young and more men than women.
As a response to the rapidly growing number of publications about an emerging disease, this article seeks to provide timely and detailed updates on a rapidly advancing research topic.
We will discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, cause, and prevention of disease.
While many questions still need answers, we hope that this revision will help us to understand and eliminate a threatening disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 has become an unforgettable and memorable memory for all Chinese who were encouraged to stay in their homes for the holidays and for weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of the new virus.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (Cov) that caused the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); as a result, it was renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the related disease was named as theCoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to some 50 other places around the world.
On March 2, 2020, the virus led to more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being discharged from the hospital and more than 3,000 patients dying.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the most serious public enemy and may be more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published about COVID-19 including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020 that determined the sequence of the virus divided into multiple patients.
This review seeks to summarize the progress of research on a new and rapidly advancing topic.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by theCoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, 2012 outbreak).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about prevention and the cause of the disease and other important questions that remain.
CoVs are generally considered non-fatal pathogens in humans, primarily responsible for 15% of common cold 4.
However, in this century, we have faced two highly pathogenic humanCoVs, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused epidemics that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and quickly spread to other countries causing serious illness and death.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of theCoV in recorded human history.
As shown in Death. Death.1,1, sets of pneumonia with unknown origin were first reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later a sequence of theCoV was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death was reported in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread quickly to neighboring cities, states, and countries.
On January 20, infections were reported among health workers, suggesting that human contagion was a possibility.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was shut down and all public transportation was suspended.
On January 24 a preliminary medical study of the disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed conditions, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market that was considered to be the site of the original unknown animal-borne disease.
On January 30, the WHO declared a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and to some 50 countries worldwide (Death.
As the situation changes rapidly, the outcome and severity of the epidemic are unknown.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-institutional survey of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients showed a more updated picture of the pandemic in the following way (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has affected people of all ages, but mainly 30-65 years of age.
About half (47.7%) of the sick were over 50, a few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 grew in clusters primarily in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average period of confinement was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average time from the beginning to death is 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic number for recycling (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the modified R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people rose rapidly before 23 Jan. 2020, which coincided with the time of mass transportation before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed conditions was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are part of a large family of hidden viruses that contain a single strand of sensory RNA.
They can be divided into four categories, namely, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, i.e. alpha and beta cows are known to infect humans.
The spike (S) of the glycoprotein envelope binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) cell receptors of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The bacterial RNA gene is released from the cytoplasm; after the replication of the bacterial gene, the gene RNA associated with the glycoprotein envelope and nucleocapsid proteins forms vesicles containing the virion, which binds to the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 gene sequence was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new beta-CoV variant with 99.98% genetic identification among 10 consecutive samples collected at the first breeding site, Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is generally more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Using electron transfer microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in highly exposed areas of the airway epithelium in humans.
Human ACE2 was found to be a response to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 much faster than that of SARS-CoV, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less serious infections in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also reconstitute a new short protein produced byorf3b and a derived protein produced byorf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and may inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 does not contain any known active motif or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the cryo-EM structure of ACE2 in humans with a full length at a specificity of 2.9 Å associated with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
It was found that these binders, with open and closed structures, were synthesized as dimers and the ACE2-B0AT1 binders were able to synthesize two S proteins, providing evidence for the detection of COVID-19 and infection.
B0AT1 may be a targeted treatment in drug testing to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and host medium
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in the larvae and were transmitted to humans by civet cats and camels, respectively.
In comparison to the phylogenetic of SARS-CoV-2 and otherCoVs, the larvae are recognized as the original host of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-likeCoVs from the larvae called SL-CoVZX45 for the larvae and SL-CoVZX21 for the larvae.
However, which host intervened to help the virus cross the intergenic boundary to infect humans is unknown, and the route of transmission remains to be clarified.
Ji, et al., suggested that snakes may be carriers of viruses from mosquitoes to humans that involved the rejuvenation of similar traits within the S protein.
According to the study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggest that pangolins - long-nosed, rodent-eating mammals commonly used as traditional Chinese medicine - may be the median host for SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic characteristics in theCoV derived from pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% spread difference between the two genes makes a big difference; therefore, the confirmed results of strong female are yet to be seen (Deut.
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 to a large extent are not known at this time.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive without the organism for up to 48 hours in dry conditions and up to 5 days under 20 °C and 40%-50% radiation.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be resistant to ultraviolet radiation and 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can cause the virus to become ineffective.
In general, all humans lack immune systems that are immune to SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore at risk of contracting the new virus.
At present, no detailed studies have been reported on immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to past studies of other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Death. (Death.4).
Generally, after the virus has invaded the body, the host's natural immune system is first detected by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that include receptors such as lectin type C, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-like receptor of I (RLR).
In different ways, the virus causes inflammatory symptoms, dendritic cell formation, and the production of interferon type I (IFN) inhibitors that inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of the virus's antigens.
However, the N-protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus to escape immune response.
Soon, a flexible immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes that bind CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in protecting.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific immune systems, and CD8+ T cells directly kill infected cells.
Auxiliary T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to aid immune cells.
However, theCoV can inhibit T cell activity by producing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity including such aids as C3a and C5a and immune systems are also essential in fighting viral infection.
For example, immunosuppressants taken from a recovered patient inhibit the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system creates a large number of radicals in the area that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst case, multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2, which has a group-like origin, is more likely to infect adults with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have compromised immune function to be more likely to become infected than other people.
The average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14, in most cases 3-7 days based on an initial study of 425 people in Wuhan.
However, a survey of 1,099 people showed that the incubation period was an average of 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as described above, showed that the shelter period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on the experience of 8,866 people.
It is of utmost importance for health authorities to change the lockdown time based on the correct coverage period, thereby preventing infected but symptom-free people from passing the virus on to others.
As is common practice, people exposed, or infected, are required to be locked away for 14 days.
Should the period of confinement be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the primary and primary symptom of COVID-19, which may not be accompanied by symptoms or other symptoms such as coughing-free coughing, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and diarrhea.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia within a week of the onset of the disease.
In critical cases, patients progressed rapidly and developed severe respiratory illness, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even if no unusual symptoms are seen in the pulmonary imaging, should be screened for the initial diagnosis.
A population data survey conducted at the end of December 2019 showed a percentage of symptoms that were 98% fever, 76% no cough, 55% dyspnea, and 3% diarrhea; 8% needed machine breathing.
Similar findings were reported in two recent family group and symptomatic group studies.
In comparison, a 2012 human data survey showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), no-coughing cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed machine breathing, which is much more than patients with COVID-19 and corresponds to a higher rate of MERS death than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), cough-free cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were shown to be major symptoms and ventilation was needed in about 14%-20% of patients.
On February 14, deaths from COVID-19 were 2 percent when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
In comparison, deaths from SARS in November 2002 accounted for 10 percent of all 8,096 confirmed cases.
According to MERS, based on a survey of population data in June 2012, 37 percent of confirmed cases were deaths of 2,494 people.
The initial study reported that the R0 for SARS-CoV-2 was higher at 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 for SARS-CoV had a range from 2 to 4.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of their symptoms, mortality, and R0 are represented in Table Table1.1.
The above numbers suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher potential for transmission than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but has less lethal potential than both.
Therefore, it is more challenging to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The start of groups often takes place in the same family or circle or in a transportation object such as a recreational boat.
Patients usually have a history of visiting or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or having contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks before the start.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks and that patients who have been cured and released from the hospital can carry the virus again, which gives a warning to extend the isolation period.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of < 4×109/L including a lymphocyte count of < 1×109/L, and high levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were found in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were high in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were high in the blood of many patients.
In patients with severe disease, the level of D-dimer, the breakdown of fibrin in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes was significantly reduced.
A rare finding was in chest radiography of many COVID-19 patients and features of double-sided shadow or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often suffer from unusual pneumonia, severe lung damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid growth, and progressive fibrosis endanger gas exchange.
Type I and type II pneumocyte dysfunction reduces the level of the surfactant and increases the pressure of the surface area, thus reducing the lung's ability to expand and increasing the risk of lung failure.
Thus, the most serious effects of radiography are often the same as the most serious disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed pneumocyte proliferation, hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial lymphocyte access, as well as multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of the disease-dead patient, which is associated with viral disease pathology and ARDS and similar to that of SARS and MERS patients.
The discovery of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as a key basis for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to the high number of false positives, which could speed up the epidemic, medical visibility was first used in the diagnosis (which was not dependent on RT-PCR alone) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation arose in the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, medical demonstrations, laboratory tests, and radiological results is important and critical to a successful diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's team described a protocol to use the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK method to detect SARS-CoV-2, detecting non-organic RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a lubrication rod in less than an hour without requiring complex tools.
We hope that the new method will greatly improve sensitivity and benefits if confirmed in medical samples.
Due to a lack of experience with the newCoV, doctors can primarily provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while attempting a variety of previously used or proposed treatments to treat otherCoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table (Table2).2).
This treatment includes current and potential treatments with antibiotics, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
It is even suggested that patients who recover from the disease use plasma as a treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to develop immunoassays and antibacterial targets.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and is likely to also attack, to a lesser extent, other body organs that exhibit ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, malfunction and respiratory failure are a major threat to patients and a major cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives and includes regular oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, ventilation without injuries, and ventilation using injuries depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary surgery used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and septic shock, as well as protection of vital organ function are also important for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that cytokine thunderstorms are the result of an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
The cytokine cyst is a reaction of the inflammatory system with release characteristics of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines stimulate the immune system to release large amounts of free radicals that are the primary cause of ARDS and the failure of many organs.
Immunosuppression is essential in treating cytokine storms, especially in critically ill patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 immune system, have been used to treat cytokine thunderstorms.
Other treatments for cytokine-related immune suppression include control of T-cell-directed immune response; inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK suppression; blinatumomab; cytokine signal-activation suppressor 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, are widely used to treat SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids did not benefit from serious lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Rather, it can cause serious adverse effects, especially vascular osteonecrosis, which significantly impairs prognosis.
However, a short-term course of low- to moderate-dose corticosteroids has been recommended for careful use in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antibacterial treatment had been confirmed.
However, remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antibiotic first developed by Gilead to treat Ebola and Marlburg-caused viral diseases.
Later, remdesivir also showed that it could inhibit single-stranded RNA bacteria including MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead has provided China with a supplement to conduct research on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, andribavirin have been proposed as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, diarrhoea, liver damage, and other serious reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this treatment with other medicines used in patients should be carefully observed.
Plasma from recovered patients and immune system development
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from a communicable disease for the treatment of other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy people from infection has a long history.
In fact, recovered patients often have a high level of immune system.
The immune system is an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight disease and other unnecessary substances and to detect and inhibit disease cells.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients recovering from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by a reduced inflammation and improved viral levels and oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, confirmation and clarification are needed to suggest that a method be widely used before any particular treatment is developed.
Furthermore, given the effects of treatment, other plasma-related disadvantages should be carefully considered.
For example, immune systems can excessively stimulate immune responses and cause cytokine release, which can be life-threatening.
The immune system in the blood is generally low, and the need for plasma is high enough to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to build and produce immunity quickly enough to fight a global pandemic.
Hence, it is very important and reasonable to isolate B cells from patients who have recovered and to mark the genetic codes that have the active genes or to filter out the immune systems that are active in representing the vital proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can increase the production of immune systems.
TCM has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend largely on the combination of many components in different formulations depending on diagnosis based on the TCM view.
Most functional parts remain unknown or unclear as it is difficult to identify and verify the best functioning of such parts or compounds.
Meanwhile, due to the lack of effective and direct treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms in those who recover from critical stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen pills were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
High rates of treatment for COVID-19 patients were noted in many Chinese provinces that used TCM for 87 percent of their patients, including Gansu (63.7 percent), Ningxia (50 percent), and Hunan (50 percent), while Hubei province, which used TCM for about 30 percent of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13 percent).
However, this is an inaccurate comparison since other factors such as the number and severity of patients should be included in the analysis.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) alone with combined WM and TCM treatment.
They found that the time needed for body temperature to recover, for symptoms to disappear, and for hospitalization was shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most strikingly, the rate of symptomatic decline (from minor to critical) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than only the WM group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the WM+TCM group than only the WM group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of TCM are still waiting for well-controlled studies at large levels and in many institutions.
It may also be interesting to note the course of action and to clarify the active components of the treatment of TCM or its combinations where possible.
Patients who are suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 are often more afraid of the highly contagious and deadly disease, and people who are isolated become more irritable, lonely, and angry.
In addition, infectious symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, and cough and serious medical consequences such as corticosteroid insomnia can lead to increased anxiety and mental distress.
In the early stages of SARS's demise, many mental illnesses including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, impaired mental function, signs of insanity, seizures, and even suicidal thoughts were reported.
The monitoring of forced contact and isolation, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, may cause many people to feel anxious and guilty about the consequences of contagion, isolation, and discrimination on their families and friends.
As a result, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected patients, and those they contact and the general public who need it.
Mental health assistance should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and treatment plans and the use of electronic medical devices and strategies to avoid close contact with others.
Practical policies are essential to break the chain of transmission from infected animals and humans to potentially infected hosts and are generally consistent with antibiotics in the control of epidemics caused by new viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines to develop long-term and lethal immunity and/or immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live off-the-shelf targets have been tested on animals for SARS.
However, the biological efficacy of these target candidates in adults and models of lethal challenge and their protection against animal-to-human transmission of the virus are yet to be determined before clinical research can begin.
This is because SARS was silenced 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, rare cases and MERS clusters continue to emerge from the Middle East and spread to other regions because of persistent sources of bacteria from animals to humans in infected areas.
Vaccination techniques have been developed for MERS using inactive bacteria, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, bacterial-like particles and subunits of the protein complex and some have been tested on animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in infected people is an urgent and critical task in the ongoing pandemic control.
However, resistance to the challenges is challenging because of the long time (average 18 months) needed to develop a vaccine and mutate variants of theCoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to demonstrate its full medical program to thousands of patients.
In many cases, patients may recover slowly without the effects of previous illness.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with a high rate of illness and death among patients with serious illnesses.
Therefore, building a model of the cause of the disease is essential for healthcare agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the cause of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in the cause of SARS, which is also true of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly appeared between the ages of 30-65, and 47.7% of those patients were over 50 in the 8,866 patients survey as described above.
Patients who needed emergency care were more likely to contract other diseases and complications and were significantly older than those without (age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a factor in the impact on COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Preexisting and complex diseases: Patients with COVID-19 who require critical care are more likely to suffer serious heart attacks and arrhythmia.
Heart-related events were also the leading cause of death among SARS patients.
It has also been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is also able to bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19-positive patients.
It is good to note that age and already existing illness are closely related and may interfere with each other.
Unusual laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or a tumor injury and has been suggested as a possible cause of disease, response to treatment, and complete recovery.
It also links CRP levels to the severity of the cause of COVID-19.
In addition, high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely expressed in many organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released during a tumor.
As a result, they are common indicators of heart or liver failure.
Major medical symptoms: Chest radiography and short-term continuation of symptoms should be considered along with other predictive complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As mentioned above, immunosuppressant steroids are often used as an additional treatment for a number of infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
With the widespread use of high doses of corticosteroids in patients with severe SARS, most survivors had a vascular osteonecrosis with a lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short period of time for COVID-19 patients.
Mental depression: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients suffered from severe depression as they had to endure long periods of confinement and extreme uncertainty and witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
It is important that counseling and long-term support be provided to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal health.
According to human data studies to date, COVID-19 appears to have epidemiological features distinct from SARS.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 is able to easily replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause minor or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, in the same way that common cold-causing coVs.
Thus, infected patients in the first stage or in the covert phase can produce a large amount of the virus during daily activities, causing great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV infection was thought to occur when patients were very ill, while most infections did not occur in the first stage.
As a result, the outbreak of COVID-19 is more serious and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
There are several ongoing efforts currently underway in China including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the ongoing lockdown of the entire population in the hope of disrupting SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
While these measures have caused severe damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the pace of the epidemic.
The most promising estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and the decline phase will continue for 3-4 months.
However, some scholars do not have that hope.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, will not end by 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
The Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both mid-turbinate and throat swabs of patients who recovered and left the hospital two weeks earlier, suggesting that the newly detected virus may be a flu-like recurrent strain.
However, promising signs have emerged in China based on the declining number of young patients, suggesting that current techniques may be effective.
Initially, it was predicted that Ebola would infect a million people and kill half a million people.
However, due to strict isolation and isolation, the disease is finally under control.
It is possible, like SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 may become weak and weak and eventually extinct or become a highly pathogenic virus capable of living in humans.
Comparisons of the COVID-19 epidemic with those of SARS and MERS are given below (Death. (Death.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is most commonly transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with infectious agents.
The virus was also found in the mouth, opening up a new way of transmission from the mouth to the mouth.
A recent survey of 138 patients reported that 41 percent of patients may have been infected in hospitals, including 17 patients who had previously suffered from other diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, extreme caution should be exercised to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, coworkers, and even those who are standing near patients or infected people.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear face masks; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series # 1860s) help control the spread of bacteria.
Surgical face masks are fluid from an infected person that prevents the air from moving and adheres to the surface of objects, where it can be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (series # 1860s) can protect you from sniffing small virions at 10 to 80 nm, while only 5% of virions can pass completely; SARS-CoV-2 has the same size as SARS-CoV both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can pass through five combined surgical masks, healthcare providers who work directly with patients must wear N95 masks (series # 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers must wear adequate protective gowns to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can be transmitted through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body by entering his swollen eyes.
As a result, health care providers should also wear face protectors or glasses while working with patients.
In the general community in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with soap more often than usual, try to stay indoors to lock themselves out and limit contact with people who may be infected.
A three-step distance is considered a reasonable distance for people to stay away from patients.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, its similar structure to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 was to serve as a warning to China as it was still recalling the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control assured the residents that the new virus has little transmission and little reproduction from person to person and that it is not a problem to prevent and control the disease.
The message made the public uncomfortable, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and they missed a critical time of controlling the virus before it spread in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies may learn from this critical lesson and make important progress in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more careful when making public announcements as each name is important to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from the clinic than to authorized reports from doctors or officials; (3) prevent more to control potential epidemics while still in their early stages than to try to comfort the public; and (4) conduct more direct and effective drills to improve public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve the public response system from time to time.
COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to some 50 other countries around the world at the time of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar and between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has created a feeling that SARS is recurring.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important for controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects more older people than younger and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate is higher among adults than among youths.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while patients with SARS transmit it after severe illness, which causes even greater difficulty in controlling the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA analysis of SARS-CoV-2 may be positive for some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have been cured may also show a positive result when tested for the virus.
This finding greatly increases the risk of the virus spreading.
With rapid progress in COVID-19 research, there are still a few critical problems that need to be addressed, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although it found that there is a 96% genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like ant-like coVs, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is derived from ants.
What midlife animal transmitted the virus from the original host, say the locust, to humans?
If we do not know the answers to # 1 and 2, we cannot successfully stop the transmission, and the outbreak can get worse at any time.
Although cellular models and biochemical analysis have shown that SARS-CoV-2 adheres to ACE2, how does the virus actually enter the respiratory tract cells and cause the resulting disease-causing changes?
Does the virus also attach itself to cells that display ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot have access to a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the plague last?
How do the genes of the virus change during human contagion?
Will it be a global epidemic, will it end like SARS or will it get worse from time to time like the flu?
It is important, but it may take time to search for answers to the above questions and many others.
However, no matter how much it costs, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as quickly as possible and restore our lives to normal.
The origins of the human coronavirus from animals to humans
Change and adaptation have encouraged the co-evolution of coronavirus (CoVs) and their host, including humans, for millennia.
Prior to 2003, two human cows (HCoVs) were known to cause minor illness, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed the situation to show how much damage and life-threatening HCoV disease can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 also put the covs in the theater and surprised us with high infection but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs can help.
Most HCoVs originate from mosquitoes and do not cause disease to them.
The median hosts of other HCoVs are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications for preventing human diseases.
Researching host interactions of theCoV in animals may reveal important insights into the formation of theCoV in humans.
In this review, we present a summary of the existing knowledge about seven HCoVs, and will focus on their discovery history and zoonotic origins and the transmission of various organisms.
More importantly, we compare and classify different HCoVs from the perspective of viral mutations and genetic synthesis.
The current outbreak of the 2019 COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for effective host change and the effects of viral transition to disease-critical are also highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoVs) are part of the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of closed, opository, single-stranded RNA-like bacteria.
These bacteria contain the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases among RNA bacteria called ama-CoV because of their crown-like morphology under an electron microscope.
Structurally, the cows have non-particulate genomes with similar order.
About three parts of the genome have two large open reading frames that are interlocked (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into replicase polyproteins of pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are further processed to form 16 extra unstructured proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains structural ORF proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
The number of list-specific protein assays also contains the code for various lists of CoVs.
Based on protein sequence differences, the coVs are classified into four categories (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), where the beta-CoV category contains the majority of HCoVs and is divided into four categories (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that algae and mice are the source of the genes for alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the source of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have been steadily breaking the boundaries of living organisms and many of them have become important pathogens for humans.
To date, seven human cov (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause minor symptoms, such as common cold and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, the newly discovered SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 cause serious illness, causing severe lower respiratory tract disease in the vast majority of patients causing a higher risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other non-pulmonary diseases.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nostrils of patients with a common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information has been obtained about detailed studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause autoimmune symptoms.
In fact, the idea that HCoVs are generally harmless was accepted until the SARS outbreak.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is one of the most tragic in modern history, infecting more than 8,000 people and resulting in nearly 10 percent of deaths.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with occasional outbreaks in other parts of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), which killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people on March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been sounding and the world must be prepared for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origins from mosquitoes, mice or pets.
Much evidence supports the origin of all HCoVs from mosquitoes, where the bacteria adapted well to the environment and did not cause disease but showed a lot of genetic variation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed major challenges to medicine, science, society, and ethics in China and around the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, dynamics and inhibitory features of the jump of organisms.
This may also guide or assist in the investigation of the cause, median and reproduction of host animal copies of SARS-CoV-2, which will have significant implications for preventing future transmission.
In this review we present a summary of zoonotic origins, transgenicity and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the same theme that the parent viruses of HCoVs usually do not cause disease in their natural host but cause disease after the various organisms have been infected with the new host.
We also reviewed the evolutionary trend of HCoVs where an increase in infection often comes with a decrease in pathogenicity.
The effects of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are also discussed in this context.
AnimalCoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first classification of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the nostrils of patients who had received a common cold, differentCoVs were classified from infected animals of various species, including garlic, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV detections in sequence (Table 1) may be useful and informative.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract disease in 1966, and was approved for growth in the WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had common cold symptoms, including headache, dizziness, malaise and sore throat, and fever and cough were observed in 10~20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 separated from the spleen and subsequent chain of ducts in the brains of sucking mice.
The treatment features of HCoV-OC43 disease appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which was not characteristically differentiated from infection with other respiratory tract diseases such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread globally, and are commonly transmitted during the winter season in favorable weather conditions.
The incubation period of these two viruses is usually less than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
According to a human volunteer study, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E experienced a mild common cold.
Only a few patients with a depressed immune system showed a serious respiratory tract disease.
SARS, also known as rare pneumonia, was the first HCoV-induced outbreak recorded in human history and is the causative agent of SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first SARS-related disease can be traced back to the end of 2002 in China's Guangdong Province.
The SARS epidemic resulted in a reported 8,096 cases and 774 deaths, spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from the main pathogens, it was estimated that each case could cause at least two more cases, with a shelter period of 4 to 7 days and the peak of the virus dose appeared on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially were diagnosed with myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and fever, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as recent symptoms.
Lymphopenia, liver dysfunction tests, and high creatine kinase are among the rare laboratory symptoms commonly associated with SARS.
Spread alveolar damage, epithelial cell swelling, and growth of macrophages have been noted in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require critical care and ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, many organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys can also become infected with these serious conditions, often accompanied by cytokine cyclones, which can be especially lethal to patients with compromised immune systems.
The virus was first isolated in the open lung surgery of the first relative of the patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, major efforts have been made in relation to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was first found to be common in young children, older people, and at-risk respiratory disease patients.
Coryza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common in HCoV-NL63 disease.
One independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal cavity of an eight-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was discovered in the Netherlands, it has in fact spread worldwide.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7% of the common respiratory infections, and its peak incidence occurs in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to the common pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute asthmatic exacerbation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing minor respiratory illnesses.
All of these community-acquired HCoVs are well adapted to humans and generally have a low chance of mutating into highly pathogenic diseases, although the risks occur for unknown reasons such as in the rare and deadly subtype HCoV-NL63, which is reported to cause a serious respiratory tract infection in China.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to easily infect and maintain themselves in a continuous state within humans, they also kill or become slightly pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient suffering from severe pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the confirmed cases in the laboratory are from the Middle East, the imported cases are spread to nearby contacts reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
A second outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The medical appearance of MERS is similar to that of SARS, which is characterized by progressive severe pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS were treated for severe kidney failure, which is currently a distinct MERS among HCoV-induced diseases.
More than 30 percent of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and diarrhea.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases were reported in the laboratory with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most dangerous viruses in humans.
From mid-December 2019 to late 2019, a number of patients with pneumonia known to be related to SARS-CoV-2 disease were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization called the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 respiratory tract disease a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of 3.4%.
Notably, the death rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the other one outside is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes a serious respiratory illness such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which has been introduced as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Patients are also treated for diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are almost identical due to the same composition of the 82% high nucleotide sequence, there are different groups in the branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be slightly pathogenic but is more intertwined compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
There are reportedly no symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 and may be influenced by its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparing and differentiating SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveals some very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the coverage period and the duration of the HCoV disease progression are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the common trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits common symptoms during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including the absence of clear symptoms, mild symptoms or absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of COVID-19 critical cases can also be seen as in the SARS-CoV case, although the rate is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 infection also demonstrates interesting patterns with characteristics of both community-based HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the other hand, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be confirmed whether transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases in humans as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Lastly, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in wild samples.
Whether or not oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a significant role in SARS-CoV under certain conditions remains to be clarified by future research.
It is also very interesting to see whether SARS-CoV-2 will show a seasonal evolution as is the case with publicly available HCoVs.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including its infectiousness, pathogenicity and sustained spread after human transmission will have an impact on the final outcome of the ongoing spread of COVID-19.
All HCoVs found in the community cause minor symptoms and adapt well to humans.
According to one theory, it may also be true that humans adapt well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived the ancient HCoV outbreak.
HCoVs cause serious infections in humans and people infected with serious HCoVs are no longer present.
To achieve this, HCoVs must replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the growth of adaptive mutations that contradict the host restriction characteristics.
In this way, if the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and infects more people, there will be a greater chance that it will adapt more closely to humans.
If it adapts well enough, it can be difficult to prevent human transmission by isolation or other means of controlling infection.
For many years, four cows have been found in communities circulating in human communities, causing a common cold in people with a normal immune response.
These viruses do not need an animal source.
In contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well adapted to humans and their transmission within humans cannot be maintained.
They need to keep themselves in shape and grow in their zoonotic source and seek the opportunity to move on to potentially vulnerable victims, perhaps by one or more average hosts and foster hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs.
It is as contagious as HCoVs found in the community, at least in the original species.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and has less pathogenicity to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and orbit without a source or host of the central animal.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will be helpful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the mutant, natural, source, intermediate and growth hosts of HCoVs.
An animal becomes a host of HCoV mutations if it contains a closely related ancestor with which it shares a higher homology in the nucleotide sequence.
The pathogen usually adapts well and does not cause disease to the host.
Similarly, the host source is continuously and for a long time exposing HCoV.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and are natural hosts of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV is reintroduced to the intermediate host earlier or by introduction to humans, it does not adapt well to the new host and often causes disease.
This intermediate host may be a zoonotic source of human infection and play a role in breeding the host that allows the virus to be repeated for a while and transmitted to humans to increase the rate of human infection.
HCoV can survive the last infection if it cannot maintain its infection within the central host.
In contrast, HCoVs are able to adapt to the medium host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the average host becomes a natural source host.
Epidemiological data showed that when a patient with SARS was examined backward, he had a history of contact with predators.
Subsequent seroprevalence studies showed that animal traders had higher IgG against SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
Masked palm civet (paguma larvata) and racoon dog in the wildlife market were found to carry viruses similar to SARS-CoV that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no additional SARS was reported after the deaths of all civilians in the markets.
However, it has been reported that wild or farm-covered palm civets that have never been exposed to live animal markets were positive when it comes to SARS-CoV, suggesting that the masked palm civet may be a medium-breeding host but not a natural source of SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy, that 80% of the various animals in Guangzhou's market have anti-SARS-CoV immunity, we cannot ignore the possibility that many mammals are the average breeding host for SARS-CoV.
All of these appear to be the last hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent research of the host's natural SARS-CoV gene revealed a closely related animal-relatedCoV, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), found in Chinese horse-shoe-related algae.
These are the most potent mutants in terms of anti-SARS-CoV immunity and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 gene sequence.
This and other animal co-overs share 88-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have led to the emergence of a new idea that mosquitoes host new human pathogens.
SARS-like (SL-CoV) co-overs have been identified in mosquitoes, but none other than the so-called WIV1 have been classified as a living virus.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV response.
WIV1 from a molecule of larval feces was shown to use larva, civet, and human ACE2 as a response to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the serum of patients recovering from SARS was able to kill WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents a closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in moths, sharing 95% of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Although there is a high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the closest relative virus to SARS-CoV and that mosquitoes are the closest host to SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis includes MERS-CoV and the same group as theCoV-HKU4 and theCoV-HKU5 strains.
The animalCoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host response, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), in viral infection.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence of MERS-CoV is phylogenetically closely related to the beta-CoV counterparts of the animal found in Europe and Africa.
To date, no living MERS-CoV has been found in wild locusts.
MERS-CoV and its close relative animalCoV-HKU25 share only 87% of the nucleotide sequence homology.
As a result, mosquitoes may not be the immediate host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive to the MERS-CoV directly killing immunity, similar to camels from the Middle East in many African countries.
The human-derived viral-like MERS-CoV was isolated from a dromedary camel's nasal swab, which further demonstrated that camels are the true host source of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that usually small but large viral release was observed in camels infected with MERS-CoV according to the study.
It is noteworthy that infected camels not only release germs through the respiratory tract but also through the oral tract, which is also the main route of germ release from the mosquitoes.
However, questions remain as many MERS illnesses have no history of camel contact before symptoms begin, it is possible that human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission pathways involve unknown animals that contain MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with the animal RaTG13CoV that is differentiated from the Rhinoophus affinis mite.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence variance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to be assigned to parental relationships.
That said, mosquitoes may not be the nearest host source of SARS-CoV-2 unless near-identical animalCoVs are detected in the future.
It is believed that, the hosts of the average SARS-CoV-2 animal should be among wild animals sold and slaughtered at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, most of which were related to the early COVID-19 disease, suggesting that there may have been an animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may contain older SARS-CoV-related beta-CoVs.
These new pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 by a sequence identity of about 90% in the nucleotide sequence.
They are grouped into two sublists of nearly SARS-CoV-2-like bacteria in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a highly similar receptor domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, and a 97.4% amino acid sequence similarity.
In stark contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very different, although there is a high degree of broad genome homology sequence.
Previous research on diseased pangolins reported the detection of viral contigs in lung samples, which appear to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used a variety of structural and manual sequencing techniques to construct a partial genome sequence that comprises about 86.3% of the total length of the bacterial genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangolin is one of the closest host animals to SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support that pangolin is a direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-related pangolin SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-related pangolin SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in frogs, pangolins and other mammals is yet to be discovered.
Although higher sequence homology has been found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share higher genome sequence homology.
There are high suspicions that a high degree of similarity between beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2 pangolin RBDs and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selective interaction evolution.
Another proposal recommends a mid-range reintegration of beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2 pangolin and RaTG13 in a third wild animal.
As the forces driving evolution, recombination spread among beta-CoVs.
No conclusion has been reached regarding the near zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been investigated.
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from animalCoVs, while the pathogenic viruses are HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 derived from mice.
It has been reported that the animal-CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) derived from the North American tricolor animal showed a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another animalCoV, called Hipposideros/Ghana, discovered in Ghana, while chameleons have been suspected of being its nearest host.
For clarity, current information regarding known animal origins of HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of HCoV infection incidents in history.
While HCoV-OC43 was transmitted from another animal to humans from domestic animals around 1890, an outbreak of respiratory disease was recorded.
The history of the transmission of the HCoV-229E variant is not very clear.
Alpha-CoVs have been identified from the HCoV-229E-related animal.
Among them is the alpaca alpha-CoV.
Few evidence supports the direct transmission of the virus from the larvae to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, may have come into contact with ants in the same environment.
Rather, humans are close friends of alpacas.
Second, the animal alpha-CoVs associated with HCoV-229E are diverse and do not cause disease in the alpaca, while the alpaca alpha-CoV caused respiratory disease outbreaks in infected animals.
Lastly, alpha-CoV of alpaca has not yet been detected in wild animals.
As a result, we will not ignore the possibility that alpacas may have an alpha-CoV related to HCoV-229E in humans.
In fact, mosquitoes are a direct source of human diseases, including rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra.
It is therefore not surprising that mosquitoes may transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, when alpha-CoVs in animals act as a set of HCoV-229E genes, alpacas and dromedary camels may be the central host that transmits the virus to humans, as is the case with MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good example of the transmission of different organisms from mosquitoes to dromedary camels to humans.
The origin of MERS-CoV evolution from mosquitoes is known from its initial study and confirmed by subsequent findings.
Clearly, the ants provide a chance for a variety of bacteria to exchange genes between different animals and to spread infection to different animals.
Longevity, dense colonies, close social ties, and a powerful ability to fly are all good conditions for mosquitoes to be a good 'virus transmitter.'
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary camels for centuries.
It is well adapted to these camels that have evolved from a moderate host to a stable host and natural source.
MERS-CoV causes very little disease and has a low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its human transmission is a mistake and humans remain the final host of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be preserved.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, beta-CoVs of pangolins cause a lot of disease in pangolins.
It may be the final host of SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, similar to civets in the SARS-CoV case.
The limited probability of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans should be considered or not considered in future studies.
First, mosquitoes may be the host source of the SARS-CoV-2 related virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may play a similar role as ants through animal surgery or coal mining.
Second, pangolins may be the intermediate breeding host where the SARS-CoV-2 related virus has recently been introduced.
People are infected by surgery and eating hunting meat.
It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
An immunological study is needed in both domestic and wild animals.
Third, as mentioned above, reintegration and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third animal associated with both lobsters and pangolins.
The hunt for the animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
In addition to the various animal host species, there are three major aspects of the viral side that are important in making the coves transcend the biological boundaries.
First, their high rate of change in RNA repetition.
Compared to other single stranded RNA viruses, the rate of mutation rates of the CoVs can be considered  as low to  as high at a rate of ~10-4 mutations per year for each 2nd host, depending on the phase of coV adaptation in the new host.
CoVs have a fault-finding exoribonuclease, removal of which results in extreme mutations and decreased potency or inability to grow properly.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress the reproduction of theCoV by blocking this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising SARS-CoV-2 anti-agent to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rates of mutations in the covs are about a million higher than those of the hosts.
In addition, the rate of change is often high if the coVs are not properly coordinated with the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be low, suggesting a higher degree of human adaptation.
Considering that, it may already have been agreed with another host who is close to the people.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedary camels.
It is thought that it is almost unlikely that genetic changes could cause vaccines and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to become inactive immediately.
Second, the large RNA genome in the CoVs uses more flexibility in genome change in change and reintegration, thus increasing the possibility of co-evolution of different organisms, which is beneficial for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
This is supported by many different open reading frames and protein functions produced by the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, the cows always randomly change the samples during RNA replication in a different way selective-copying.
In a host that acts as a mixing vessel, mutations occur regularly during the transcription of theCoV RNA.
Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNAs may reconnect to form new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural reintegration has been found in both HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, and animalCoVs such as SL-CoV of the animal and batCoV-HKU9.
The interaction of the virus with the host in relation to infection
Besides the three bacterial factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the host's response is another major factor that influences the transmission of the species.
Here, reintegration of SARS-CoV is considered a common example, which showed evidence of positive selection among different species of infection.
Based on comparative analysis between isolated individuals and civet SARS-CoVs, it is thought that SARS-CoV is experiencing rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly through changes in S protein RBD.
In general, RBD in the S protein of theCoV interacts with the cell response and is strictly selective for the host's immune response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the 318 to 510 amino acid sequence of S1, which binds to human ACE2 and its coreceptors to enter the virus.
The SARS-CoV RBD is able to detect ACE2 responses of different animals, including lizard, civet, mouse and raccoon, allowing for the transmission of the virus to different creatures.
In fact, only six amino acid residues identified as distinct from human viral and civet isolation in RBD are found in the molecule that adheres to the reaction to react with the ACE2 reaction.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the rate of spike protein interaction with the human ACE2 response.
In other words, this change in two amino acids may be important in the transmission of the virus to humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular response as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein means that the S-protein interaction rate with ACE2 in humans may have changed.
In fact, cryo-EM research shows a higher rate of 10- to 20-fold folding of this fold than the human ACE2 and S-protein of SARS-CoV.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another coreceptor is needed for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different S-part.
There are other HCoV responses, such as the aminopeptidase N of HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid of HCoV-OC43.
They may also be considered a reason for the successful adaptation of the CoVs to humans after the transmission of different organisms from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular responses, the effect of the transmission of different organisms by HCoVs is also controlled by other organism dependence and limiting factors.
The differences in these host proteins between humans and hosts that are the natural source of HCoVs such as moths, dromedary camels and mice may cause a borderline of infection between different organisms.
HCoVs must take on proprietary dependence features and interfere with host's immune features in order to have successful organism transmission.
In this regard, cell lines in this vital area of interaction with the host virus are yet to be identified and marked.
A comprehensive non-biased genome screening of host dependence and SARS-CoV-2 control features using modern CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
New HCoV outbreaks: back to the beginning
Variations of animal cov provide a wide range of opportunities for the emergence of new hcovs.
In this sense, animal cows act as a collection of HCoV genes.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic reintegration also drive the evolution of HCoV and act as two important steps in the process.
For example, the discovery or loss of genes that encode a new protein has the potential to dramatically alter the phenotypes of a virus.
Among the SARS-CoV helper proteins, ORF8 is thought to be important in human adaptation, as SARS-CoV-related animal viruses are isolated but found to produce different ORF8 proteins.
The 29-nucleotide elimination feature of SARS-CoV was found in isolated species at the beginning of the human pandemic.
This removal divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a mutation that promotes the change of hosts.
Otherwise, SARS-CoV may have a history of reintegration into alpha and gamma co-CoVs, where a large number of low-level reintegration sites were found in RNA-dependent polymerase RNA.
Reintegration sites were also found in nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic experienced incidents of reintegration between different strains, occurring in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cases of reintegration have been noted in other HCoVs, where HCoVs reintegrate with other animalCoVs in their structureless genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to unintended changes in the germ genomes, which may result in the release of germs from the selective pressures used, such as those of the host's immune system.
An example of these results is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E, due to double nucleotide removal.
Although complete ORF4 was detected in animal and camel-related viruses of HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoVs indicate single nucleotide insertion, leading to frame changes.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also under pressure to select its source hosts.
There were no symptoms or only minor symptoms found when the mites were infected with theCoVs, indicating similar synchronicity between theCoVs and mites.
It seems that mosquitoes are well adapted to the C.V.V.s in terms of structure and function.
For example, interference with the use of inflammatory responses in mosquitoes easily reduces the pathology caused by theCoVs.
In addition, the activity of the natural killer cell in mosquitoes is suppressed by an increased stability of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer cell response and a low level of complex histocompatibility of the I-grade cells.
In addition, the high level of oxygen-reactive organisms (ROS) formed by the digestive function of high-level food of mosquitoes may affect both the suppression of the reproduction of theCoV and affect the error testing with exoribonuclease, thus providing selective pressure for the formation of the most pathogenic strains of bacteria when introduced to a new host.
The most pathogenic variants of theCoV may also mutate through reintegration, leading to the discovery of new proteins or protein properties of host synthesis.
As a result, it is not just luck that three new HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.
CoVs do not infect each other or cause minor symptoms to their host primates such as moths and camels.
They multiply quickly without stimulating a strong immune response.
Here are the secrets of why symptoms-free carriers are detected and what causes critical conditions in human illness.
Critical symptoms are primarily due to an overworked immune system and a cytocin storm where a strong immune response, lung damage, becomes more severe.
In contrast, for those who do not show symptoms, the immune response has been divided into two for the recurrence of theCoV.
The same immune response differentiation strategy may have beneficial effects in treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The interferon response is particularly strong in fleas.
As a result, the use of type I interferon at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the use of the NLP3 inflammasome in mosquitoes is not effective.
According to this hypothesis, blocking the NRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in treating COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 evolution follows the common theme of the evolution of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although beta-CoV of the rodent has been found to share 95% of the nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also rodentCoV that shares 96% of the nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other animals on the market have been found to contain viruses such as SARS-CoV, the nearest median hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs have been identified with a similar structure to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolins may be other intermediate hosts or beta-CoVs pangolins may be involved in the genetic components of the final variant of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by humans.
CoVs have returned to the theatre due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Research into cov on the larvae and other animals has significantly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal sources of cov in human transmission.
The widespread evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are of larval origin and are transmitted to humans by intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection is from human-to-human contact with the markets, closing the live animal markets and killing the markets could end the SARS epidemic.
With the same thinking, pangolins should be removed from organic markets to prevent zoonotic infections, given the discovery of multiple lists of beta-CoVs of pangolin closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how it is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals will be clarified in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary camels for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation and a major source of meat, honey, skin, and wool products for the local people.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to kill all camels to control MERS, as it is in the wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrence of MERS, a detailed approach should be used to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, in line with other disease control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge to cause the spread.
Zoonotic varieties of CoVs are circulating in the desert.
In particular, animal cows have a very diverse zoonotic potential.
There is a high probability that these zoonoticCoVs will mutate and regrow, resulting in new highly contagious and/or lethalCoVs in the future.
The practice of eating wild animals in some parts of China must be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With SARS, MERS and COVID-19 cases, there must be a better preparedness and response system.
In fact, many germs have been around for a long time.
They stay in their natural habitat until they have the opportunity to get out.
Although mosquitoes have many factors that promote the spread of bacteria, the chance of humans contacting mosquitoes and other wildlife can be reduced if humans are taught to avoid them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be helpful in preventing animal-to-human infection and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the best way to prevent zoonosis is to keep people away from the environment that is the natural source of zoonotic bacteria.
Few parts of the zoonotic origin puzzle of SARS-CoV-2 have yet to be discovered.
First, if mosquitoes transmit the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen to pangolins, it will be useful to see under what circumstances mosquitoes and pangolins cannot share environmental similarities.
Second, if mosquitoes play a direct role in human transmission, it must be determined how humans communicate with mosquitoes.
Third, if a mammal acts as a true median host, the way it interacts with various creatures, including humans, lizards, and pangolins should be clarified.
Finally, as many mammals including pets may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and infection research should be done.
If it may be a lizard, a pangolin or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses will be found in its natural host in the future.
Further research in this area will explain the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, and important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
A review of the diagnostic criteria for those who are suspected and confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 is required
On 6 February 2020, our team had published a quick advice guide for the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guide provided our experience and made an appropriate reference to combat the global pandemic.
However, the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is a new disease, our vigilance and understanding are increasing based on ongoing research and experience in treatment procedures; therefore, diagnostic and treatment techniques are constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment regarding our guide and provided a condition for the new identification of those suspected and confirmed that they are ill in accordance with the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus of 2019 (2019-nCoV) had caused an outbreak, now officially known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO referred to COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a quick response guide and published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has received much attention since its publication.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, and surveillance and knowledge about it is increasingly based on research and medical experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment techniques are continually being reviewed.
For example, the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, has produced seven volumes in which some significant changes have been made.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., who presented a simple suggestion of points based on their own experiences.
Their work adds new evidence to our guide and makes the epidemic a global reference.
We commend their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work needs to be reviewed in accordance with the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Seventh Edition of the Study) and recent research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected infection it is necessary to combine any one epidemiological historical factor and two medical indications for a comprehensive analysis, or it is necessary to meet three medical indications that do not have a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of visiting or staying in or around Wuhan city, or other communities where COVID-19 illness was reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (by positive nucleic acid testing); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in and around Wuhan city, or other communities where COVID-19 was reported in the first 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with multiple confirmed patients (two patients with fever and/or symptoms ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ within 2 weeks in office, home, classroom, classroom, and in-patient settings).
Medical manifestations: (1) fever and/ or respiratory symptoms; (2) symptoms of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count showing normal, decreased, or decreased lymphocyte count in the first stage.
A confirmed diagnosis should be based on a suspected disease with one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a complete genome sequence of the virus showing high homogeneity in known new coronavirus viruses; (3) a positive result of having a specific IgM and IgG immune system for SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a change in this specific IgG immune system for SARS-CoV-2 from a more aggressive to a more aggressive, or a tetra that grows at a rate of ≥4 times more severe than a virus.
We see that real-time PCR testing of nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood samples has been added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic blood sample detection was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020); and serological evidence was included in the seventh schedule.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to find a high-level rapid-diagnosis nucleic acid kit, along with respiratory tract samples including blood samples, which increased the detection of various tissues, and supported the delivery of a positive immune response under certain conditions.
Besides, there is further evidence that reminds us to be cautious of patients with rare and symptomless symptoms.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be revised, as it refers to a person without medical symptoms as having a low risk.
The scoring process also needs to be validated at work and in continuing medical studies.
Finally, we hope that more evidence is forthcoming and we ask readers to comment.
To diagnose suspected illness and confirmed illness, we recommend that new national guidelines be followed and followed in their home countries.
Our team will also review our guide to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily figure
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of days caused by a virus.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the reported number of cases is 114 and 33 recovered stay-at-home patients.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news forum, IEDCR director, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two were over the age of 60, two were between 51 and 60, and one was between 41 and 50.
He also said that two were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 an epidemic on March 11.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news source, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport Obaidul Quader said public transport will be closed longer than scheduled, until next Saturday.
The public transportation ban had begun on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods - medical supplies, fuel and food - is still allowed.
The first recorded case of COVID-19 in Bangladesh was on March 8, in two returnees from Italy and the wife of one of them.
By March 19, the three had recovered.
The number of SARS-CoV-2 cases exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths were associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
This happened on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus-related illness and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea said, as of Thursday, it is one of the few countries that has not been infected with the coronavirus.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours before 10 a.m. on April 4th, according to Central European Europe (0800 UTC).
In the United States, more than 244 thousand coronavirus-related illnesses have been recorded, with nearly 5,900 deaths associated.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there have been more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. on Wednesday from coronavirus infections.
Worldwide, countries have announced strong measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city's curfew until May 1.
Worldwide, President Vladimir Putin has announced that Russians will continue to be banned from working until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national emergency by 15 days; 215 votes were cast, 10 abstentions, and one against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the curfew of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to last a full day; previously, curfew was between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to use the curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has announced that the state will extend its stay-at-home policy until May 1.
Shops in Australia have lowered the limits on paper for small-scale purchases
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australian shopping malls Woolworths and Coles lowered their purchase limit for toilet paper so that one person would buy two and one package for each purchase in a store nationwide, respectively.
ALDI also introduces a one-pack limit, Monday.
These restrictions have been posted as messages at the exit, and on the store's Facebook pages.
Consumers kept buying bulk of them out of fear of COVID-19 if they were to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths again banned the purchase of toilet paper from those who were brought home for one pack per order.
These changes follow the previous four-pick limit on each purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
"Coles, in its March 8 news release, reported that with the four-pack limit set, ""many stores are still out of stock about an hour after their delivery"", and called the need ""unparalleled"", while ALDI, in its Facebook post on Tuesday, said ""unexpected"""."
"The sales have ""increased dramatically"" in the past week, according to a Woolworths spokesman".
Costco's Canberra store also cut the price to two cakes last week.
To address the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and announced increased deliveries, Woolworths ordered more stock, while ALDI made special Wednesday stock available as soon as possible.
Russell Zimmerman, chief executive of the Australian Retailers Association, said that traders are trying to raise stock, but local council's restrictions on the delivery time of trucks make matters more difficult.
He expects production costs to increase, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to the immediate release of the stock, some stores could not continue with Wednesday's special.
In a report for News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a marketing expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores fill up the stock every night.
He noted that a small paper is a heavy object, leading to a low number of stocks in terms of numbers, and, when finished, leaves a large space open, reinforcing the feeling of worship.
Coles and Woolworths have the view [that] if there were more items on shelves, if a product like small paper rolls and sanitiser could be [bought] and there were more, you would probably lessen the fear, says Russell Zimmerman according to ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said Wednesday they ran out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, the creator of Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, the creator of Sorbent, stressed that they work 24/7 to keep the product alive, according to a News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that some real estate dealers offered free paper to the first bidder at the Melbourne auction, when a few auctions were held because buyers had time off due to the long Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of the NT News, a daily Darwinist newspaper, included a nine-page appendix designed to be cut and used as a toilet paper.
Stores initially hesitated to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on March 3 when they said they had no plans to introduce any purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that some products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitary tablets, dried foods, laundry detergent, and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday night a British online supermarket called Ocado was seen cutting off the purchase of Andres toilet paper for two in a 12-dollar pack.
The World Health Organization calls COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak the coronavirus-caused disease SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
"Although the term ""epidemic"" refers to the extent to which the disease has spread, not to the extent to which specific examples are dangerous, WHO has shown concern about the need to drive governments to action:"
All countries can still change the course of the epidemic.
When countries investigate, test, treat, isolate, monitor and respond by controlling human movements, says Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
We are deeply concerned about both the scattering and the difficulty of the spread and the lack of movement at the alarming levels.
"According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the epidemic is ""unprecedented"".""
"He said, in a commentary announced on CNN in February, ""except for the flu, no other respiratory virus has been traced from its appearance to its global spread".""
"Ghebreyesus has expressed the same view, saying ""we have never seen a coronavirus-removed epidemic before"".
"He went on, ""and we've never seen an epidemic that can be controlled at the same time"."""
The new pandemic situation follows WHO's decision in January to call the outbreak a global public health emergency.
"The director of the United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, ""the rest, it will get worse".""
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there have been at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 201920 coronavirus pandemic is a continuing outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a State of Emergency for Public Health in All Countries of Concern on 30 January 2020, and was declared an epidemic on 11 March 2020.
Since April 10, 2020, 1.61 million accurate cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and borders, leading to 97,000 confident deaths.
Some 364,000 people have recovered.
The number of extinct examples has been estimated at 4% in China, while the global figure has gone from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Problems may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time period from exposure to symptoms is usually five days, but it can drop from two to fourteen.
There is no known cure or treatment that can defeat the virus.
The main treatment approach is to look at the symptoms and provide helpful care. The recommended precautions include washing hands, covering your mouth when coughing, keeping distance from others, and keeping yourself safe and isolated from people who suspect they may be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by setting travel restrictions, segregation, movement times, risk management measures in workplaces, and closures.
The pandemic has led to severe economic and social upheavals worldwide, delayed or cancelled sporting, religious, political, and cultural events, and widespread shortages of urgent necessities.
Schools, including the bastions, have been closed nationwide or in 193 countries, affecting 99.4 percent of the world's students.
Misinformation about the virus has spread on the Internet, and there have been cases of racism and racial discrimination against Chinese, other Easterners and ethnic and social groups in North Asian countries, and others from countries with many cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced traffic and the closure of large industries, there has been a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a series of pneumonia cases of unknown origin on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was opened in early January 2020.
Many examples have been related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market so the virus is thought to have originated from animal transmission.
The virus that caused the outbreak was known as SARS-CoV-2, an emerging virus closely related to the animal coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The first known person to show symptoms was later diagnosed to have started to get sick on 1 December 2019, and that person never had a clear link to the wet market chain.
In the first set of samples reported in December 2019, three components were found to link to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the sample tracing back to 17 November 2019, of a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province, may be the first. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that, as new cases are reported to be declining in China but increasing rapidly in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China has now exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be reports under examples, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, small cases had been reported among young people, those aged 19 and under making up 2.4% of the world's cases.The chief scientific adviser from the United Kingdom, Patrick Vallance, suggested that 60% of the British population would need to be infected in order to achieve effective herd immunity.
The examples refer to the number of people tested for COVID-19, and their testing confirms the validity of the legal process.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had laws that prohibited testing of those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, up to January 23, an average of 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and this undocumented infection is the source of 79% of the recorded cases of the disease.
An analysis of statistics published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy is much higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the low birth rate (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it may be 5.7.
Many people with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who do not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, most often 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, at least 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of the deaths were over 60, and 75% already have pre-existing health problems including heart disease and diabetes.
The true death toll from COVID-19 may be very high, as it does not include all those who die without testing - e.g. at home, in a nursing home, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of over-deaths during the pandemic was 4-5 times higher than the official deaths from COVID.
"A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged ""We know that [the published death toll] is relatively low"", a statement that corresponds to anecdotal countdown reports in the U.S. Such low estimates are common in epidemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020".
The first death outside China itself occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
On February 28, apart from China itself, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by location and over time, and are influenced by the size of the study, the state of the health care system, the types of treatment, the time since the outbreak began, and social factors such as age, sex, and overall health.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies by location.
In China, the death-to-case ratio dropped from 17.3% (for those with symptoms that appeared on 1110 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms that appeared on 1 February 2020). Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which indicates the percentage of people tested who die from disease, and infection fatality rate (IFR), which indicates the percentage of infected (tested and untested) who die from disease.
These figures are not time-based and follow the number of individuals from infection to sample solution.
A number of scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall infection fatality rate of the epidemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The high estimates of this grade are consistent with results from random COVID-19 testing in Germany, and statistical studies analyzing the results of CFR-estimated tests.
The WHO insists that the epidemic can be controlled.
The exact time and length of the outbreak is not certain and may vary by location.
"Maciej Boni of Penn State University said, ""If left unattended, the outbreaks slowly start to develop and begin to decrease when the disease is out of reach of caregivers".
"But it is almost impossible to make any speculation at this time about when that will happen".
"China's top medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said ""it may be over by June"" if all countries can take action to follow WHO's advn measures to curb the spread of the virus".
"On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine spoke that SARS-CoV-2 ""will be circulating, with a strong one or two years""."
"According to a study by the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical isolation and other measures will be needed ""until a cure is found (by bathing for 18 months or more) ""."
"William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, ""I think it's unlikely that the coronavirus because it's easily transmitted will disappear forever"" could also ""become a seasonal disease, recurring every year"""."
The return of the flock will depend on the flock's strong protection and the degree of adaptation
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be indirect and infected people may not have any symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, a buildup of plaque and a phlegm, loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, dizziness, cold, dizziness, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a list of emergency symptoms such as shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or stress, dizziness, difficulty waking up, and gray face or lips; immediate medical attention is encouraged if these symptoms are present.
Some of those infected may not have any symptoms, no medical symptoms, but their test results confirm infection, so researchers have advised that those who had close contact with those confirmed should be closely monitored and monitored to ensure that the disease is not present.
China's estimate of the symptomless ratio ranges from a few to 44%.
The average warm-up period (the period between infection and symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days. To give an example of uncertainty, the estimated proportion of people with COVID-19 who lose their sense of smell was initially 30% and later dropped to 15%.
More details of how the disease has spread are still being discussed in modern times.
The disease is believed to spread primarily during close contact with small droplets formed when coughing, sneezing, or talking; when close contact is about 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 shoulders).
Studies have found that uncovered coughing can cause drops to travel up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some suggest that the virus may be transmitted through tiny droplets that stay longer in the air, which can occur during speech.
The droplets may lie on the feet or nostrils of nearby people or may be drawn into the lungs.
Other procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory failure to become heated and result in air pollution.
It can also spread when someone touches the infected area, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there is concern that it may increase rapidly, the risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection by mouth contact after contact with the stool. The virus is at high risk of infection during the first three days of symptoms although spread may occur before symptoms appear and in the final stages of the disease.
People have been tested for the virus up to three days before symptoms appear, suggesting that transmission is possible before the main symptoms develop.
Only a few reports of non-symptomatic samples have been confirmed by the laboratory, but non-symptomatic transmission has been identified in some countries during contact tracking surveys.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) notes that although it is not clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two or three others.
Specifically, the virus was found to be found in up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 in stainless steel, one day in cardboard, and up to four hours in powder.
This, however, varies depending on the temperature and temperature.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British geeks recommend that one wash his hands after touching animals, as is the case after touching areas that people may have touched with the virus.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, which was first isolated from three people with smoking sickness in connection with a series of respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All symptoms of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in a manner related to the nature of the coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus dies from a domestic tumor, as it melts its external immune system. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is caused by the transmission of infection from an animal.
Genetic studies have revealed that the coronavirus is genetically linked to the Betacoronavirus strain, a subtype of the Sarbecovirus (lineage B) and to the footprints of mosquitoes.
It is 96% the same in all the nutrient levels of other mole samples. (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is one amino acid that is a distinct amino acid in certain parts of the food chain between bacteria from pangolins and those in humans.
All the nutrient comparisons to date have found that there may be 92% of the actual nutrients between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate carriers.
Infection with the virus may in some cases be detected by detecting symptoms, although certainty eventually comes from changing the transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of the infused strain or by CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR and CT in Wuhan suggested that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, although its accuracy is less, as many of its images group to other pneumonia and disease processes.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology suggests that ""CT should not be used for testing or as the first COVID-19 screening procedure"."
WHO has published a number of RNA testing rules for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed with breathing samples or blood samples.
Results are usually achieved in a period of about a few hours to days.
The test is usually performed with a nasopharyngeal swab, although a throat swab can also be used.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these have been proven to be accurate enough to be authorized for universal use.
In the US, a Cellex-developed natural process test is authorized for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of the imaging on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people showing symptoms include asymmetrical peripheral ground glass opacities and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society compiles a worldwide online database of images of confirmed specimens.
Because of the spread of other diseases such as adenovirus, taking photos without PCR confirmation limits accuracy in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the effects of CT and PCR on tuberculosis and showed that although the image has little to explain the infection, it is quick and sensitive, raising the possibility of being considered a testing tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to be able to examine the features of viral imaging with both radiographs and CT scans.
Antibiotic techniques include keeping a clean, clean hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing using wiping paper and applying wiping paper directly to the can.
Those who may have been infected are encouraged to wear a face mask in public.
Physical distancing measures have also been encouraged to prevent transmission.Many governments have restricted or warned against unnecessary travel to or from countries affected by the pandemic.
But the virus has reached the point of spreading to communities widely in parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading among communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how they are infected. Healthcare providers who care for someone who may be infected are encouraged to use a set method of surveillance, monitoring contact, and eye protection.
Using local data from government pockets for this purpose has removed concerns about privacy rights, Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for limitations on this approach to surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been installed or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen teams of experts have been working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log in to other mobile phones.
Users can now receive a message when the incident occurs and approach someone who has been tested positive for COVID-19. There are many misconceptions surrounding ways to prevent infection; for example, cleaning the nose and mouthwashing does not work.
There is no cure for COVID-19, although many organizations are working on building it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially when leaving the toilet or when the stools are dirty; before eating; and after coughing, coughing, or sneezing.
The reason for this is that outside the human body, the virus is killed by the household soap, because it blows up its protective bubble.
The CDC also encourages the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol by volume if soap and water are not available at that time.
WHO encourages people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unclean hands.
The sites can be cleared of contaminants with a few solutions (within one minute of exposure to the stainless steel site), including 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzonium chloride and crohexidine gluconate, are of low efficacy.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in a location such as an office or preschool, all areas such as offices, toilets, public areas, public appliances such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines that patients have used, must be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people keep their mouths shut and their noses covered with their knees or their tissue when coughing, or when weeping, and that any tissue be immediately discarded.
Surgeon's masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask limits the amount and distance of breathing droplets that come out when you talk, vomit, and cough.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to wear a mask.
"According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, ""Wearing a mask can reduce the tendency [of] people to touch the face, which is the main source of infection without proper hand hygiene. ""Masks are also recommended for use by those caring for someone who may be ill".
WHO has recommended that people who are sick should only wear masks when they are at high risk, such as those caring for someone with COVID-19, although it also admits that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Many countries have begun promoting the use of face masks by members of the public.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing a fabric mask rather than a medical one. China has specifically encouraged non-sick members of the public to wear disposable health masks, especially when in close proximity to others.
Hong Kong encourages the wearing of a protective mask when taking public transportation or sitting in crowded areas.
Health workers in Thailand encourage people to make masks from fabric at home and clean them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia legally banned going out public without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a mask when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government imposed a mask on everyone entering a grocery store.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear a masks when in public.
Taiwan, as it continues to produce ten million face masks a day since mid-March, has asked city bus and train passengers to wear face masks on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask whenever you go out, while encouraging the manufacture of a face mask at home for those who cannot afford it.
Face masks were widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Residential isolation (also known as physical isolation) includes measures to control infection intended to slow the spread of disease by reducing close contact with people.
The roads include segregation; travel restrictions; and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, and shopping centers.
Individuals may use methods of isolation by staying at home, cutting off visits, avoiding crowded places, greeting without contact, and physically isolating themselves from others.
Many governments now mandate or encourage social distancing in those areas affected by the pandemic.
The high number of gatherings proposed by U.S. government branches and health organizations was cut to 250 people (if there was no spread of COVID-19 in the area) to 50 people, and later to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany officially closed a public gathering of more than two people. Elderly people and those with existing health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, pneumonia, and declining immune systems face serious illness and problems and the CDC warned them to stay at home as much as possible in public areas with epidemics. In late March 2020, the WHO and other health departments began using the term 'separation' instead of 'social isolation', to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social, online or on-site communication.
"The use of the term ""social isolation"" leads to the conclusion that people should fully participate in the isolation by living, rather than encourage them to continue to interact in different ways.Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines that can be used while the epidemic continues".
These include encouragement to have sex only with a housemate, who is free of the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Isolating themselves from home has been encouraged for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they may be infected.
Health authorities have issued extensive regulations to restrict proper quarantine from the home.
The most severe home confinement guidelines have been passed by those in the most vulnerable groups.
Those who may have been infected with COVID-19 and those who have recently visited a country or region with a widespread transmission are encouraged to lock themselves in for 14 days from the time of their last exposure.
Epidemic control techniques are to contain or suppress, and to reduce.
Closure is followed in the early stages of the epidemic and the aim is to identify and isolate those infected and to introduce other infection control and herbal remedies to prevent the spread of the disease to other people.
If it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts are made to move from a phase to a phase of mitigation: measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its effects on health care and society.
The binding of both the containment and reduction steps may be followed at the same time.
The pressure requires very strong measures to delay the epidemic by reducing the simple number of births to less than 1. Part of the management of the outbreak of an infectious disease is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as the plague line.
This reduces the risk of finding health services frustrating and gives more time for the development of drugs and herbs.
Non-medical interventions that can control outbreaks include personal protective measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, lockdown, social measures aimed at physical isolation such as closing schools and cancelling social events; participating in promoting public acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as ecological measures such as cleaning up areas.
Other countries have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has launched a public observation and has conducted local detentions, and issued warnings about the movement of those infected.
Singapore has provided financial support for those infected in detention and forced higher wages on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan has increased the production of face masks and imposed a penalty for smuggling medical supplies. The situation in Great Britain and the United States shows that mitigation (to slow down but not to stop the spread of the epidemic) and repression (to slow down the spread of the epidemic) have major challenges.
Basic reduction laws may reduce the heavy need for health care by 2/3 and death by half, yet the result is hundreds of thousands of deaths and health care system failure.
Stress may improve but needs to be maintained as long as the virus continues to circulate in the human community (or until a cure is found, if that comes first), as transmission jumps as soon as the steps are released.
Long-term intervention to suppress the epidemic causes social and economic costs.
There are no specific drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking prescription medications, drinking liquids, and resting can help to alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity, breathing therapy, intake fluid, and breathing support may be needed.
Using steroids may have little effect.
Many of the ingredients that were approved for use in other diseases are being studied for use in treating COVID-19.
"WHO also issued a statement that some ""old and home remedies"" may provide relief from the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19".
Strengthening and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients is proposed by WHO as a critical response to the outbreak.
ECDC and the WHO's European regional office have issued guidelines for hospitals and healthcare providers by moving resources into different phases, including focusing lab activities on COVID-19 testing, cancelling preferred procedures where possible, filtering and isolating certified COVID-19 patients, and increasing the capacity of critical care by alerting staff and increasing the number of respiratory and beds.
There are differing opinions about where the first example (called the egg patient) came from.
The first known example of the new coronavirus goes back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In about a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei rose slightly.
These were closely linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and the idea that the virus originated from one of these species; or, in other words, it has an animal origin. The unknown case of mad lung pneumonia was detected on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported to Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
"On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their brothers about the ""SARS-like coronavirus"."
Eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, were charged by the police with spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was taunted by his superiors for shouting.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and reported to WHO.
Sufficient cases of unknown pneumonia had been reported by Wuhan health authorities that they could withdraw the investigation in early January.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other regions of China, helped by transportation due to the Chinese New Year and Wuhan being a hub for transportation and major rail exchanges.
On January 20, China reported about 140 cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data showed that 6,174 people then showed symptoms on 20 January 2020. Since 26 March, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. Since 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
At least 200 countries and territories have at least one example.
As a result of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have set limits on free movement and have proposed border controls.
The national response includes measures such as lockdowns (known as house arrest guidelines, shelter guidelines, or lockdowns) and deadlines. Since April 2, some 300 million people, or 90% of the population, are under some form of lockdown in the United States, more than 50 million people are under lockdown in the Philippines, at least 59 million people are under lockdown in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people are under lockdown in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under a form of lockdown, which rose to 2.6 billion two days later - about three quarters of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report suggests the first case was on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian looked at a series of samples of unknown cause pneumonia on December 26, when his hospital reported to Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
The first genetic testing of patients samples on 27 December 2019 revealed the presence of a coronavirus-like SARS.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
The WHO was notified on the same day.
"As these notices emerged, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police about ""spreading rumors"" about the outbreak".
"The Chinese National Health Commission began by claiming that there was ""no evidence"" of human-to-human transmission".
"In late January, the Chinese government launched a massive campaign later described by Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping as a ""people's war"" to curb the spread of the virus".
"In what has been called the ""biggest lockdown in human history"", a sanitation rope was announced on 23 January to close the entrance and exit of Wuhan, which was extended to the total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of 57 thousand people".
Using your car was forbidden in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) were canceled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was built later, the Leishenshan Hospital, to care for more patients.
In addition to building new hospitals, China also turned 14 places in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government began other measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including issuing health notices for travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools in the country were also closed.
The provinces of Hong Kong and Macau introduced a few measures, especially regarding schools and universities.
Remote work measures were introduced in a few regions of China.
Restrictions on movement were imposed both inside and outside Hubei.
Public transportation was improved, and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
"Control of public movement was introduced in many cities, and it is estimated that at least 760 million people (more than half the population) experienced some form of outdoor confinement. After the outbreak entered the global stage in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from ""entering"" from other countries".
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day mandatory lockdown on all international travelers arriving in the city. On March 23, the mainland in China had only had one example of an internal transfer five days earlier, this time by a traveler returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of the internal transmission of the cases had been stopped and that the outbreak was controlled in China.
On the same day as the easing of travel restrictions in Hubei, outside of Wuhan, two months after the imposition of a lockdown. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for visa holders or residence permit holders will be suspended from 28 March onwards, without specific details on when the policy will expire.
Those wishing to enter China will have to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates in China.
The Chinese government has encouraged businesses and industries to reopen on March 30, and provided companies with a huge stimulus. The State Council has declared a three-minute national day of fasting beginning at 10:00 a.m. on April 4, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government has asked families to express their gratitude online to monitor physical isolation and avoid a re-emergence of COVID-19.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
State health officials reported a notable rise in confirmed cases on February 20, largely due to the Daegu gathering of a new religious group known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji volunteers who had visited Daegu from Wuhan were accused of suppressing the outbreak.
As of February 22, among the 9,336 church followers, 1,261 or at least 13% reported symptoms.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on February 29.
All military bases in South Korea have been closed after testing confirmed three soldiers infected..
The flight schedules were also affected and thus changed. South Korea has introduced what is considered the world's largest and most sophisticated system for testing the population for the virus, isolating and tracking anyone infected and locking up those who have made contact with them.
The methods of observation include compulsory self-reporting of symptoms to foreigners through a cell phone system, passing the virus by car when results are obtained the next day, and increasing the capacity of testing that will allow 20,000 people to be screened daily.
The South Korean plan is considered a successful programme in controlling the epidemic despite the complete closure of cities. South Korean society was at first divided in opinion when President Moon Jae-in reacted to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed letters of recommendation for an investigation into Moon after allegations that the government did not handle the situation properly during the outbreak, while others have signed letters of appreciation for the measures taken.
On March 23, it was reported that the number of cases in South Korea had fallen by more than in any other day in four weeks.

Plans to reduce traffic from one city to another were announced in March, although traffic remained high as the New Year's holiday of Nowruz approached.
The Qom Shiite mosques remained open until 16 March 2020. In February Iran became the epicenter of the outbreak, following China.
Suspicions that Iran has reduced the actual number of cases to transmit a false picture prompted more than a dozen countries with cases to investigate the origin of the disease. They found that the disease had already been present in Iran on February 28, the date the Iranian government reported only 388 cases, which may mean that the number was much higher than reported.
On March 3, the Iranian Parliament was shut down after 23 of its 290 members were found to be infected.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch urged the prison authorities in Iran to unconditionally release those who were holding peaceful protests and to temporarily release well-mannered prisoners.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has issued a directive to cut costs to countries severely affected by the global pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, it was confirmed that the virus had spread to Italy when visitors from China were found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
The numbers of infected people rose rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China, and then to declare a state of emergency.
Later, another group of 16 COVID-19 cases were found in a separate area, and reports of them were first reported on February 21 in Lombardy. On February 22, the Council of Ministers issued a formal declaration on measures to prevent the spread of the virus, including the social isolation of more than 50,000 people infected with the virus in 11 cities in northern Italy.
"Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, ""No one will be allowed to enter or leave these areas with high numbers of viruses".
"All activities and sports have been suspended in these areas". On March 4, the Italian government announced the closure of all schools and universities throughout Italy after the death toll from the virus reached 100".

A CNN report suggested that the rise in the number of deaths in Italy may have been due to the high age of the population and the lack of testing methods for those infected.
The UK's response to the first outbreak of the disease has shown a lack of progress compared to other affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British government had not made plans for people to reduce contact levels or for those infected to be isolated from the public so that the disease did not spread.
As a result, people have criticized the government for not taking this matter seriously and for its response to public concerns. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a proclamation against unnecessary travel and social interaction, urging people to work from home if possible and to avoid places such as bars, restaurants, and theaters and cinemas.
On March 20, the government announced that leisure facilities such as bars and gyms would be shut down immediately, promising to pay workers a share of the wages of about 80% but no more than 2,500 a month to avoid job losses during this period.
Unlike previous measures, this time the police were set up to ensure that people followed the directions and to punish those who disobeyed, who dispersed the groups.
"Many businesses were ordered to close, except for those operating ""essential"" items such as grocery stores, pharmacies, banks, tool shops, gas stations, and car dealerships".

On January 28, 2020, the United States government's leading medical center, the Center for Disease Control, announced that it had developed a test kit for the virus.
Despite these measures, the United States delayed the start of testing programs for the number of infected people, making it difficult to determine the extent of the spread of the disease.
The control of the spread of the disease was interrupted by the lack of efficient testing tools as those sent to the government office in February were dead, the lack of government approval to use testing tools from private organizations (such as research and education institutions, companies, and hospitals) until the end of February and the lack of testing conditions until early March (after which a doctor's letter was required).

As of March 28, 32,308 people had been infected in New York City, 672 of whom had died from the virus. On March 26, the number of coronavirus cases reported in the United States exceeded the number in other countries worldwide, including China and Italy.
In a press release on March 30, U.S. President Trump decided to extend the deadline for the declaration of a state of emergency until April 30.

WHO is contributing to efforts by Chinese authorities to control and contain the epidemic.
"WHO has noted a difference between the 20022004 SARS outbreak, when Chinese authorities were accused of covertly acting which caused difficulties in protection and slowed down containment efforts, and the current situation in which the central government ""has regularly provided updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays"."
"On 23 January, in response to the decision of the main authorities to impose a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that while this is ""absolutely not a WHO incentive"", at the same time ""the most important commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it is most concentrated"" and called it ""unprecedented in the history of public health"". On 30 January, following the conviction of human-to-human transmission outside China and the rise in the number of cases in other countries, WHO announced the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC since the 2009 swine flu epidemic began to be called for".
"WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said PHEIC was the cause of ""the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without a robust health system".
"In response to the imposition of travel restrictions, Tedros has issued a statement that ""there is no reason for measures affecting international travel and trade without necessity"" and that ""WHO does not encourage restrictions on trade and movement"""

"Tedros went on to report that we are only as strong as the weakest of us"" and urged the international community to ""invest today or pay more tomorrow"". On 11 February, WHO during a press conference set COVID-19 as the name of the epidemic".
"On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide ""a power to the entire UN process in response"."
"The UN Disaster Management Group was launched as a result, allowing for the co-operation of the United Nations response, which the WHO says will allow it to ""focus on health response where some representatives bring their own expertise to catching the widespread residential, economic and developmental impact of the outbreak"."
"On 14 February, a WHO-led China-led Joint Purpose Group was launched to equip world and WHO experts in the Chinese basement to assist in the internal care and mitigate the ""extensive and contagious spread of the virus"" situation by opening seminars hosting workshops and conferences with key national level institutions and running a field visit program to assess ""the impact of regional and provincial response activities, including urban and rural conditions"". On 25 February, WHO established that ""the country must make preparedness for the potential coronavirus pandemic,"" reporting that although it is very early but the pandemic, countries must be more ""expectative"".
"In response to the increase in outbreaks in Iran, WHO has sent a Joint Task Force there to analyse the situation. On 28 February, WHO issued a statement that the global risk assessment of coronavirus will be raised from ""high"" to ""extremely high"", which is the highest level of warning and risk analysis".
"Mike Ryan, WHO's chief health emergency officer, warned with the words ""This is the time for all governments in the world to be on the lookout: Wake up".
"The virus may be on its way and needs to be expected,"" begging that positive response measures can help the world avoid its ""worst possible outcome"."
"Ryan also said that the current data did not call for public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying that issuing such a declaration would mean ""recognizing that everyone in the world will be exposed to the virus""".
On March 11, the WHO announced an outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.

Experts emphasize that everyone has the right to health care, including disabled people, minorities, the elderly, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, people in prison, and refugees and other unnamed groups who need government assistance.
Government agencies are taking care of the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has launched a program to provide timely and comprehensive information on how countries will respond to international law, as well as ideas and advice.

The Chinese government has been heavily criticized by the United States, UK Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for their handling of the epidemic, which began in China's Hubei provinces.
A number of state-level candidates for the Communist Party of China (CPC) were expelled for the way they handle detention efforts in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political branch's response to the outbreak in those areas.
Some analysts believe that the move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese workers, for example Zhao Lijian, initially refused to accept the first coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, preferring conspiracy theories about COVID-19 as coming from the U.S. or Italy.
"The U.S. administration of Donald Trump once called the coronavirus ""Chinese virus"" and the ""Wuhan virus"" saying China's process ""of covertly empowering the virus that has now become a global pandemic"", which has since been criticized by some critics as being "discriminatory and disruptive to the failure of its administration to contain the disease".
"The Daily Beast reached out to a U.S. journalist who detailed a communication strategy that apparently came from the National Security Council, citing the strategy as ""Everything is about China".
"We are told to try to get this message out by any means possible, including press conferences and TV appearances. "" Broadcasters such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg have reported that China's efforts to send aid to the virus-affected countries are part of a propaganda ploy to influence the world".
"EU foreign policy official Josep Borrell warned that there is ""a local political impulse that combines a struggle for influence with 'politics of openness.'"
"Borrell also said ""China is pushing hard for the message that, unlike the US, it is a responsible and trustworthy partner"""
China has also spoken out for the US to lift its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, although it is reportedly sending aid to the latter two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. authorities are also accused of diverting foreign aid to their country.
There have also been reports of masks being worn among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey plundered hundreds of ventilators heading to Spain.
In early March, the Italian government blamed the European Union for not being united with Italy and for being hit by the coronavirus.

"This is certainly not a good sign of European unity"""
On March 22, after telephone conversations with the Italian prime minister, Russian president Vladimir Putin arranged for the Russian army to send Italian military medical personnel, special antibacterial vehicles, and other medical equipment.
"The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted a ""high political source"" as saying that 80% of Russian aid ""was of little or no help to Italy"""

"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said ""if we accept help from our US partners, [Putin] is suggesting that US manufacturers of medical devices will be able to do the same for us if needed"""
"NATO's planned military exercises ""Defender 2020"" in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, which are NATO's largest military exercises since the end of the Cold War, will be conducted at reduced rates".
"Secretary General of The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson has criticized the Defender 2020 trial: ""Amid a public health crisis, it is putting at risk not only the lives of soldiers from the US and other participating European countries but also the citizens of the countries where they work. ""The Iranian government is under great pressure from the virus, as there are as many as twenty-four infected parliamentarians and as many as fifteen current or former politicians".
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a letter to international leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, his country struggling to fight the pandemic due to the inability to access global markets caused by United States sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has led to recommendations for the United States to adopt social policies as considerate as other wealthy nations, public health care, childcare, family leave and high-quality public health support.
Political analysts expect it may adversely affect Donald Trump's chances of winning the 2020 presidential election again. Political relations between Japan and South Korea have also deteriorated due to the pandemic.
"South Korea has condemned Japan for ""false imprisonment attempts"" after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea would be detained for two weeks in government-appointed facilities"

Few places have seen rushed purchases of basic goods such as food, toilet paper, and water that have caused shortages of necessities
The technology industry has been warning of delays in transporting electrical goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased by a factor of 100.
This demand has led to a rise in prices to twenty times the average purchase price and has created a delay in medical supplies of four to six months
It also caused a global shortage of personal protective equipment and even the WHO warned that this was putting the lives of medical workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has created a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products to China
This has led to a shortage of bottled food for children in some supermarkets that the Australian government has closed down. Despite the high level of Covid-19 in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region and the high demand for food that followed, both areas have not caused a major shortage of food.
China's and Italy's measures against the accumulation and trafficking of vital goods have been successful and have prevented the food shortage expected in Europe and North America
Northern Italy and its abundant agriculture have not seen a significant decline, but according to industry representatives, prices may rise.
The shelf shortage was temporary even in the city of Wuhan, and in China, government officials have released the pig meat that was stored to ensure the nutrition of the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy requiring food service providers to collect for emergencies.
The global economic downturn was felt in China, according to media reports on 16 March 2020, China's economy suffered a major downturn in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to contain the spread of the virus, which in shops fell by 20.5%

Many large-scale events have been cancelled by international and regional governments including New Year celebrations and private companies also closing shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar festivals and tourist sites have also been closed to curb crowds including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple ceremonies.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities, and municipalities, authorities have extended the New Year's holiday to February 10, telling all workplaces not to open until that date.
These regions represent 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has raised the rate of transmission of infectious diseases to a level that has been marked as a state of emergency, schools closed until March to celebrate the new year.
Shopping visits in Europe and Latin America declined by 40%
North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% decline
This has resulted in a 33 to 43 percent drop in shoppers in March compared to February.
Worldwide shopping mall owners have set new targets, such as cleaning and installing thermal scanners. to monitor consumer temperatures and cancel events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the economic downturn caused by the pandemic could leave 14 to 22 million people more suffering than they would have been without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the Wuhan epidemic, 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of the estimated 300 million migrant workers are trapped in their homes in the interior provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
The coronavirus pandemic could take 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32% according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Imprisonment in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers with daily pay unemployment. A study by the Angus Rei Institute found that 44% of Canadian homes have ever been affected by unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers in Spain have lost their jobs since the country's lockdown began in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers signed up for temporary benefits and 1 million British workers signed up for a universal credit scheme.
This German shorter-term work schedule has been adopted by France and Britain.
The arts and culture industries have been significantly affected by the pandemic and the work of organizations and individuals - both employed and self-employed - has been disrupted worldwide
Arts and cultural organizations have tried to carry out their programmes, often government-sponsored, to open up places to the public and keep their workers and society safe and supporting heroes.
Then in March 2020, around the world and at varying levels, museums, libraries, playgrounds and cultural venues were closed indefinitely, museums and sports were cancelled or postponed.
Efforts were made to meet the needs of the world through technological means, including the rapid abolition of religious, sporting, and other public events such as festivals and concerts and technology and fashion conferences.
The Vatican has announced that the celebration of Holy Week in Rome, which takes place during the last week of the Christian Lent, has been cancelled.
The radio programs have encouraged older Christians to stay home rather than attend church services on Sundays.
By closing its churches and St. Peter's Square and removing all pilgrims and other organizations, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome has cancelled or restricted gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurdwaras
The Ministry of Health in Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas and the closure of places of worship and in Saudi Arabia the ban on believers from other countries and local citizens entering the holy buildings in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the biggest disruption to sports programs worldwide since World War II.
Many major sports have been postponed or discontinued entirely, including the 2019 to 2020 UEFA Champions League, 2019 to 2020 Premier League, 2020 UEFA Euro, 2019 to 2020 NBA Season and 2019 to 2020 NHL season.
"This outbreak has disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics schedules that were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the games ""will be rescheduled for a period after 2020 but not before the summer of 2021"". Casinos and other sports venues around the world have been closed and live poker tournaments have been postponed or canceled".
This has led to online gambling, with many gambling sites reporting a dramatic increase in sign-ups. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with bands suspending or withdrawing concert tours.
Many theaters, such as those on Broadway, have suspended all performances.
"Some artists have explored ways to continue recording and sharing their work online instead of playing live as usual, such as making live streaming of concerts or creating web-based ""events"" for artists to play, broadcast and inform the public more about their work".
Many memes about the coronavirus have spread online as many turn to humor and distractions in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, a high level of discrimination, racial and racial discrimination has been noted against people of Chinese and East Asian origin and against people from parts of Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility have been noted in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports in February, when most of the patients were still within China's borders, noted feelings of racial prejudice expressed by various groups around the world as whether the Chinese people deserve the virus or receive what is called a retaliatory response.
Some African countries have seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported being discriminated against because of their ethnic background
There is Chinese support both on social media and in real life for those in the areas affected by the virus.
Following the spread of the outbreak in some countries, the people of Italy, the first country in Europe to have a serious Covid-19 outbreak, may face criticism and racial discrimination. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have begun signing applications in conjunction with campaigns to block Chinese entry in an attempt to curb the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has become popular on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported increasing rates of discrimination and beatings.
"U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as ""Chinese Virus"", a term critics consider to be racist and anti-Chinese".
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners who had been returned from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, which shares a border with China and who study in India's major cities, have reportedly been exposed to the coronavirus outbreak.
"The president of The Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh said the Chinese have killed nature and ""that is why the gods have avenged themselves on them""
"These statements have been rejected by the Chinese embassy in Kolkata, calling themselves ""false"". In China, racism and racial discrimination against non-Chinese people have been fueled by the epidemic, foreigners have been called ""foreign garbage"" and are being "destroyed""
Many paid newspapers have withdrawn or stopped paying for coronavirus news.
Many scientific publishers have published scientific papers about the outbreak that are freely available.
Some scientists have chosen to share their findings quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Repiratory coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19 and related SARS-CoV-2 virus testing combines methods to detect the presence of the virus and those that detect the antibodies that are produced as a result when a person is infected.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR detecting the presence of coronavirus RNA.
This study is specifically designed to test the RNA of the SARS-Cov-2 virus.
It is used to confirm the detection of a recent or ongoing disease.
Antibody testing, serology, can be used both for human disease testing or for the hiring of an astronaut.
An antibody test shows how many people have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to be reported or none at all.
Accurate statistics of mortality from the disease and the level of infectious disease in the population can be found from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing figures, during March 2020, no countries had reliable statistics on the prevalence of the virus in their communities.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and there are significant differences in the number of tests that have been conducted in different countries.
This variation may have a major impact on reported death rates that may be exaggerated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, rRt-PCR, the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various means, including nasopharyngeal swab or sputum sample.
Results are usually obtained within two hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests with throat swabs can be reliable only in the first week of infection.
In the future, the virus may disappear from the throat but continue to spread in the gums.
In infected people tested at the second week, some sample material can be removed from the deep airways by suction catheter or by coughing up the material, sputum, can be used.
Some of the first PCR test methods were developed at Charite in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ,irRT-PCR, which formed the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization, WHO.
The United Kingdom had also developed a test method on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARSCoV-2 clinical standard test kit on 28 January 2020.
"Finds the same ""E gene"" in all beta coronaviruses and RDRp gene found only in SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the companies that received emergency approval from China's National Products Administration to use a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, is distributing the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, 2019-Novel, Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to clinical testing facilities through the International Reagent Resource".
Three genetic tests on older test kit methods caused vague results due to poorly functioning reagents and a test run at the CDC in Atlanta, resulting in an average of less than 100 successful samples per day throughout February 2020.
The two-part testing was not found to be reliable until 28 February 2020 and until then when provincial and local testing centres were allowed to start testing.
The test method was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization.
On 5 March 2020 LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing
Quest Diagnostics has likewise made COVID-19 testing available from 9 March 2020
No statistical limitations have been announced, and the collection and digestion of specimens should be done in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia , COVID-19 testing was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR
On 11 February 2020 this test method was registered with the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test type for COVID-19 management. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test type that can be performed within 3.5 hours thus allowing one machine to perform 4128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued the Abbott Laboratories emergency authorization, EUA, to investigate the Abbott m2000 protocol, the FDA had previously granted the same authorization to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid similarly received EUA through the FDA for a test type that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test model that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Because this does not require a series of cold and hot cycles, this species can produce positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. A test using a monoclonal antibody specifically attached to the nucleocapsid protein, N protein, for the novel coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan in the hope that it can deliver results in 15 to 20 minutes similar to a flu test.
"A literature review in March 2020 concluded that ""radiographs of the chest are not as helpful in the early stages and CT, computer tomography, may be available before symptoms begin to appear".
Common features of CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacifities with periheral, asymetricand posterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving and consolidation increase as the disease changes.
A comparative study of PCR and CT in Wuhan where the outbreak began suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR but lacks data, many of its features being associated with other pneumonia and disease processes.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ""CT be used to screen or test for COVID-19 for the first time""In March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR in the hospital for the first time""
Part of the immune response in disease management is the production of antibodies including -Igm and GG.
These can be used to test for the presence of disease from 7 days or more after the onset of symptoms, to identify immunity and social inclusion. Assays can be performed by major testing centers, CLTs, or point-of-care testing, PoCT.
The high level of automated systems in many medical laboratories will be able to operate through essays but their availability will depend on the speed of each production.
With CLT, only one peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although serial samples can be used for immune response.
With PoCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by scenting the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, a breakdown step is not required before the test. On March 26, 2020, the FDA released the names of 29 agencies that reported to the agency as necessary and are now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test method has been approved by the FDA under emergency authorization.In late March 2020, Euroiminium Medical Laboratoryay Diagnostics and Epitome Diagnostics received approval for its European test kits that can test for IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The test dose is a few hundred samples per hour so it is much faster than conventional PCR assay of Viral RNA.
The presence of antibodies is usually tested 14 days after diagnosis.In April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits it had purchased could be used effectively.
"In Hong Kong a scheme has been introduced where suspected patients can stay at home, a ""emergency department that will give a patient a specimen tube"", to scrub in, return it and get results after a while. The British NHS has announced that it is launching a home screening scheme that eliminates the threat of infection from the patient if he goes to the clinic or the need to disinfect the patient's vehicles if any are used.
The passing-through centres have helped South Korea to conduct the fastest, most focused test of any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians spoke on March 2, saying it had the capacity to carry out about 12,000 tests a day through the promotion program and 10,700 tests had been carried out last week.
Costs are covered by health insurance when the examination is called by the doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to hold 160,000 tests a week.
From March 19 a pass-through test was given in many major cities.
As of 26 March 2020 the total number of tests carried out by Germany was unknown, as only accurate results were reported.
"The first laboratory survey showed that from the calendar week 12/2020 a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested until and including the week 12/2020 with 33,491 samples (6.9%) when tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital and his team tested a sample method on 64 patients once, by combining samples and additional testing only when the combined sample showed confirmation. In Wuhan the 2000-sq-meter-scale emergency laboratory laboratory called Hua-Yan"" (Chinese: 火眼, or ""Eye in English") conducted more than 50,000 tests per day in February 2020, with a total of 55,000 samples being tested.
With the building being managed by BGI founder Wang Jian and lasting 5 days, the simulation shows that samples in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the appropriate cost to meet the detention would have doubled if the capacity of the test contents had not been available in time.
The Wuhan Laboratory was quickly followed by the Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020 the total day-to-day transmission has been 50,000 tests per day. Open source, complex graphics released by Origami Assays are open to test samples of up to 112 patients with COVID19 using only 93 assays. These technically measured graphics can be applied in small labs without the need for liquid-handling robots.
Since March, the lack and insufficient number of reagents has been a major factor in the majority of EU-UK and US trials.
This has led some authors to review the regulations for preparing samples involving heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release further tested RNA molecules. On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing its population more with the Coronavirus per capita than any other country, and is moving well in raising the test rate to reach a larger proportion of the population.
"This was a combination of power-by-drilling, and the purchase of a population-scale mass-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on the""Huo-Yan"" emergency detection laboratories in China)."
Built in 14 days, the lab was able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and was the first in the world of this kind to be operational outside China.
Different methods of cognitive testing on different components of coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization chose the German method of manufacturing kits that were exported to poor countries without the resources to build their own.
The German procedure was published on 17 January 2020; legislation introduced by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not discovered until 28 January, delaying the testing available in the U.S. China and the United States faced problems with the reliability of test kits at the start of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to develop and produce enough kits to satisfy the need and encourage health professionals.
In contrast, experts say that the widespread availability of testing in South Korea has helped to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.
The capacity to contain the experiments, especially in private laboratories, was built over many years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for the enablement of testing procedures as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the extent of the spread of the virus caused the accumulation of hundreds of thousands of workers in U.S. private laboratories, and the release of swabs and chemical reagents was depressing.
In March 2020 China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
"In the United States, CDC-designed test kits were found to be ""defective;"" the government removed the legal barriers to secret testing. Spain bought the kits from a Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results to be inaccurate".
The company explained that the wrong results may be caused by judging the collection of samples or the correct use of kits.
The Spanish ministry said it would issue test kits that show incorrect results, and replace them with separate kits provided for Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China produced incorrect results.
"Prime Minister Matovič suggested that it be discarded for installation in the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Health Ministry said that the Turkyewhich purchased test kits from China were found to have a ""high degree of error"" and were not ""used"". The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 announced that they were out of service".
The test, followed by the detention of those who were found to be confirming when tested and followed by those who had contact with people who showed to confirm if they were being tested for SARS-CoV-2, results were also confirming.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of Italy's first COVID-19 death, conducted two rounds of a total of 3,400 people, at least ten days apart.
At least half of the people who confirmed the test had no symptoms, and all samples found were forged.
Since visits are limited, this eliminates completely new infections.
With the vigorous follow-up of the affected, restricted inbound tourism, inspections, and lockdowns, the 2020 coronavirus outbreak in Singapore has continued to slow down much more than in other developed countries, but without tough restrictions such as forcing the closure of food stores and other retail outlets.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home on March 28, but schools opened on time after the March 23 holiday break.
Several countries have also managed to cope with the pandemic by actively tracking contacts, restricting internal travel, inspecting, and detaining, but to a lesser extent by shutting down, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistical research has found that countries that have more research, compared to the death toll, have lower death rates, which may be due to the fact that they are better placed to investigate those with or without severe symptoms.
WHO urges countries with limited capacity to contain testing and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience to send the first five and ten confirmed COVID-19 samples to one of WHO's 16 trusted laboratories to confirm testing.
Of the 16 reliable laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 is in North America and 1 is in Australia.
In the following table, the column Confirmation % of testing is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that tests only hospitalized people will have more confirmed per cent of tests than a country that tests all its citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, other factors are equal.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands with the intention of removing dirt, grease, small objects, or unwanted potatoes.
Washing hands with soap without delay during those "critical times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the oral system.
People can also get respiratory diseases such as a cold or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (that is, the skin's narrowing).
Five critical periods during the day when hand washing with soap is important include: before and after loosening, after cleaning the baby's hips or changing the diaphragms, before feeding the baby, before and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or pet birds.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be washed with ashes.
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing a toilet or cleaning a child using a toilet.
After coughing, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal contamination.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medication or medical care can prevent or slow the spread of disease.
The main purpose of handwashing is to reduce hand-washing of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause injury or disease.
This is especially important for food managers or medical professionals, but it is an important process even for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of the flu, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the spread of diarrhea; reducing respiratory diseases;
and reduce the rate of infant mortality in home births.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand-washing may lead to a small improvement in the growth rate of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the rate of death among youths related to respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap.
A simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by about 50%.
Interventions that promote handwashing with soap can reduce urinary tract infections by three, and this can be compared to providing clean water to economically deprived areas.
Handwashing with soap is one effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), as is the common behavior that occurs in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the largest ARI, is the single leading cause of death among infants under five years of age, claiming the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children annually.
Both diarrhea and pneumonia contribute to the deaths of about 3.5 million infants a year.
According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before meals and after using the toilet into a deep-rooted practice can save more lives than any other remedy or medical intervention, resulting in death from diarrhea almost half and death from respiratory diseases half.
Hand washing is often combined with other waste-carrying procedures such as water, waste-carrying and sanitation (WASH) systems.
Hand washing also protects against the infection of the common cold that is transmitted through direct contact.
The minor risk that comes from regular hand washing is skin damage caused by dry skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to itching, and a skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is more common among health-care workers.
Frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of the disease through oral sewage: after using the toilet (urine, freeze), after cleaning the baby's hips (change of four), before feeding the baby, before meals or before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or pet birds.
Other times when proper hand washing procedures must be followed to prevent transmission include before and after caring for a cut or injury; after digging, coughing, or sneezing; after touching an animal's skin or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many lands, there is a low standard of hand washing with soap.
A 2015 handwashing survey in 54 countries found that on average, 38.7% of households follow a soap-washing procedure. A 2014 survey showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of handwashing at 97 percent; the United States at nearly 77 percent; and China at the lowest rate of 23 percent. Few practices are now on the rise to adopt the practice of handwashing with soap during critical times.
The "Essential Health Care Program" launched by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of statistical action to promote children's health and education.
Twice a year, the removal of the scabies, along with regular hand washing with soap, daily fluoride brushing, is the cornerstone of the world system.
It has also been successfully launched in Indonesia.
Removing microorganisms from the skin is also better by applying soap or a cleanser in water.
The main function of soap and cleaning is to reduce the blockage of the solution, and increase the solubility.
Water alone is not enough to cleanse the skin because the oils and proteins, which are soil structures, are not easily soluble in water.
But the cleaning is done with the flowing water in proportion..
A soap that is sour, because it can be recycled, may keep the remaining bacteria from working previously.
A small number of studies looking at the transmission of the virus from the contaminated strain of the virus have concluded that it is impossible as the bacteria and dust are cleaned.
The CDC continues that "liquid soap and control without hands is better".
Antibiotic soaps are widely advertised by health-care professionals.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants selects natural antibiotic-resistant organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps have common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has a long list of resistant strains of organisms.
So even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selected for antibacterial soap, they may not be as effective as they are sold.
Other than a surfactant and protective agent for the skin, complex structures may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) such as a pH controller, antimicrobially active benzoic acid and other skin care products (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive study from the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that vacuum soaps are similarly effective as consumer-grade antibacterial soaps with triclosan in preventing disease and removing bacteria from food.
Hot water that you can wash your hands with is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria grow most rapidly when the temperature of the well is 37 °C.
But warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water in removing natural oils that trap soil and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific research has shown that using warm water does not reduce the microbial load on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a waterproof hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990's and early part of the 21st century, water-based hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Many isopropyl alcohols or ethanol are rubbed together with a solvent such as a carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to form a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to form a liquid, or a foam to facilitate the use and reduction of alcohol's dryness.
Adding hydrogen peroxide to a liquid enhances the antimicrobial activity even more. Hand sanitizers have an alcohol content of 60 to 95% that effectively kills bacteria.
Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and other viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 logs in reduction, equivalent to 35 decibels in reduction) of bacteria in the hands within 30 seconds after lubrication and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 logs in reduction) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after lubrication. Hand sanitizers are effective against bacteria and are less effective against certain bacteria.
Hand sanitizers made of alcohol are almost non-existent against norovirus (or Norwalk) strains of bacteria, the main cause of infectious gastroenteritis.
The front and back of both hands and the inside and the ends of the fingers are crushed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel has dried up.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand cleaning rather than hand sanitizers, especially when hands are clearly cleansed.
The high use of these agents is due to their ease of action and quickness in killing microorganisms; however, they should be used to replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Regular use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients and/ or skin moisturizers are added to the mixture.
The alcohol-drying process can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or emollients to the mixture.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with emollients make skin bites much less prone to dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or the additives present in alcohol hand rubs are rare.
The low incidence of irritating contact dermatitis is attractive compared to handwashing with soap and water.
Whatever their function, waterless agents cannot wash their hands from natural materials, but they simply kill germs.
For this reason hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends largely on the ingredients and mixing, and they have historically been more discouraging than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, mixtures using benzonium chloride have shown persistence and increased antimicrobial activity after lubrication, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to reduce the level of activity after repeated operations, may be the cause of a persistent skin reaction.
Many people in poor societies cannot afford soap and use ashes or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ashes get contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because when mixed with water, an alkali mixture is formed.
WHO recommends ash or sand instead of soap if soap is not available.
The proper handwashing recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control for the prevention of disease transmission includes the following steps:
Stretch your hands with running water, whether warm or cold.
Moving water is encouraged because a regular basin may be contaminated, while the temperature or coldness of the water does not make a difference.
Oint your hands by rubbing them with adequate soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap raises bacteria in the skin, and research shows that people tend to wash their hands better when soap is available than when they only use water.
Wait at least 20 seconds.
A rash causes heat, which helps to remove bacteria from the skin, and a prolonged rash removes additional bacteria.
Clean well under running water.
Cleaning the basin can contaminate the hands
Set with a clean cloth or let dry with air.
Wet and damp hands easily absorb dirt - areas that easily forget the thumb, the scalp, the middle of the fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and eaten nail polish can store microorganisms.
Wet lotion is often recommended to keep your hands dry; dry skin can lead to skin damage that can increase the risk of transmission.
Separate, inexpensive systems can be developed to meet hand cleaning when tap water and/or soap are not available e.g. pouring water by hanging a vessel or drum with proper holes and/or using ash if needed in developing countries. In situations with limited water (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to water conservation, such as "tippy-taps" and other forms of saving money.
Tippy-tap is a simple technique of using a stringed drum, a foot-operated tap that drips a small amount of water into the hands and a soap tube.
Effective hand drying is an important part of hand hygiene, but there is controversy about how to improve the efficiency of drying in public toilets.
Increasing research suggests that paper towels are cleaner than electric air dryers found in cleaners.
In 2008, a study conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and funded by the European Tissue Symposium, a paper towel industry, compared the hygiene levels found in paper towels, hot air hand dryers, and recent high-pressure hand dryers.
After cleaning and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to rise by an average of 44% on the fingertips and 254% on the palms of the hands.
The rapid air drying was successful in increasing the total number of bacteria on the fingertips by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After cleaning and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria dropped by an average of 76 percent on the fingertips and 77 percent on the fingertips.
The rapid-fire air-dryer, which blows the air from it at a set speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), successfully blows microorganisms into and out of its hands and almost infected some users and the cleaning facility at a distance of about 2 meters.
The use of hot air has spread microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels did not reveal a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study led by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt examined different methods of hand drying.
The following changes in the number of germs after hand drying were noted:
There are many hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towels.
Hand-washing with hand sanitizing tools is another way to do so when you are on a trip without soap and water.
A hand sanitizer made of alcohol must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing was introduced long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered his work (1846) on the prevention of disease in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that provide comments reminding hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that their effectiveness reduced disease rates.
A medical hand wash takes 15 seconds, using plenty of soap and water or gel to lubricate or rub each hand.
The hands must be rubbed together by the fingers.
If there is dirt under the nails, a bristle brush can be used to remove it.
Since bacteria can survive in water in the hands, it is important to clean them thoroughly and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel must be worn to close the water (and open any exit door if possible).
This avoids further contamination of the hands with such areas.
The purpose of hand washing in a care setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid transmitting them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the practice of hand washing continues to be unacceptable in many medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses continuing to forget to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent.
The organization's guidelines for hand hygiene can be found on its website for public comment.
A proper review directed by Whitby et al.
Store appliances can measure and ensure hand hygiene, if demonstration and compliance with the law are required.
The World Health Organization has "five" times to wash hands:
after exposure to blood/fluid
before aseptic activity, and
The addition of chemicals that inhibit the risk ("medicine" or soaps "microbial detergents") gives lethal power to those that wash hands.
Such lethal force may be needed before surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are plentiful. To 'wash' someone's hands for the purpose of the surgery, a hand-free pump, chlorhexidine or iodine wash, sterile towels to dry hands after cleaning, and a sterile toothbrush and other sterile cleaning instrument under the nails are required.
All ornaments must be copied.
The procedure requires washing hands and arms to the ankle, usually for 2-6 minutes.
Long periods of rest (10 minutes) are not necessary.
When you are shaking, the water in your arms should be kept from running back into your hands.
After the hands are cleaned, the hands are dried with sterile cloth or a surgical garment is worn.
To reduce the spread of the virus, it is best to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
To control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from hand cleaning comes from the first 20% of cleaning, and that very little additional benefit is obtained when hand-cleaning is increased by more than 35%.
Comparing hand-rubbing with alcohol-based solution to hand-washing with antibacterial soap for a median time of 30 seconds each showed that the alcohol hand-rubbing reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than the antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are better at reducing the H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores in the hands than alcohol-based hand rubs. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care settings may include teaching workers to wash their hands, promoting the availability of alcohol-based hand rubs, and written and spoken reminders to employees.
There is a need for further research to investigate which of these interventions works best in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective, vital tool for achieving good health, even physical nutrition.
But the lack of reliable water, soap, or hand sanitizer in people's homes, schools, and workplaces makes it challenging to achieve the world's hand sanitizer practices.
For example, in many rural areas of Africa, hand sanitation taps near private or public toilets are lacking, although there are inexpensive ways to build hand sanitation facilities.
However, low levels of hand washing may be the cause of more entrenched practices than the lack of soap or water.
Advertising and representing handwashing with soap can influence legal decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to a lasting change in public practices.
For this to work properly, monitoring and tracking are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based practices are effective in promoting hand cleaning in LMICs, while social advertising campaigns are less effective. One example of a UNICEF "Three Star Path" school hand cleaning campaign is encouraging schools to take simple, cost-effective steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum levels are reached, schools can move from one and eventually to three stars.
Building hand sanitizers may be part of a campaign to promote hand sanitization to reduce infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is one example of vigilance campaigns that seek to achieve change in practices. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the widespread use of handwashing emoji.
Several studies have considered the overall cost of hand sanitization in developing countries and the relationship to DALYs' prohibition.
But one review suggests that advertising handwashing with soap saves more money than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand hygiene for human health  especially for people in vulnerable conditions such as newborn mothers or injured soldiers in hospitals  was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers in hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "father of modern nursing".
At that time, many people still believed that diseases were caused by the bad smells of miasmas.
In the 1980's, foodborne outbreaks and medical-related illnesses led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to further promote hand washing as an important way to prevent the spread of disease.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have led to increased awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect against this type of infectious diseases.
For example, posters with the inscription "appropriate handwashing" are hung upside down near a handwashing sink in public toilets and in private bathrooms in office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "wash your hands" in something means to make it clear that you do not want anyone else to take responsibility for or be involved in something.
Its origin is in a Bible passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands in making the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a widely used phrase in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth first pressures herself by washing her hands in an attempt to clear the thought of impurity, representing a guilty conscience about the crimes she had committed and persuaded her husband to commit.
It was also found that people, after recalling or thinking about wrong actions, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and they tend to appreciate the importance of hand sanitizers more.
Moreover, when they are not allowed to wash their hands afterward they are less likely to participate in regrets in "cleansing" activities, such as volunteering.
The symbolism of hand washing, using water but without soap to wash hands, is part of the hand-washing process that is present in many religions, including the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and dayim netilat in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Buddhism.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam force hand washing after using the toilet.
Also, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam force washing hands before and after meals.
Workplace controls for the risk of COVID-19
COVID-19 workplace hazard controls are the implementation of occupational safety and health hazard control procedures to prevent the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).
Proper hazard controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and type of work, based on the assessment of the risks of exposure sources, the severity of social illness, and the risks to individual workers that may be weak in preventing COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have low levels of social contact with other workers, for which simple protective measures are encouraged, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home when they are sick, good breathing habits, and maintaining a clean and disinfectant system at work.
Activities with moderate exposure to the virus include those that seek to regularly and closely contact unknown or suspected COVID-19 persons, but may become infected by continuous public transmission or by visiting foreign countries.
This includes workers with common social contacts such as schools, crowded workplaces, and crowded sales environments.
Hazard controls in this group, in addition to simple viral protection measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneezing guards, and having personal protective equipment available in cases where a person is diagnosed with COVID-19.
OSHA considers health and cold workers who are exposed to known or suspected persons with COVID-19 to be at higher risk of exposure, which is higher risk if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures, or download or handle specimens from known or suspected persons with COVID-19.
Suitable hazard controls for these workers include building controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate to the workplace.
the outbreak of *COVID-19 can have serious consequences in the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work because of illness, the need to care for others, or the fear of exposure.
The customs of the seller may change, depending on the type of goods needed, with ways to obtain these goods (such as shopping during off-peak hours or by delivery or by driving).
Finally, shipments from areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted.
Programs consider the levels of hazards involved in different workplaces and types of work, including the type of exposure, hazardous items that occur at home or in public settings, and hazardous items for individual workers such as advanced age or chronic illness conditions.
They also specify appropriate controls to address such hazards, and the following plans for conditions that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Preparation for a communicable disease and response programs may depend on national or state legislation.
The objectives of responding to the outbreak include reducing workplace overcrowding, protecting people at higher risk of serious health problems, maintaining business operations, and reducing the adverse effects on other businesses and suppliers.
The crisis of the disease in the business community affects the response measures taken.
Risk management stairs are a widely used framework in occupational safety and health to integrate risk controls with outcomes.
When the risks of COVID-19 are not eliminated, the best controls are building control, management control, and ultimately personal protective equipment.
Construction controls involve securing workers from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior, and can be a cost-effective measure when installed.
Regulations for managing changes in employment law or procedures requiring action by an employee or employer
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered to be less effective than building control and management control, but it can help to avoid exposure.
All PPE types must be selected on the basis of occupational hazard, properly worn as appropriate (e.g., respirators), regularly worn and properly tested, kept, and replaced, as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned, and stored or disposed to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-exposure jobs have little contact with the public and other peer-to-peer workers.
Simple prevention measures promoted in all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home when sick, good breathing habits including covering coughs and diarrhea, providing tissue and drum components, preparing for homework or different shiftwork as needed, encouraging workers to avoid using other tools and tools, and continuing the process of cleaning and disinfecting the workplace.
The quick detection and isolation of people who may be infected is an important step in protecting employees, customers, employers, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay at home until they have no fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using therapeutic or symptomatic medications, and that sick days regulations be flexible, that workers be allowed to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and that workers know these rules.
According to OSHA, medium-exposure activities include those activities that require regular or close contact by six feet (1.8 m) with suspected COVID-19 patients, with strangers who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing transmission in a community near the workplace, or because someone has recently returned from a foreign country where COVID-19 transmission has spread.
These include public-access personnel such as schools, crowded workplaces, and high-risk retail environments. The establishment of controls for these high-risk groups includes the installation of low-performance air filters, the raising of ventilation levels, the installation of limits such as plastic cleaning monitors, and the installation of a passing window by driving the Customer Service. The management of this high-risk workplace includes the encouragement of sick workers to stay at home, the introduction of a virtual communication system that could indicate that the meeting place was face-to-face, the introduction of disruptive workflows, the elimination of unnecessary travel hazards or the use of COVID-19-related facilities, the use of personal protective equipment, the use of personal protective equipment, the use of personal protective equipment, the use of personal protective equipment, the use of personal protective equipment, the use of personal protective equipment, the use of personal protective equipment, the use of personal protective equipment, the use of personal protective equipment, the use of personal protective equipment, the use of personal protective equipment, the use of personal protective equipment, the use of personal protective equipment, and the use of personal protective equipment, the use of personal protective equipment, and equipment for the use of personal protective equipment, and the use of personal protective equipment of personal protective equipment.
Workers in this exposure group rarely need respirators.
When a person becomes ill in a train, appropriate control measures for insurrection against the crew and other passengers include separating the sick person from others by six shoulders, assigning one crew member to care for the sick person, and giving the sick person a face mask or asking the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew must wear gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated areas, and additional protective equipment may be available if the patient has fever, chronic cough, and difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated areas should be cleaned and disinfected later. As for market vessels, including cruise ships and other passenger transport, hazard control includes delaying travel when sick, and isolating and informing the medical center inside immediately if someone starts to experience heat or other symptoms while on board.
If possible, medical monitoring should be done in the quarters of the person who has been isolated.In schools and kindergartens, the CDC recommends temporary closures for cleaning and disinfection purposes if a person with the virus has ever been inside the school building regardless of the spread.
If there is a small to medium-sized infection in the community, segregation strategies may be introduced such as cancelling field trips, meetings, and other large gatherings such as environmental education, choir classes or eating at the cafeteria, increasing the space between desks, half-arriving and home-hours, blocking unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office space for children with symptoms such as influenza.
When the virus spreads significantly in the community, despite isolation efforts, extended school closures may be considered. For law enforcement officers who perform daily tasks, the health risk is then considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who must contact people who have been confirmed or suspected of having COVID-19 are encouraged to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical personnel, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of over-contact when a person is found, workers should clean and remove germs from their work belts and clothing before reusing them with a spray or household cleaning cloth, and follow common procedures to prevent the spread of germs and discard the PPE used and to store and wash clothes.
OSHA considers that certain medical and cellular workers are at greater or even greater risk of contracting the disease.
The work of those most at risk includes shippers of medical supplies, relief supplies, laboratory personnel, and transportation personnel who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These are the greatest risks of infection if workers are involved in aerosol manufacturing, or collecting or handling samples, from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
The procedures that create aerosol include the insertion of a tube into the body, procedures that cause coughing, bronchoscopies, procedures and certain dental tests, or the collection of body samples.
Cold-pressure exposures to the most dangerous disease include workers involved in preparing the bodies of people with known or suspected COVID-19 deaths; these become the greatest risk when examining the bodies.
Special air intake with a negative pressure may be appropriate in some medical and refrigeration settings.
Samples should be treated with Biosafety Level 3 safety guidelines.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be classified and placed in separate waiting areas depending on whether there are suspicions of COVID-19. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for those working at a distance of 6 ft from patients known, or suspected, of having the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and those who are engaged in aerosol-construction processes.
In the United States, N95 respirators that are NIOSH-approved or better face masks must be used as a form of complete written respiratory protection, including fitness tests, exercise, and medical tests.
Some types of respirators can be more protective and improve the well-being of the worker. WHO does not recommend covertalls, since COVID-19 is a bloodborne disease rather than a fluid-borne one.
WHO only recommends surgical masks for workers who filter at entry points.
For those who collect odor samples, care for, or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol-based procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, glasses, or face shields, gauges, and gloves.
When aerosol is manufactured, the surgical mask is replaced with a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Because there is insufficient access to PPE in the world, WHO is encouraging to reduce the need for PPE by communicating with patients by telephone, practical barriers such as window sliding, allowing only those directly involved in treatment to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, only using the PPE needed for a specific job, continuing to use the same respirator without removing it while treating multiple patients with the same disease, monitoring and controlling the availability of PPE, and prohibiting the use of masks for people experiencing symptoms of the disease.

PATHELINE: [Covid-19] Reducing burden and preparing for the future
Date and time of the meeting: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
License: CC0: No rights reserved
We find ourselves in a remarkable situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear how connected people around the world are to one another and how we owe each other a responsibility.
We have never faced such challenges, but we know that our response depends on the kind of compassion in the world, the kind of cooperation, and the social structure that is the core of this organization.
The cooperation and care we have seen in all our employees through e-mails, phone calls, and interviews is a remarkable guarantee that we have good people we are lucky enough to work with.
I am truly happy and proud to work with you.
Last week, someone told me how much he appreciated our work.
It reminded me how reasonable it is for the world to be able to open Wikipedia right now, and this is a powerful sign of this key resource to be always available online and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, whether you keep sites open or our employees are paid or our communities are protected.
The world needs the information found on Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is the time when not only what we do but also how we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this work and your role in it, we will make major changes in the way we deal with one another, starting next week.
Changes in our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team c met last night to discuss how we would work out our schedule for the coming days and months.
In that discussion, we considered what we felt would be a positive response to our situation and the best way to keep the organization going during this time.
We were not expecting to take the stress off and support our long-term goal.
If you need to call again, fine.
For all employees, contractors and contractors:
our expected daily work will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until the change is announced.
We do not promote holidays - if you can work extra hours, the company can use you.
However, the world is uncertain now, and whether you need to care for your loved ones, buy food, or see a doctor, your health comes first to us.
We will not track your time.
If you are sick, you are out of work.
We don't really need to say this, but we will.
You do not need to include sick dates or PTO - you will simply tell your manager and help your team to reorganize calendars and schedules to ensure that key work elements are met.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please tell Bryan during T&C Ops so that T&C can assist with support and ensure that your condition is properly treated by the authorities).
Full-time workers will be paid full-time.
We have already said, and we are happy to fulfill our obligations to our contracted and hourly workers.
Each will be paid according to his normal hours of work under normal circumstances.
This includes when you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use work as a way to make their stress adjust to the environment.
Our actions can be rewarding in a special way, especially in times like this.
Again, it is important to take care of yourself.
We invite you to contact your manager, so that we can know what to expect and plan accordingly.
One work is considered important.
There are things we must keep on doing.
The teams of SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising (among others) are carrying out a critical work that may need additional support.
We will begin the process with each department to review current goals and shift our focus to supporting what is important to our goal.
We all have a lot to do, we will all focus on the most important projects.
Slowing down now will not hurt us later.
We do not always work overtime to keep a schedule after the pandemic has passed.
You will not be expected to work overtime to finish work at an unusual time.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and times where appropriate.
What happens to the APP (Annual Planning)?
To adapt to our new conditions and the expected daily work hours, we intend to change the period of delivery of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.
Our aim is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 program that allows more time to budget to allow employees to do critical tasks first, take care of themselves, and care for their loved ones while helping those who need or wish to work a reduced schedule over the next few weeks.
This extension of the work period greatly reduces the work now scheduled and the pressure on the whole organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and review the representatives and teams for the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the APP team for leading this effort.
Office condition, exposure, and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our SF employees may have contracted COVID-19.
However, with great concern, we have sent a disinfectant team to remove germs from all the office locations in San Francisco.
Use hospital disinfectant soap to remove germs everywhere, as well as in the reception area and the elevator areas that enter the area.
The building uses its maintenance protocol through products that support the safety of its tents.
We feel comfortable that the office will be ready when we decide to return to it.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all employees in DC.
Since last week, our DC office has moved to a remote location that has been set up entirely in line with the guidance given to San Francisco.
As some of our employees in New York City know, we have been discussing renting a place in Brooklyn.
These conversations continue but may take time.
Some of our employees work remotely for the first time.
Our longtime remote workers know that this could be a big change, and they want to give you advice:
Reduce the length of meetings to at least one or two hours.
If long meetings are needed, consider how you can divide them into several days.
Make clear what the meeting is about, have an agenda, and send out the material to be read ahead of time.
Do it regularly with video, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to work and communicate live.
Have someone take the lead in arranging all meetings, someone to look at the questions in the discussions and follow up the list of speakers, and someone to help write notes (or write notes together).
Email technical support if you need a good headset.
Use your social security funds to buy a bribe.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to discuss the assignment with your colleagues
The HR Operations team seeks guidance from online seminars on effective ways to support the expansion of the work being sent across the Company.
Last week we asked all the public fundraisers to cancel public events sponsored by Wikimedia, such as editathons, until the WHO declared the epidemic over.
We will tell them that we have understood that our request to cancel and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete their agreed mortgage obligations and that no one will be fined for delaying or changing those terms.
Next week we will follow up with further guidance on Wikimania and other provincial and regional public conferences.
The common feeling among the world's society seems to be a disillusionment with disruption but a freedom with clarity and opportunities to focus on their communities, Wikipedia and so on.
In time, CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a public space to view the contributions and follow our discussions with them.
Staying up to date on COVID-19-related news
We will send an invitation to your calendars next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share some updates, answer your questions, and spend some time communicating.
We work together and will help you wherever we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to receive information on this email, and all other relevant COVID-19 information, from Office Wiki.
The CRT will keep these pages updated and all the information in one place.
We also work to maintain regular contact with workers living in countries currently most affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, the route of a major work, the college challenge, or anything else you may need help with, please do not hesitate to tell and work with CRT.
We are here to help with support and communication when needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please email Bryan Judan - Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be considered as a departure from our job or responsibilities.
Rather, they recognize that during this time, our work and responsibilities will likely need to be harmonized more than ever before.
These steps, they believe, are necessary to support one another to carry on the work, to provide our team with the needed support, and to provide the land with the service in which you depend.
The work we have planned will be waiting for us when the time comes.
Meanwhile, it is time to support one another and to create space for important work that may be available in the weeks and months ahead.
We need all of you to make that happen, so we need all of you to take care of yourself and your families so that you are fully prepared when the need arises.
Now, please -- wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Catherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
B'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that sits outside (in the cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 fights the action of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang(1-7) making it a promising drug for treating heart disease and blood disorders. ACE2 also acts as a cell-infecting agent in certain coronaviruses.
The human type of enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme found on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and the C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-stranded, type I membrane protein, whose domain is activated by enzymes that are secreted on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The outer cell domain of ACE2 is separated from the transmembrane domain by an enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting solute protein is excreted from the blood and eventually into the urine.
ACE2 is present in many body structures: ACE2 is associated with the cell membrane of mainly type II alveolar cells, small intestinal enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and smooth arterial tissue cells in many body structures.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE balance.
ACE divides the angiotensin I hormone into the vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 separates the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and divides it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also isolate several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the flow of the membrane of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 acts as a primary entry point into certain coronavirus cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-causing virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 causing virus).
Specifically, the association of the SARS-CoV spike protein S1 and SARS-CoV2 in the ACE2 enzyme domain on the cell surface results in endocytosis and the transfer of both the virus and the enzyme to the intercellular endosomes.
This entry also requires the activation of S protein by serine protease TMPRSS2, an inhibitor currently under investigation as a potential cure for disease. This has led some to conclude that reducing levels of ACE2 in cells may help fight the virus.
However, many leading organizations and working bodies have promoted continued use of the common ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
"A systematic review and analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that ""the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34 percent decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls"""
"Moreover, ""the risk of pneumonia has been reduced for patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart disease".
"The use of ACE inhibitors has also been linked to a decrease in pneumonia deaths, although the effects were less severe than the damage caused by pneumonia".
The human compound ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a novel treatment for severe lung damage, and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics in oxygen release in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Half of rhACE2 in humans takes 10 hours to work and begins to work 30 minutes later than the 24-hour working time.
Some studies suggest that rhACE2 may be a suitable drug for those who cannot take the common renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases where the predictive angiotensin II is elevated.
"B'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to help find numbers about the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, such as a process for identifying people (""contacts"") who may have had contact with a person infected".
Several programs have been developed or considered, with the support of governmental law in some areas.
Keyframework has been developed to build mobile search apps.
Concerns have been raised about privacy, especially regarding systems based on tracking the location of app users.
Other methods that do not require confidential information include using Bluetooth signals to place the user in other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would develop a platform to support such Bluetooth apps directly on Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has developed an app that allows citizens to check for contacts with people with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 cities in China.
"The app was developed by local IT staff, released as an open source and will be provided by the government. In North Macedonia, the ""StopKorona!"" app was released, a Bluetooth-enabled app to track exposure to potential infected people and provide immediate response from health authorities".
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"On April 12, the government said that the human tracking app was in advanced development, and would be available for download in a few weeks. A similar app is being developed in Ireland, and France (""StopCovid"")."
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on the Singaporean TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to develop an app that shows when a person crosses the restrictions set for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, has listed several potential problems with app systems, including misleading alerts and the possibility of not receiving a warning if the app's power is limited to a small number of people.
"To address concerns about the spread of deceptive or dangerous ""coronavirus"" apps, Apple has placed restrictions on the types of organizations that can install coronavirus apps on its App Store, saying that they will only be ""legal"" or trusted organizations".
Google and Amazon have set the same limits.
Privacy partners have expressed concern about the problems of tracking crowds using coronavirus apps, especially about the fact that the tracking system developed to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be terminated once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement limiting this type of search.
These organizations have set nine criteria for government projects:
"the search must be ""legal, necessary and appropriate"";"
the extension of the surveillance and surveillance period shall be subject to sunset conditions;
data use will be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
data security and anonymity will need to be protected and demonstrated as protected on the basis of evidence;
digital testing will avoid reducing the evils of racism and underestimating the value of things;
any sharing of data with other persons shall be legally defined;
there shall be a vigilance against abuse and citizens' rights to respond to abuse;
"a useful participation by all ""participants"" will be required, including public health professionals and small groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also released checklists".
The proposed Google/Apple program aims to fix the constant tracking problem by removing the search function from the device's OS when it is no longer needed.
Some countries have adopted network-based search rather than apps, eliminating both the need to download an app and avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was authorized.
Network-based solutions that have access to unfiltered location data can have serious privacy issues.
However, not all systems with large servers need to gain access to personal location data; a number of privacy systems have been developed using large servers to communicate only (see section below).
In South Korea, an app-based system was used to track a person.
Instead of using a designated app, the system collects tracking information from a variety of sources including mobile device tracking data and card shopping data, and combines this to send text message alerts to people who may be infected.
In addition to using this information to warn people of potential infections, the government has also made local information available to the public, which is allowed due to many changes in privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is made available to the public through apps and websites. Countries including Germany have considered using both large and privacy systems.
As of 6 April 2020, no details have been released.
Privacy tracking is a well-designed approach, with many research papers dating back to at least 2013. Since April 7, 2020, more than 12 teams of experts have been looking for privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to connect the user with other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinating effort that includes both major and diverse methods, and is not a single protocol.Different protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN,fka Contact Event Numbers,CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, physical human data never leaves the device, and all matching takes place on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has been developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy strategies when collecting and using location or data as a shortcut to tracking the COVID-19 outbreak.
"Based on research from the white paper ""Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic"" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform for Enigma MPC, a privacy technology company first developed at MIT Media Lab".
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive local and health data with other users and law enforcement, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the global TCN Coalition was formed by groups united by what was once a common and very different protocol, with the goal of reducing divisions, and allowing global use of tracking and warning apps, an important factor in widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the government of Singapore announced that it had launched an invitation to the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a tracking system, and claimed to protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography that protects privacy.
They also published features of the technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be released in three stages:
releasing tools to allow governments to create official coronavirus tracking apps that protect privacy
the installation of this feature directly on the iOS and Android systemsGoogle and Apple to fix startup and ongoing monitoring issues by first sending the system with OS updates, and later removing it in the same way once the threat has passed.
Drug repositioning (also known as reuse of a drug, re-profiling, re-tasking, or therapeutic switching) is the reuse of an approved drug to treat another disease or health condition different from the one for which it was designed.
This is the kind of scientific research that is currently being done to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research guidelines include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drug-using proteins, each with multiple molecular junction sites.
Analysis of these sites of interaction produced a logical project to develop an antibacterial agent against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important proteins considered for SARS-CoV-2 are proteases such as papain, RNA-based RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A A, and others research several potential drugs and then develop and analyze their structural similarities with similar high-level authorized drugs to accelerate the development of a potent drug to treat SARS-CoV-2 in this pre-clinical study that could be used as a research drug.
Chloroquine is a malaria drug that is also used for certain immune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among four drugs being studied as part of the Joint Medical Research.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the New York State's study of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA approved the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
This treatment has not yet been approved by the FDA's medical research system and is only approved under the EUA as an investigational treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive medical research treatment.
"The CDC has said ""the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine in prophylaxis or treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 virus"" is not appropriate".
"Doctors have said they use the drug when there is ""no other option"""."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major research is underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
The NYU Langone Medical School conducts research into the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine to prevent disease.
"A Chinese medical study in Wuhan and Shenzhen says that favipiravir appears to be ""really effective"."
35 patients in Shenzhen were found to be negative in the test within 4 days, while the duration of the illness was 11 days for 45 patients who did not get it.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 pneumonia patients, half were given favipiravir and half were given umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that there is little evidence to support the drug and that it is still in use.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy a drug from Japan and stockpile it, and then use the military to ship the drug to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has introduced himself to Trump's council about buying the drug.
It may not be safe to use it by pregnant women or when trying to conceive.
"One study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that ""no benefit was found"."
These drugs were designed to prevent HIV from multiplying by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to change the drugs to find a fluid that will bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are critics in the scientific community who are directing efforts to reuse drugs specifically designed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO has included lopinavir/ritonavir in a global Joint Study.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a drug to treat the Ebola virus and Marburg diseases. Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir had vitro-antimicrobial activity against the philo-, pneumonia-, paramyxo-, and corona- viruses.
One problem with antibiotics is to develop a method of treatment with mutations that can lead to a serious and contagious disease.
Early research suggests that remdesivir may have a high inhibitory gene for drug dysfunction. Several medical studies are ongoing, including two conducted at Cleveland University Hospitals; one for moderate and one for severe illnesses.
There are three ongoing clinical trials for vitamin C injections for hospitalized and critically ill people with COVID-19; two fake medicines (in China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (in Italy).
The State of New York began a trial of the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a medical study of Tejin's Alvesco (ciclesonide), a corticosteroid that is a reversible asthma agent, to treat patients with no symptoms of the new coronavirus virus.
Phase II angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 research is ongoing with 200 patients who will be treated from the worst of conditions, hospitalized in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to test the efficacy of this treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently investigating the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung problems in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
A study, called COLCORONA, included 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and had few symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Pregnant or breastfeeding women or those without effective contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used in treating patients, leading the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines for its use.
A multi-institutional study of 300 patients investigating the use of sodium enoxaparin in vaccines for disease prevention and treatment was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists have focused heavily on reusing antiviral drugs that had been developed by previous outbreaks such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with Chinese guideline schedule 7
Umifenovir:umifenovir was proposed for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with Chinese guideline plan 7
Some antibiotics that have been found to be reusable in treating COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Authorized in China.
In the study also in Italy and China. and see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The b'A COVID-19 target is a planned target against the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).
Although no goal has been reached yet, many efforts are underway to achieve such a goal.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect the vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes it, to be available in less than 18 months.
Five candidates for vaccination were in Phase I of the safety study in April.
COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to a massive fundraising and research effort to establish the target.
Many organizations are using genetics to develop feasible vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.
Since April, the core components of CEPI's policy-making work are fast-paced, dismantled, produced, and accessible worldwide.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms have been researched and developed in early 2020 to develop a practical policy against COVID-19.
The main platform projects that have advanced in Phase I security research include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Founder of Phase I and target candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (the founder of Phase I and the candidate for the goal: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 candidates are in the early stages of formulating the policy, while 78 have been confirmed as viral projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 have been announced, but very little public information is available (which may be planned or being developed).
Phase II studies investigate pre-use safety and antimicrobial, usually planned, controlled by a fake drug, and in many facilities, while considering more accurate, effective doses.
Phase III studies usually involve additional participants, including a control group, and the implementation of a policy test to prevent disease, while evaluating critical results with the appropriate dosage.
"Of the 79 proposed target candidates (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet tested in humans (in a ""pre-treatment"" study)."
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland in Australia announced that it was investigating the use of a molecular clamp to convert viral proteins into genes for treatment.
On 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of the policy work, with the aim of starting human trials in 2021.
The project to build the target was announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020, at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, headed by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that it had begun the work of establishing the policy.
Janssen also establishes a drinking regimen with his partner, Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced the establishment of a partnership with Vaxart to establish the goal.
On February 8, 2020, OncoGen's laboratory in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine with technology similar to that used in cancer treatment using new immunosuppressants.
On March 25 the director of the research center announced that he had reached conclusions on a mixture of principles and that the examination was underway.
On 27 February 2020, Generex's future subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it is launching a vaccine project to develop the ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
"They wanted to produce a target that could be tested in humans ""in 90 days""".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its plans to establish a goal.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were establishing a target.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had partnered with Novavax Inc.
setting and setting a goal.
The partners also announced plans for pre-clinical trials and Phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Health Ministry of India announced that it is working with 11 social distancing people, and even how fast it can take at least a year and a half to two years to establish a target.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company based in Quebec City, Quebec, reported that coronavirus-like particles had been developed under a small grant from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The candidate for the goal is being studied by a laboratory, and the human test is scheduled for July or August 2020.
"Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had given CureVac ""a 'huge sum of money' to develop a Covid-19 policy"", and the German government opposed it".
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to develop a joint goal of mRNA.
The mRNA target BNT162, currently being tested for pre-treatment use and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, a biotechnology company, announced that it will receive pre-clinical test results in April 2020 and its final goal is to begin testing on humans in the fall.
In France on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a combined COVID-19 cure research involving the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of CEPI in developing a COVID-19 cure to US$29 million.
Other CEPI partners who have invested in setting up the COVID-19 policy are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing animals for six different targets.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they had developed a self-testing RNA target for COVID-19.
The goal was set within 14 days of the goal being reached in China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced $275 million to fund 96 research projects on COVID-19 treatments, including several projects for Canadian companies and universities, such as projects in the University of Saskatchewan and the University of Chicago.
"At about the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically for the establishment of a COVID-19 policy, with plans to establish a national ""regulatory bank"" of several new policies that can be applied in the event of another coronavirus outbreak".
"On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on a trial of PittCoVacc, a vaccine for COVID-19 in mice, and also stated that ""MNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 S1 must produce the effects of a strong antibody response in [mice] within 2 weeks of receipt of the vaccine"".
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based protocol that could be used to inject a nasal spray.
Using therapeutic bacteria, DNA will be made to produce harmless particles such as viruses, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, three US industries, and three universities combined to acquire IBM's large-scale computers, combined with cloud computing from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some goals have implications for other organisms, also called ambiguous results.
That means that it can have the same effects as the disease that prevents us.
One random survey in Australia calls for enrollment of 4,170 health workers.
The goals that are set may not be safe or effective.
The first study to evaluate the effectiveness of the policy using animal models of COVID-19, such as ACE2-inserted mice, other laboratory animals, and human-like animals, shows the need for three-step protection efforts in the management of viruses, and international cooperation to ensure safe and effective procedures everywhere.
The SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested on nonhuman animal models.
As of 2020, no cure or policy for SARS has been proven safe and effective for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the discovery and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a key concern for governments and public health agencies worldwide.
When MERS spread, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for establishing targets and treatments for the MERS-CoV virus.
As of March 2020, there has been one (DNA) MERS target that completed phase I of clinical research in humans, and three others are under investigation, and all are viral-vector, adeno-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) two, and MVA-vector one (MVA-MERS-S) targets.
Social media posts promote the idea that the virus that causes COVID-19 is known and that the goal is already being achieved.
Patents cited in various social media posts refer to existing patents for gene sequences and to patents for other coronavirus relatives such as SARS coronavirus.
The 2019 b'Coronavirus virus (COVID-19) is a contagious virus caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms of the disease include fever, cough, and diarrhea.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of breath, and stomach pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually five days but can range from two to fourteen days.
While most cases result in symptoms, some result in widespread pneumonia and death of many organs.
Since April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in the deaths of more than 153,000 people.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread among people who have contacted, often through tiny droplets that come out when you cough, vomit, or speak.
Although these droplets come out when you breathe, they often fall on the floor or on objects rather than being bacteria over long distances.
People may also become infected by touching the infected area and then touching the eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive for up to 72 hours.
It is most commonly transmitted within the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although it can spread before symptoms appear and in later stages of the virus.
The use of masks is encouraged for those suspected of being infected and their caregivers.
The recommendations for the general public to wear a mask vary, with some authorities saying they should not be used, others saying they should not be used, and others insisting that it be used.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or treatment for COVID-19.
Transmissions of the virus have been detected in many countries in all six WHO regions.
Those infected may not have symptoms of illness or have symptoms of fever, fever, fatigue, and diarrhea.
Signs of emergency disease include shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or stress, confusion, difficulty getting up, and facial and lip bruising; seeking medical attention is encouraged as soon as these symptoms become apparent.
Rarely, symptoms of upper respiratory distress such as dizziness, tingling, or sore throat may appear.
Signs of disease in the oral-to-hip tract such as nausea, diarrhea, and cough have been noted in varying percentages.
Some incidents in China initially only caused a hardening of the chest and a strong heartbeat.
In some, the disease can spread to pneumonia, kill many organs, and kill.
This is also called the period of onset of symptoms.
The period of onset of symptoms of COVID-19 is usually five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection develop symptoms, and reports show that not all infected individuals develop symptoms.
The role of those without symptoms in transmitting the disease to others is not fully understood; however, current evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the virus.
The number of people infected with the virus who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and is still being investigated, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all those infected have been without symptoms while hospitalized.
China's National Health Commission began including cases of no-symptom cases in its daily statistics on April 1; of the 166 cases that day, 130 (78%) had no symptoms when tested.
Both cough and fever can carry the virus.
Speaking out loud produces several drops more than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without a cover can lead to constipation up to 4.5 meters (15 ft).
Although the virus is not usually transmitted through the air, the National Academy of Science has suggested that it can be transmitted through the mouth and that air stores in corridors outside human rooms have produced negative samples of the RNA virus.
Certain medical procedures such as tube and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause the production of particles to be released into the air and result in the spread of seizures.
Although there is concern that it may spread through the wastewater, the risk is thought to be minimal. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although the outbreak may occur before the symptoms appear, the risk is minimal.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not yet fully understood how easily the virus can spread, one person usually infects two or three people.
Specifically, the virus was found to live one day on cardboard, about three days on plastic (polypropylene) and metal (AISI 304), and about four hours on 99% clay.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap can also be effective if used properly; soap products reduce the protective layer of bacterial oil, kill it, and remove it from the skin and other areas.
Some soaps, such as benzonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (an antibiotic for surgical facilities), are not effective.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed a high viral load, and the sixth patient showed a high viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first reported in three people with pneumonia and later linked to many of the most serious respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are derived from coronavirus.
When it is outside the human body, the virus is killed by a household soap, which blows up its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most vulnerable to COVID-19 because the virus enters the main cells via an enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is found in large quantities in type II alveolar cells in the lungs.
"The virus uses a special glycoprotein called a ""spike"" (peplomer) to communicate with ACE2 and enter the main cell".
Severe heart damage was found in 12% of the infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is most common in serious illnesses.
The levels of cardiovascular disease symptoms are high, causing inflammation of the immune system and disease during the course of the disease, but a severe heart attack may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.
The incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) has been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 viruses and may be related to poor prognosis.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism of ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells have been found to be associated with the discovery of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and the causes of severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported in autopsies.
The WHO has published several protocols for testing the virus.
The most common test method is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Tests are usually performed on breathing samples obtained from a nasal swab; however, a nasal swab or a sputum sample can also be used.
Results are usually obtained within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests may be used, but this requires two blood samples taken within two weeks and the results are of little value at that time.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a portion of the coronavirus and publish a sequence of components so that laboratories around the world can develop their own polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the virus for disease.
From 4 April 2020, the testing of pathogens (which can detect active viruses and whether a person has been infected with the virus) was introduced, but has not yet been widely used.
Chinese surveys show that the accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first clinical trial on March 21, 2020, which was used later that month. The identification guidelines issued by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested ways to diagnose the virus based on treatment features and risk of disease control.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities spread peripherally, asymmetrically and posteriorly are common in the bacterial penetration.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickness with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may occur as the disease progresses.
Little data is available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main causes found in the study are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, lung consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of complications of pneumonia can be identified:
common pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multi-nucleated giant cell formation
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
curable pneumonia: a combination of exudates in the alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying indoors, avoiding crowded areas, washing your hands with soap and water often for about 20 seconds, getting used to clean mouth and nose, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends closing the mouth and nosing with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the thigh when tissue is absent.
Proper hand washing after coughing or diarrhea is encouraged.
The CDC encourages the use of face coverings in public, in part to reduce infection from people without symptoms of the virus. Social distancing strategies are designed to reduce contact with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, banning movement, and cancelling large gatherings.
Distance guidelines also include keeping people at least six feet (1.8 m) apart.
"There is no known effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19. With the goal not expected until at least 2021, the best way to control COVID-19 is to try to reduce the number of cases, which is called ""to make the line flat"."
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands appear unclean, before eating and after coughing, coughing, and wheezing.
It also recommends the use of hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content, but only if soap and water are not readily available.
In these methods, the antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; ""it is not a disinfectant in hand washing equipment"."
Glycerol is added to create moisture.
People are treated with care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygenation, and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of having the virus wear a normal face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to solve the respiratory failure problem, but its benefits are still being considered.
Cleanliness, health, and healthy eating have been promoted to prevent infection.
Physical therapy can help those who have mild symptoms of the virus who have recently contracted the virus.
Intensive care physicians and pulmonologists in the U.S. have combined treatments from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no cure for COVID-19.
When symptoms of illness appear, some doctors recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen.
Measures must be taken to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus from one person to another, especially in medical facilities where aerosol-producing procedures, such as intubation or hand ventilation, are performed.
For doctors caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC encourages the keeping of people in the Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to the usual measures, preventing contact and smelling the virus.
Equipment: PPE gauge, respirator or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. When available, respirators (instead of face masks) are recommended.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use but the FDA has approved masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust but protection from a specific body agent is not guaranteed in their use.
If no masks are available, the CDC recommends using face shields or, if no other option, artificial masks.
Most COVID-19 conditions are not too severe to require mechanical ventilation or other procedures, but some do.
The type of respiratory support for people with respiratory problems related to COVID-19 is still being studied by people in hospitals, and there is some evidence that intubation can be avoided with high nasal cannula flow or bi-level positive airway pressure.
Whether these two results in the same benefit for seriously ill people is unknown.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation if available because this method reduces the spread of the blood cells as compared to high nasal flow.
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds, which reduces the number of people receiving treatment and causes a sudden increase in the number of people with severe COVID-19 who need hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% were hospitalized, 2.3% needed ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30 percent of people in hospital with COVID-19 end up in the ICU.
Ventilation systems are becoming more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops from COVID-19 and breathing becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators with pressure control modes and high PEEP are needed to increase oxygen availability while reducing the risk of lung injury associated with ventilators and the pneumothorax.
PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.
Research on treatment options began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are undergoing clinical research.
Remdesivir seems to be the one that will work.
While new drugs may still be developed by 2021, several drugs under review are already approved for other uses or have already been developed for testing.
Antibiotics can be tried on people with a serious infection.
WHO encourages volunteers to participate in research into the efficacy and safety of medicines for medical use. FDA has temporarily approved convalescent plasma as a treatment for infectious diseases.
It does not include the necessary medical research to prove its safety and efficacy in treating disease.
In February 2020, a mobile app was launched in China to handle the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter a name and ID number.
The app can detect 'close contact' by using trace data that could be a risk of infection.
All users can check the status of three other users.
When a potentially dangerous situation is detected, the app not only encourages isolation but also warns health authorities. Large amounts of data analysis with mobile data, facial recognition technology, cell phone tracking and advanced information are being used to track down people infected with the virus and those who have contacted them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track cell phone data of suspected coronavirus cases.
This is done to keep them out of the public eye and to protect those who may have contact with infected residents.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared telephone location data with the German government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has developed facial recognition technology to detect those who violate social distancing laws.
"Italy's provincial health official Giulio Gallera said he was told by mobile phone workers that ""40% of the population is still walking around"."
The German government held a 48-hour computer hacking competition for 42,000 participants over the weekend.
The president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, has made a national announcement of solutions to contain the coronavirus outbreak.
People may experience stress from isolation, restrictions on movement, adverse medical effects, or fear of infection itself.
"The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, ""Continuous social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, depression, and economic collapse are a storm that is damaging people's minds and their well-being".""
The virus may have a few or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Common cases have been cured within two weeks, while those infected with a serious or serious virus may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of contracting the serious COVID-19 virus based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data on COVID-19 is lacking.
For those most affected, COVID-19 can quickly spread to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory damage, septic shock, or multiple organ deaths.
COVID-19-related problems include sepsis, abnormal clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Clotting abnormalities, especially increased prothrombin time, were found in 6% of those hospitalized due to COVID-19, while renal dysfunction was seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death is ten days, and five are spent in the hospital.
However, patients admitted to the ICU have about seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an initial case study, the average time from the onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, a total of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the death rate for men is 2.8% while the death rate for women is 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of samples of cadaver lungs show diffuse alveolar damage and cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were seen in the pneumocytes.
A picture of the butterfly showed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission in China, heart damage was noted by high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data from March in the United States, 89 percent of those hospitalized were already sick.
The mortality rate from the virus varies because of these differences in regions, but also because of the complexity of the methods used.
A few very bad conditions can cause the death rate to exceed the expected.
However, the fact that death is the result of past cases of the virus may mean that the death rate is now low.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to receive emergency care or die compared to non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority has found a 20 to 30 percent decrease in the function of the lungs of some patients who have recovered from the injury, and lung masks indicate that it may have been damaged.
This can also lead to a thumb injury after critical care after recovery.
In March 2020, it was unknown whether the previous virus could help in effective and long-term protection of recovering individuals in the genital area.
Protection from the virus seems possible, based on other coronavirus, but cases have been reported where recovery from COVID-19 has been followed by positive coronavirus tests later.
These conditions are thought to be the proliferation of the virus, not the re-infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and to have originated from animals and then spread to humans.
The exact origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the virus was almost entirely controlled by human-to-human transmission.
A study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in the Lancet, showed that the first day of outbreak of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO records reported that the first symptoms of the disease appeared on 8 December 2019.
Several methods are widely used to count the deaths.
These numbers vary by region and time and depend on the level of testing, the quality of the medical system, the treatment options, the time since the first outbreak and human factors such as age, sex, and health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned emergency virus codes to ICD-10, U07.1 killed by laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 virus and U07.2 killed by COVID-19 identified by medical and analytical experts without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 virus. The death rate over the virus indicates the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases during a given period.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the worldwide death rate of the virus is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which indicates the percentage of confirmed deaths from the virus, and infection fatality rate (IFR), which indicates the percentage of people infected (identified and unidentified) who die from the virus.
These figures are not based on time and follow the number of individuals from infection to resolution of the case.
While not all infected individuals have pathogens, the presence of pathogens can provide information about how many people are infected.
In Italy's most infected region, Castiglione d'Adda, a small community of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the virus spread to Carnival parties, and it spread to youths, causing low death rates, and not all COVID-19 deaths are legally recognized as viral.
Moreover, Germany's health care system is not yet overpriced.
In the Netherlands, about 3 percent are likely to have a disease, as blood vendors surveyed.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The epidemic's cause and mortality rate vary from man to woman.
The death toll is higher than that of men in a study conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is at age 50, and the gap between men and women is only 90 years.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for these differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the cause.
The difference in sex-based infection rates, the low rate of female smokers and men who develop other medical conditions such as hypertension at a young age than women can contribute to the higher death rate among men.
In Europe, 57 percent of those infected were men and 72 percent of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track sex-related data of COVID-19 cases.
Studies show that communicable diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
The majority of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the flu.
"The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the virus will be ""COVID-19"""."
WHO Prime Minister Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI stands for virus, D stands for disease, and 19 stands for the year of the first outbreak: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid naming a specific region (such as China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with various countries' suggestions in the design to prevent discrimination.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
"WHO also uses the terms ""COVID-19 virus"" and ""COVID-19 virus"" in public discussions".
"Both the disease and the virus are often called ""coronavirus"."
"Among the first outbreaks in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often called ""coronavirus"" and ""Wuhan coronavirus"""."
In January 2020, WHO suggested 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as the names to be used for the virus and disease in accordance with the 2015 guidelines against using sites in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Because of the shortage of manufacturing equipment, some digital equipment manufacturers print medical equipment such as vacuum cleaners and ventilator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve, and the supplier could not deliver it on time, a local company used its machines and printed 100 needed valves in one night.
After the first outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, fictional, misleading stories about the origin, spread, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and quickly spread on the Internet.
Humans seem to be able to transmit the virus to other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of infection of pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is no approved medicine or policy for treating the disease.
International research on COVID-19 policies and medicines is conducted by government agencies, school groups, and industry researchers.
"In March, the World Health Organization launched a ""Combined Study"" to evaluate the effectiveness of four existing antiviral drugs with high potential for efficacy".
There is no vaccine anymore, but various agencies are working to develop vaccines.
The previous SARS-CoV function is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination options are being studied.
First, researchers aim to develop a vaccine against the virus.
The purpose of using such a virus, dead or dead, is to establish a body response to the new COVID-19 virus.
The second method, subunit vaccines, aims to establish a policy that causes the immune system to respond to certain aspects of the virus.
If it is SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on an S-spike protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third method is the nucleic acid target (DNA or RNA targets, a new method of targeting).
The clinical trials for any of these methods will have to be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The goal is to contain a harmless genetic code copied from the disease-causing genome. Development based on disease genes has been suggested as a challenge to the development of the SARS-COV-2 goal, but this has not been confirmed.
There are over 300 medical studies underway since April 2020.
Seven studies examined approved malaria treatments, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Recycled antiviral drugs make up the bulk of the research in China, and nine Phase III remdesivir trials in several countries will report in late April.
A robust review of the medical development of the COVID-19 vaccine and medicines for treatment had begun, in April 2020. Several available antiviral drugs are being studied in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
There has been tangible evidence of remdesivir's efficacy, in March 2020.
Progress in patient care has been seen in adequate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was tested in China in February 2020, and unapproved results emerged.
However, it is suggested that the results of the research be examined.
Health officials in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that twice that dose is too high and can be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA approved the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in emergency situations as prescribed by doctors treating people with COVID-19.
Unapproved data indicate that higher doses of ribavirin are needed for in vitro prevention of SARS-CoV-2.
Nitzoxanide has been proposed in ongoing vivo studies after showing a weak inhibitory effect for SARS-CoV-2. Research suggests that the initial elevation of protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is critical for SARS-CoV-2 entry through contact with the ACE2 inhibitor.
Research on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine along with or without azithromycin has significant limitations that prevent the medical community from receiving this treatment without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has an unknown role in treating COVID-19.
Cytokine storm can be a problem in the latest stages of the most severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storms. Tocilizumab has been added to the guidelines for treatment by China's National Health Commission after a small study was completed.
A phase 2 randomized national trial was conducted in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe illness.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests for cytokine storms, it is designed to prevent this from happening, which is thought to be the cause of death for some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on a previous study in the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by various factors, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no random, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of clean and powerful immune-produced pathogens of those recovering from COVID-19 to those who need them is being investigated as a means of reducing the need for immunization.
This method has been tried on SARS and the results are unknown.
Viral neutralisation is a predictable technique used where treatment with pathogenic agents may create protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other methods, such as cellular cytotoxicity based on disease patterns and/ or phagocytosis, are possible.
Alternative therapies for pathogens, for example, using pathogens with similar cell types, are being developed.
The production of convalescent serum, which contains a fluid from recovered patients and contains disease-related components, can be increased to speed up use.
Coronavirus, a group of closely related diseases
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan's Central Hospital, later contracted the virus and died of COVID-19 after helping raise awareness about the spread of the virus.
