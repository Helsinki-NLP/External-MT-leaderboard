Not only does this confirm the now widely held theory that at least some dinosaurs were crushed, but it also provides details about what fossils generally could not be, including color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's fur was chestnut brown on top, pale or carotenoid on the bottom.
The find also provides a detailed look at the evolution of birds' feathers.
Since the feather of a dinosaur does not have a well-developed cartilage called the rachis, but has other features of the feathers  horns and beams , scientists have concluded that the rachis probably evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature control or courtship, according to the scientists, although the tail is that of a young dinosaur, the feathers of an adult are shown in the sample and not the feathers of a young one.
Although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the sample is, according to the scientists, an adult's feathers, not a juvenile's flippers.

The work they did was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Milky Way.
The phenomenon the team expected would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on Earth and causes tides and waves, so does the Milky Way on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have found that the interactions of one dark matter with another are the same as those of ordinary matter.

They're colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) astrogeology team, also based at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been low-tech, with voters going to a separate area and inserting a pre-printed piece of paper into an envelope with their candidate's name on it.
Once the officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law has a fairly strict codification of procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of the voting and that no envelopes are added except those that are duly verified and counted by the voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness the entire process.

He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was charged by the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with the murder of his son.
She's in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, however, any eyewitness evidence may be wasted as her appearance has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary works differently, and the courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee argues that "journalists are taking a dangerous turn when they publish photos of suspicious individuals".
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for criminal prosecutions, has indicated to reporters that it will not comment further on the case until at least charges are brought.
The document, according to leaked information, is to address the border demarcation dispute that Palestine is claiming based on the state of the borders before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future state of Jerusalem, which is considered sacred by both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel has a requirement for a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years after the signing of the agreement, while Palestine agrees to maintain such a presence for a period of five years only.
The shooters in the supplementary pest test should have been under the strict supervision of the foresters, as the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and heritage parks at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly took office yesterday with a new nine-member provisional electoral council.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in the last four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the pre-arranged resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the scheme that began in October.
Sometimes, violent protests have been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have taken place since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of faulty iPod overheating, which have caused a total of six fires, with four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving equipment.
Last week, the government agency METI reported that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's reporting delay "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday at 9:19 p.m.
The Office for Emergency Situations in the Northern Mariana Islands stated that no damage was reported in the country.
According to a statement by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there is no indication that a tsunami is coming.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza was shooting tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
The Philippine photographers were accompanied by six hostages, including children and elderly persons, who were released early.
Then the photographers took over the place from an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began his medical career.
He trained as a midwife and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that administering the hormone would accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two flight recorders, known as "black boxes", on Wednesday.
The warrior comrades also gave up their respect for Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first extreme queen. She was my first manager. She died in the night two months, which was like her quite original. She was a strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented, "Luna was as crazy as I am... maybe even more so... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's doing well up there".
From 1,400 people who took part in a survey before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
In the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard communicated her belief that Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of respondents agree that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last Australian monarch.
In extreme polls, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and also swim in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, doubts were raised about his fitness.
He couldn't take the pain medication he needed because it's banned at the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known.
Several people had confirmed the invention using other hardware and software by early February, and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water supplied to the earth, along with organic matter that could produce proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the gossip "political chatter and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, allows aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions every year.
It uses satellite technology as opposed to older technology based on ground radars, which allows air traffic controllers to more accurately identify the aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There is no other form of transport available, there are no overground trains that stop at Wembley, and there are no car parks or park-and-ride facilities.
Concerns over the lack of transportation made it more likely that the match would have to be played behind closed doors, without fans.
On Thursday, the journal Science published a study that reported the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Scientists at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species had evolved within two generations, though it was believed that the process would take much longer, by crossing the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, with the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into many different shapes, such as rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be beaten and twisted into boards.
It can be made very thin and can be glued to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was once used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called a pH chemical, and the indicator can be made using red cabbage juice.
The juice from the cabbage changes color according to how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
The hydrogen ions are protons that have had electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms are one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then form a ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture in your hands will start to react with the outer layers, resulting in a strange feeling and the formation of a shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets connected to a sophisticated sewer system in almost every home.
Remains of the sewer system have been found in the houses of Greek Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were even toilets, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women shared mixed company.
To talk to someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space will receive a call, which it then almost immediately reflects back down to Earth.
Space scientists use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and field of view.
To put a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a huge rocket, over 100 feet high.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways, and the most important thing that the bicycle has brought us is much easier and faster transportation.
This has given us the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are other medium-sized cat-like predators that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
After all, there are many small cats (including wild domestic cats) that eat much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, the specific areas or tasks that each of the beasts has to do, which prevents competition between each other.
Lions are the most social of all feline animals, living in large groups called packs.
The flock consists of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave like wolf packs and dogs, which are remarkably similar in behavior to lions (but not to other feline predators), and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a well-trained athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump for long distances, and pull five times as hard as a powerful man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar, and these four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like a lion's roar with a mighty voice but, rather, like a few harsh words shouted.
Ocelotes love to eat small animals, occasionally catching monkeys, snakes, rodents, or birds, but the vast majority of animals that ocelots hunt are considerably smaller.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and search for animals to eat (prey) by scent and by the scent of the places they have been.
They have excellent night vision and also move very discreetly, hunting their prey by blending in with the surroundings and then pouncing on it.
When a small group of animals (a small population) breaks away from the main population from which they came (such as when they move across a mountain or a river, or when they move to a new island so they don't get back easily), they often end up in an environment that is different from the original one.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be strong competitors, as opposed to what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like members of other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they can't be called the same species.
The name of this process is speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and speciation is the unconditional result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants make food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build our homes, to make our clothes, to make most of the things we eat, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our clothes, to make our food, to make our clothes, to make our clothes, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to be our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to make our food, to our food, to our food, to our life, to our food, to our food, to our life.
Mosasaurus was the tallest predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were embedded with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set of teeth in the weather, which meant there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We're not entirely sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and it may have fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been cannibalistic.
It also attacked anything that went into the water, and even a giant dinosaur like Tyranosaurus rex couldn't match it.
While many of their dishes would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual foods at feasts, including wild boar, peacocks, slugs and a type of rodent called the plach.
Another difference is that poor men and women ate while sitting on chairs, whereas rich men preferred communal feasts, at which they ate while lying on their sides.
Ancient Roman food certainly could not have contained the ingredients that would not reach Europe from America or Asia until centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the deity.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes temples included specially built pyramid-shaped towers called zikkurats.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
The house wasn't that substantial in the warm climate of the Middle East.
For most of their lives, ordinary Hebrew families lived under the stars.
Women cooked in the courtyard, shops were just countertops facing the street, and houses were built of stone.
There were no extensive forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was extremely expensive.
The Scandinavian sagas tell of Erik the Red being banished from Iceland for murder, and traveling further west, he found a new land and named it Greenland.
Despite his discoveries, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are "Scandinavian" countries, there are many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history.
If you've seen the movie, "The Templar's Treasure Hunt", you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence was a map of the treasure.
Even if there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" were written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text is found at the bottom of the document, in italics.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its early days a large parchment document (about 75 by 57 by 62 by 23 centimeters) was rolled up for storage.
It is therefore likely that the record was used only to mark the document.
The Normandy landings and the ensuing battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the "Vichist" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had cooperated with them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned on Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, and this word is related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state, and this also defines the size of society in a way.
The city-states are the ancestors of the nations. Civilized culture entails the transmission of knowledge across several generations, the continuation of a cultural trace and the uniform spread.
Smaller cultures often die out without leaving any relevant historical evidence and therefore cannot be recognized as true civilizations.
The American Revolution created thirteen states, first a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, whose only constituent was Congress.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on the state authorities to enforce all its laws, but they often failed to cooperate.
Nor did it have any authority to rewrite laws on taxation and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often not present.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international events and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the grouping of islands that Japan has, from a geographical point of view, Japan is often considered to be a 'multi-island country'.
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing around recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company builds a base in southwestern Taiwan, begins transforming native grain cultivation practices, and employs Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) gained control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three basic structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings around the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1975 and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for photographs worldwide is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still made today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from digital camera imaging sensors.
It's actually a 35mm format with a surprising width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The ratio of sides of this format, which is divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers, is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS group of formats) equal or approach this aspect ratio.
A very commonly used, but also ridiculed, is the simple rule of thirds, which creates dynamics while maintaining order in the image.
He argues that the most efficient place for the main subject is on the intersection lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church came under scrutiny, becoming rich and powerful.
For more than a millennium, Christianity has brought European countries together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from kings to common people.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's funds should be used for these purposes.
The church had been present as a central authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether its principles were being followed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, as it succeeded in disrupting vital military and civilian supplies, despite the blockade violating generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain conditioned international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, which posed a danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was only a minimal response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, the prevailing attitude among the majority of citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations desired to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter from his manager at his previous job, Charles Batchelor, who had recommended him to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting different periods of time; each historical period of China or each family in power was a dynasty that made its mark on history in a distinctive way.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which existed for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times, a vicious war raged between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, and thousands of people died fighting for supremacy in the great palace of Si-an.
Many social and political phenomena are explored, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from autocracy to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Even after the revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true for the military, because instead of ranking by rank, they've moved to caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond earthly life, and he often went to meditate in the cave that became known as Hira, on Mount Noor (Light).
The cave itself, which has survived for a long time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Lying on top of one of the hills north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to get inside, even if you know where it is, because once you're in a cave, you're completely isolated.
There's nothing to see but a clear, beautiful sky and a number of surrounding mountains, and very little of this world is seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the Giza Necropolis, is located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, and is home to several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Cheops' wives and family members.
The 'stick up' sign looks like a V and the 'stick down' sign looks like a buckle or square without a bottom.
Up means you should start at the tip and push on the string, while down means you should start at the frog's foot (where you hold the string in your hand) and pull with the string.
The top of the bow usually produces a softer sound, while the bottom is firmer and more durable.
You can write down your own notes, but remember that the printed notes are there for musical reasons, so you should usually keep them.
On October 6, 1789, a panic drove King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary Theresa, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, from Versailles back to Paris.
They were driven back to Paris in a chariot, accompanied by an angry mob that shouted threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open until dawn.
At one point, someone in the crowd waved the head of the royal guard that had been beheaded at Versailles to the frightened queen.
The military costs of American imperialism during the occupation of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime in the United States to cover most of the expenses and to channel the interest on the bonds on behalf of the Philippine government through the banking houses on Wall Street.
It is clear that the huge profits made by the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people have been the basic income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context in which the order originated.
The period when these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, the end of which is generally dated to around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of notions from the development of new technologies or technological imperative to its narrow meaning that human destiny is governed by the logic of scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself goes a way that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology "affects" societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be argued that motor vehicles inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network for only a few cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Massive car ownership is also leading to higher rates of road accidents, which is leading to the invention of new medical techniques for healing injured bodies.
An important element of Romanticism was cultural determinism, drawing from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, geography-related customs and culture emerged that were more in tune with society and superior to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is now considered the fashion capital of Europe, Constantinople was during the feudal period.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began sometime around 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its status declined during the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned and brought back gifts such as silk and pearls, and these were valued more than what was offered in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Early clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because of the slow communication channels, the styles in the West may have been 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great achievements of the time, brought by the Crusades, was the button, which was used to fasten clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture carried out for the purpose of producing the quantity of food needed exclusively for the subsistence of the farmer and his family.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses own set seed  originating from an ecoregion  in combination with a seed process or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in self-sufficient agriculture, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be characterised by age, ethnic origin, social class, geographical location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a distinct subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization draws on several unfortunate cases of children who were neglected, unhappy, or intentionally abused and not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Such children are called "unruly" or "savage". Some unruly children have been restrained by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, parents abandoned the child because they could not cope with his severe intellectual or physical disability.
Before being abandoned or fleeing, wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When a feral child is raised only by animals other than human beings, it has behaviors (within physical limits) almost identical to those of a particular animal, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding strategy goes even further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a tool to help people who encounter new experiences in learning, for example using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The solutions can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is also a form of solutions, but it is also a small office tool in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scales are internalized in software, and are primarily designed to challenge and explain procedures that are too difficult for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but it does.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The foster care system is designed to provide the children with everything they need that was missing from the household from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to further possibilities in the use and satisfaction theory.
For example, there is an assumption that learning and socialization are important motivators for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
In researching audience responses to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified personal engagement and persistent relationships as motivating aspects.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions and facial mimicry, which last for only a few milliseconds.
More accurately, it is claimed that correct interpretation of micro-reactions can determine whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his book The President's Speech, showed that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can accurately judge the sincerity of speech.
It even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and visible.
Mutation adds new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the group of variations that have been expressed.
Segregation and recombination mix variations between these two groups with each generation.
On the savanna, primates with a digestive system similar to that of humans have a hard time meeting their need for amino acids from available plant sources.
Failure to do so will have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The easiest available plant sources were probably the proteins found in leaves and beans, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
By contrast, animal food (ant, termite, egg) is not only easily digestible but also provides a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved their protein problem in the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during a normal sleep period and then falling asleep shortly afterwards (1060 minutes).
You can do this simply by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
But if you put off the alarm while you sleep, you can move it to the other side of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm include drinking a large amount of fluids before bedtime (especially water or tea, the famous diuretic), which causes a person to get up and urinate.
The degree of inner peace that a person has is indirectly related to the tension in his body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive life force, and every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that's stopping us is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it spread through the Mahayana way of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in its essence, and it includes the Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (enlightened energy) is awakened through yogic postures, aerobic exercises, mantri and visualizations.
The basis of Tibetan meditation is Divine Yoga, where visualizing various deities cleanses the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S.A. At the end of the war, these allied countries were divided by the very clash of systems, processes and culture.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last another 40 years, and it was really fought for through proxy armies on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defensive wall had been broken and the only hope for it was a retreat and rearrangement along the Romanian outskirts.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops, in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty, and other international treaties, bilateral and multilateral, entered the eastern regions of Poland and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional role of naval forces was to ensure that your country maintained the ability to move people and goods, while preventing your enemy from moving people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans tried to move troops and materiel across the Atlantic to help the British.
And at the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop these movements, mainly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have probably been able to conquer Britain, as well as the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and furs.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, and they were often herded by goat herders, who were often children or adolescents, like the common shepherds.
In England, railways were built as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriages were made of flat wooden planks, they allowed the draught horses to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Early on, rails were installed to hold the rails in place, but it was later found that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron belt on top.
This became common practice, but iron caused the wooden carriage wheels to wear out more.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were installed.
The first known form of transport is walking. People started walking upright about two million years ago, when Homo erectus evolved.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not normally walk upright.
Two-legged specialisations are found in the fossil Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to behave more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement and we can even become activists to some extent reduce suffering in the future.
As in many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment, but if we want a solution, we must get to the root of the problem and eliminate it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and overcrowding and extravagant lifestyles are making the problems worse.
After passing through Congress on July 4th, the handwritten bill signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's print shop.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made in a single night, and are now known as the "Dunlap sides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he had it read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap side pages are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today are of the opinion that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1. These numbers are referred to in computer jargon as binary digits or bits.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, as symptoms such as vomiting are too general to allow an immediate diagnosis.
The quickest sign of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household cleaning chemicals.
Look for the first aid instructions on the label for this particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "beetle" for this group of insects in a formal sense.
The name comes from the old knowledge of the bed bug, an insect highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the beetles and the insects are nidicoluminescent, adapted to live in the nest or placed on their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it one of the leading neurological diseases in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the interests of their child.
These couples may decide to make what is called an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can take over the child's care.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works by scientific methods, and these methods actually drive most of the scientific research.
But it's not just about experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
All of Aristotle's scientific knowledge, including that of psychology, was accepted.
The West gradually found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots as knowledge of Greek declined.
Many observed physiological and behavioral rhythms often critically depend on the presence of internal cycles and their formation by the biological clock.
In most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, there are documented regular rhythms that are not just responses to external repeating signals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators that will continue in a free-flowing cycle even in the absence of stimuli from the external environment.
The experiment conducted by Hershey and Chas was among the main indications that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments labeling either DNA in a phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in a phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on their type, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the cells are affected by germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
Examples include tours, photography, and getting to know the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns for work, and others pass by, working in the same places they left first.
In this shuttle transport, everyone is somehow tied to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has supplanted the stable state of the biosphere that has supported human development for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail every day, are they just incompetent transportation engineers, or is there something more fundamental?
The traffic flow is the result of observing the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and tracing their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is challenging because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently, and therefore, traffic flows, which can be roughly represented mathematically, often behave consistently.
For a more visual representation of the traffic flow, relationships between these three main characteristics were defined: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of terrestrial communications.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them escape their enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards along the body.
This gives them a greater choice of small towns to hide from predators.
Now, there's only one insect that can't fold its wings, and that's the dragonfly and the ladybug.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed otherwise; that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
It seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, and it carries more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, up to six miles wide in places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
The building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in size or technical perfection.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were captured by the relics of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest sovereign state with the lowest population.
In the Vatican, Italian is used for official communication and legislation.
Italian is also used on a daily basis by the majority of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they all occur naturally in nature and can be extracted relatively easily with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It seemed to have four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, yet he believed that they changed into new substances in order to produce what we see.
A compound is essentially a mixture of two or more metals, and don't forget, there are a lot of elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered to be metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There are alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into a period at the end of this sentence.
When the pencil was introduced, it became a good friend of many people.
However, as newer writing methods developed, the pencil was sidelined and used less and less.
People now leave links on their computer screens and never have to go near the grinder.
You can just think about what happens to the keyboard when something new comes along.
A thin bomb uses the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with a number of protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy truck up a hill, and then when you split the core again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they are prone to decay with little or no shock.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the upward side and 100 km on the downward side.
It's thinner under the ribs and thicker under the top.
The near side may have more moon morae because the crust is thinner, and the lava is easier to get to the surface.
Content theories are about finding what drives people to behave or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become their own in adulthood.
These theories focus on what motivates people to want to do certain things and what in their environment compels them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behaviour that can occur when managers start to lead their previous peers.At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain in the position of one of the party (or the buddies).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, determining responsibility, and being accountable to people.
On the other end of the spectrum, you're turning into an unrecognizable individual with a sense that you have to change everything that the team has done and do it your way.
The manager is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the whole team.
This behaviour often leads to conflict between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual and traditional teams follow the same quality standards, but with small differences.
Virtual team members usually serve as a point of contact for their physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, because their teams can meet according to changing time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
A unique part of a virtual team is also the presence of a true 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
Invisible team is the management team to which each member is subject.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used efficiently across the executive departments of the organization, the door to creativity and inventiveness opens.
The process of working together in an organisation to overcome an obstacle can then lead to a new innovative process that will help to meet the customer's needs.
The organisation can be innovative, but first management must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
The film Anjel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations aim to achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide tangible evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, narrowing the field of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes like never before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
AI has a strong science fiction connotation and constitutes a major branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of robots.
AI research involves the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Cases include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to life's problems.
Artificial intelligence is now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been incorporated into several applications in home computers, and video game software.
Excursions are an important part of the life of every class, and a teacher would often want to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual excursions, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artwork while sitting in a classroom with their classmates.
A great way to think about a trip and share experiences with other classes is to share a virtual trip.
For example, each year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a web page about their trip to the state capital, and each year the web page is redesigned, but older versions are kept online to serve as a notebook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing, and while students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually makes a difference.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author strives to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
The need to satisfy the audience's curiosity inspires students to become more skilled and to pursue their own interests (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs will allow students to deepen their analytical and critical thinking; through active response to online materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings as well as outline their own views on specific problems (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's enchanting 'bilingual' capital, and offers visitors a wealth of art galleries and museums that present its past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north are the pristine natural beauties of the Muskoka region.
All these and other things highlight Ontario as what foreigners consider to be fundamentally Canadian.
Large areas further north are relatively sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that may surprise many: There are more African Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or have ties with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the countries and the Comoros and Mayotte embraced it in a big way.
The period of European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route from Europe to India around the Cape of Good Hope.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All women travelers are advised to state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (but only if it does not look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they would normally consider harassment, such as being followed, grabbed by the shoulder, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to hold your ground (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C. and served as a strategic port for the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Merenids under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan renamed the city Dar al-Bajda, and Spanish merchants who established trading posts in the city named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan products such as taginis, pottery, leather goods, water pipes and a variety of geegaws are sold, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially its center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, before traveling outside Goma, you should do some research to understand the ongoing fighting situation in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the Nyiragongo volcano ascent and one of the cheapest places to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
To travel around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorized taxi).
Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor to refer to relatively inaccessible, exotic and distant countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a ruined city, though it has a reputation as a tourist attraction and has an airport.
In 1990, the city was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of desert sand.
It was one of Henry Louis Gates' main stops during the PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is in sharp contrast to other cities in the country, as its appearance is more Arab than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) in northeastern South Africa runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Krokodile River forms its southern boundary.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
The park's daily maintenance and admission fees are the same as those of all South African national parks.
The most advantageous option may be to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to either a select number of parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's national parks.
The whole area is called Hong Kong, after the island of Hong Kong, and it is the place that is the main focus of interest for many tourists.
The set of buildings that outline Hong Kong might be compared to the glowing column graph seen from Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best view of Hong Kong, you must leave the island and head for the coast of Kowloon.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the site that the British colonists took over, and if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarban is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands.
Sundarban has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest in Indian territory is designated as Sundarban National Park.
Not only are mangrove swamps included, but so are some of the last remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the Ganges Basin.
Sundarban covers an area of 3 850 km2, with about one-third of the area occupied by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a kingdom of wildlife, and it is estimated that there are now 400 tigers and some 30,000 axis deer in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-city bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance, as intercity buses are often crowded.
Most districts are served by small, comfortable, and robust Japanese Coaster buses.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby towns such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the entire length of the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers reach a height of 273 feet (83 m), are 1,800 feet [378 m] long, and have two lanes that are 12 feet [3 m] wide.
The vertical light height under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft).[citation needed] Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not put into operation until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is scheduled for September 2017, by which time the Brazilian customs inspections should be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group of the people, living in what is now eastern Paraguay, semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Obrovskaya Province of India", was born as a result of the Spanish conquerors' encounter with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo grounds in the district of Las Cañitas.
Minor tournaments and matches are held here at other times of the year.
Information about the tournaments and the possibility of buying tickets for the polo matches can be found on the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands pound (FKP), which is set at the equivalent of one British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards, and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards in remote islands are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to find out what payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkish currency outside the islands, so take your money with you before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, when it's in the northern hemisphere, winter is summer, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no special 'wet' and 'dry' seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to human presence, the wildlife remains wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wild animals!
No matter how calm they appear, buffalo, deer, deer, bears, and almost any large animal can strike.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep enough distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so we need to give them space.
Also, be aware that the scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking spicy foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of almost 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of the infamous naval misunderstanding of 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the US and the UK refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau, a peaceful gathering of people in the city led to the assassination of Tupua supreme leader Tamasese Lealofi III.
The border of the two harbours in Auckland allows for the existence of many beaches, the most popular being located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in North Harbor County) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most of them offer the shade of pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded beaches for families with many shops lining the shore.
The main local beer is Number One, not a complex beer, but a nice and refreshing one.
Many French wines are available, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more available.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried about getting it, it's not a problem to get bottled water.
The concept of "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians, with small black coffee being an "espresso", cappuccino served with a high layer of cream (not penny), and tea served without milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the instructions of the competent authorities, pay attention to the instructions on the labels and pay particular attention to the safety warnings.
Jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of the town of 1770 and occasionally outside of this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and usually swim away.
Sea crocodiles do not live primarily in the ocean, their normal habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking ahead of time gives the traveler the assurance that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies usually have an agreement with specific hotels, but they also offer the possibility of booking other forms of accommodation, such as camping.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need more time to think through the offer or to obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any suggestions for changes or requests should be directed first to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
As for some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors choose to camp on site, and most participants consider this to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get there early to get camping close to the music.
Remember that even when the music ends on the main stages, some parts of the festival may play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are travelling through the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of your hut, as walking on ice causes quite a terrible noise to those who are most affected.
Cruises in St. Petersburg also include a stay in the city.Passengers on a cruise are exempted from the visa requirement (but check the conditions).
Casinos usually do their best to keep guests occupied and spend as much money as possible, and most lack windows or clocks and have difficulty finding exits.
They usually have unique offerings of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests entertained and to keep them going for as long as possible.
Since drunkenness impairs judgment, all good players are aware of the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will be riding in high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or frost.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you cannot drive as if you were on clear asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you could get stuck in it.
Reduced visibility may be caused by falling or blowing snow, condensation of water on windows or ice forming on the vehicle windows.
In contrast, in many lands ice and snow are common, and traffic runs almost continuously throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and a great experience for many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to designate a ground trip to explore the great African wilderness, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment will allow for good observation.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are better seen from a distance with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called bushwalk or tourist safari or just walking) is a tourist trip of several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in different locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, with the games taking place in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay notice, you may have gotten into an awkward situation.
The cancellation conditions vary, but by the end of March, most cancellations that originate from the coronavirus will not exceed the July 2020 deadline, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets can be expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with the price of a standard ticket around 7,000 yen.
Ironing helps dry wet clothes, and even when they are not in the room, many hotels have an ironing board and iron for borrowing.
If an iron is not available or if you do not like ironing socks, you can try using a hair dryer if available.
Be careful not to make the cloth too hot (this can cause it to shrink, and in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water takes only a minute; in others, it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a company with a good reputation.
Travellers may come into contact with animal pests which are not present in their home regions.
Harmful organisms can degrade food, cause irritation, or in the worst case cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or violently kill humans are not normally classified as pests.
Purchasing in so-called duty free zones allows goods to be purchased free of ordinary and excise duties.
Travelers heading to high-tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, as it often passes through isolated forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: they are full of steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp bends.
The published speed limits are significantly lower than on the previous and subsequent sections - generally 56-64 km/h  and strict adherence to them is more important than ever.
Surprisingly, the cell phone service here is much stronger than on many other sections of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German confectionery is quite good, and Bavaria's is quite colorful and varied, similar to that of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cake is common, with apples baking year-round, while cherries and plums appear in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you want a small but hearty pastry, try the stuffed doughnut, which is called either Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
We know curry as "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid used.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines that you can find across the country.
When used without further qualification, the term tends to denote food originally from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, contains a variety of simply seasoned dishes. The predominant seasonings enjoyed by Javanese include peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The struts are supports for the rider's legs, which hang on either side of the seat.
They provide greater stability to the rider, but can also pose a safety risk as they can potentially trap the rider's feet.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has his foot caught in the saddle, he could be dragged if the horse escapes.

Popular winter downhill sports such as skiing and snowboarding involve sliding down snowy terrain with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many enthusiasts, occasionally known as ski fanatics, who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a given location.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
Cross-country skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norse opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backpacking, ski mountaineering, or ski tourism.
Related (but usually not included) to alpine skiing and mountaineering, which is practiced on steep terrain and requires much harder skis and shoes.
Consider a ski trail as a similar tourist trail.
Under the right conditions, you will be able to cover a little more distance than if you were walking  but you will rarely reach the speed you would if you were running without a heavy backpack on a modified track.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is home to many independent states.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to repeatedly apply for visas and pass passport checks.
In this respect, the Schengen area functions to some extent as one country.
If you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through the passport control checkpoints again.
Also, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa to each of the Schengen countries separately, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of antique goods, but some tax authorities define antique goods as being over 100 years old.
Conditions of confinement vary around the world, and this age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be classified as antiques despite being younger than a similar mass-produced product.
Reindeer herding is an important way of life for the Sami, and the culture of trade is important for many other professions.
Traditionally, however, not all Sami were involved in reindeer husbandry in large numbers, but they also subsisted on fishing, hunting, and the like, using reindeer mainly as beasts of burden.
Today, many Sámi are involved in modern crafts.

Adverse weather is a general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, cause serious social disruption or lead to loss of human life.
Adverse weather and its varieties, which depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions, can occur anywhere in the world.
High winds, hailstorms, excessive rainfall, and fires are the forms and effects of inclement weather, such as storms, tornadoes, water storms, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal adverse weather events include thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to consider any risks that may arise from adverse weather in their area, which could affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country considered to be a war zone should take part in a vocational training course.
Just search the Internet for "hostile environments" and you will likely find the address of a local business.
The course covers all the issues discussed in greater detail, along with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, first-aid instruction and sometimes perhaps weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wilderness are common, but publications dealing with war zones are scarce.
Travellers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents with them for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with no gender (X) or documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents is similarly diverse.
In the aftermath of 9/11, security checkpoints became much more intrusive.
Transgender people before surgery shouldn't expect to pass the scans without interference with their privacy and dignity.
Back currents are the returning fallout from waves that break on a beach, often at a reef or similar.
Thanks to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in several deeper sections, where a fast current can form up to deep water.
In most deaths, exhaustion can cause the temptation to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to head somewhere where you won't be caught again, or depending on your skills and whether you've been recorded, you might try to wait for rescue.
The return shock occurs more quickly than the culture shock (the initial phase of the idyll is shorter), lasts longer, and may be more severe.
For travellers who have easily adapted to a new culture, it is sometimes particularly difficult to readjust to their original culture.
After returning home from abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of your customs from the home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
People may not anticipate that travelers returning home need patience and understanding.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in this area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show begins.

The pyramids are depicted in different scenes and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetlands, discovered in 1819, is claimed by several countries and has the most bases, of which sixteen are still active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest of which is King Juraj Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston and Deception, where a flooded caldera of a still-active volcano forms a beautiful natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is an area located in the southern part of the peninsula and is bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula mountains here join the plateau and then reemerge to form the 360-kilometer-long chain of Ellsworth Mountains, which is carved by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range contains the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak Mount Vinson, reaching 4,892 m (15,980 ft) above sea level.
Satellite phone may be your only option in remote areas where there is no cell phone coverage.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, and to make a call with it, you must be outside in a place with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
This service is often used in shipping, including cruise ships, as well as on voyages requiring remote data and voice communications.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information on connecting to this service.
For those planning a gap-year holiday, travel and learning is the increasingly popular choice.
It is especially popular among recent graduates, as it offers them the option of a free year before university, without compromising their education.

Registration for these educational programmes usually requires payment of a tuition fee.
Finland is a great place for boating.The 'land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, in lakes and on coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht on the islands and lakes.
While the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national sport of Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
The same is true for Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it's quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, it's 1 in 40).
Most Baltic Sea voyages also offer extended stays in St Petersburg, Russia.
It means you have a couple of full days to visit the historic city, while you're back on the ship for the night.
If you only go to the coast for a cruise ship excursion, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not located by the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by air can be a frightening experience, regardless of the age or occupation of the passengers, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and aversions that so many people have.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during flight may help overcome the fear that is based on the unknown or on not having things under control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast delivery, and time is often critical when it comes to commercial documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and smaller companies, the problem has arisen.
If goods were sent by air freight, unloading and unloading could take days on some routes.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage, but airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, so here you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to allocate a large amount of money to this privilege (or ideally to force your company to do so for you).
But it will not be cheap: you can expect to pay an estimated four times the normal fare for business class and up to eleven times for first class!
In general, it is not worthwhile to seek discounts on business or first class tickets for direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines know full well that there is a certain basic group of passengers who are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau, and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is very common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-styled Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transportation hub.

Treat the site with the utmost dignity, with all the seriousness and respect it deserves.
Do not damage the site by writing or scratching graffiti on buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish.About half of the population prefers to communicate in Catalan, the vast majority understands it and Spanish is spoken by practically everyone.
However, most of the signs and markings are in Catalan only, since it is established by law as the first official language.

The rigid Parisian air will quickly evaporate if you show a little courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely covered with forests, mainly beech, spruce and eider trees, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide range of plant communities due to its range of microclimates, different soils and different altitudes.

Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and tetra are found here, along with many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide robes for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one of bright colors, the monk or nun may smile at you as you enter.
The same regulations require men to wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow tattoos from the pantry at the entrance, but be aware that clothes are not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts.
The cuisine of Mallorca, like that of other Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (primarily pork) and does not go without olive oil.
A simple favorite dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes or other accompaniment, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns and pronouns begin with a capital letter, even if they are in the middle of a sentence.

Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christendom, and it is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many of the holiday traditions have been adopted by nonbelievers and non-Christians throughout the world.
Traditionally, you will stay up all night under the clear sky to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Mass on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with services often celebrating the midnight mass to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally came to the islands either came swimming, flying, or swimming.
The great distance from the mainland prevented mammals from making this journey, and the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans on the Galapagos, many mammals have been brought to the area, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you may experience a polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It'll be a good opportunity to observe the aurora because the sky will be dark more or less continuously.
And you'll be able to enjoy the stars, too, because light smog is not a problem in sparsely populated areas.
Japanese work culture is much more hierarchical and formal than what people in the West are used to.
Suits are common work clothes, and co-workers address each other by surnames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is key, emphasizing the efforts of the group rather than the achievements of individuals.
Often, employees must obtain the approval of their superiors before making any decision, and they are expected to follow their instructions implicitly.
