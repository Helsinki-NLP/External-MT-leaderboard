Ganduje responded to the allegations of selling the Daula hotel - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
Kano State Governor Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje said his government is making abandoned state government assets owned to provide infrastructure which is a step towards making Kano one of the world's largest cities.
This was stated in a statement signed by Aminu Yassar, the director of media of the Kano government.
The statement said that instead of allowing the government's resources, which cost a lot of money to produce, to be destroyed, it would be better to have public utility facilities.
The announcement also said that this would help to generate revenue for the government in addition to providing employment to the state's many young people.
Recently, the candidate for governor of Kano state under the banner of the PDP party in the last election, Abba Kabir Yusuf, filed a complaint in court accusing the state government of taking over some state assets from businessmen.
Gottlieb warns that "it will be very difficult to open" schools and autumn in areas where the spread of the coronavirus has failed to be contained
Washington - Dr. Scott Gottlied, former chairman of the Food and Drug Administration, warned that "it would be very difficult" for schools in the districts to open for the third time in the next academic year if the spread of the coronavirus in the districts is not curbed.
For schools in neighborhoods in districts, I think they need to look at the causes of the spread of the disease in places.
If the problem of the spread of the disease in neighbourhoods is not contained, it is extremely difficult to open up in such a situation".
With the fall semester camp approaching in a few weeks, the Trump administration has called on schools in the districts to open their classes so students can start taking classes in a visual format - five times a week.
But this pressure from President Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos came when Mr Trump warned last week that the coronavirus could "spread before it eases" and agreed that schools in tropical districts should delay opening by a few weeks.
However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a statement on Thursday on how to open schools so that students can return without the possibility of infection.
The directive calls on schools to abide by the principle of time-sharing, calls on students and teachers to impose restrictions and put students in circuits to reduce contact, a few of the other guidelines.
The CDC, however, does not provide a measure of how well school districts can drop out or close schools entirely if a case of coronavirus is reported, which Gottlied calls "disappointing".
"In a climate of uncertainty and lack of clarity on how to keep schools open, I feel that many parents will make mistakes in taking precautions", he says.
"That is why it is so important to have specific information on the complexity of the measurement that the CDC's sensory intelligence system has not yet reached".
Gottlied said that district schools should reflect on the impact of the outbreak on their communities and how to conduct the testing so that decisions can be made on how to address the issue and whether to continue to leave the school open or to return to online learning altogether.
The probability of infection ranging from 5% to 10% is that "feelings will rise" while more than 10% is "a level at which you have to be very careful about whether or not to close schools in a black zone".
"This is a sign that the pandemic has really taken this place by storm", Gottlieb says, "it would be a challenge for some areas of Florida that have been the center of the coronavirus epidemic in the United States, to open their schools and return to school as usual".
More than 30 states and the District of Columbia are experiencing an increase in coronavirus cases, while the Sun Belt is the center of its spread.
But Gottlieb said there was evidence that some states, including Arizona and Texas, would see peaks.
Although Gottlieb says there are "unpredictable signs" of the epidemic being rampant in some states across the Sun Belt, it is "scattering" in others, including South Carolina, Alabama, Indiana and Illinois.
Many governments have enacted legislation requiring people to place restrictions when they are in public and to stop reopening public places, in an attempt to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
Gottlieb said states should consider the possibility of closing bars, limiting the crowds in restaurants, closing cinemas and even other indoor entertainment venues, and implementing a mask policy to curb the spread of the pandemic, measures that would allow states to halt the retreat to the most stringent restrictions imposed at the start of the outbreak in March.
In addition to states that issue masks, most companies require customers to also wear masks.
McDonald's is among those requiring face masks, as well as the leading food retailer Walmart, Starbucks and others in enforcing their own restrictions.
Gottlieb said he hopes to see more businesses implement masks in their areas, especially those deemed to be highly dangerous.
"If we can really cope with the continued spread of the disease until the winter season until we reach a vaccine or a form of treatment that changes the course of this disease, medically, only with a mask that would be something simple that we can do that will not really change our lives, and allows us to keep what is important to us like opening up some businesses open, like bringing our children back to school", he said.
While Mr. Trump said he would not impose a nationwide mask ban, he urged Americans last week to wear a mask of compassion, saying during a White House press briefing that they "are effective".

The Reason for the Firing of Our Talented Officer - Chairman of NSCDC.
The head of the National Civil Defence Force, Muhammad Gana Abdullahi, explained why his agency fired his own officer, who was shown on video taking the footage of the EndSARS demonstration in Gwagalada, the Federal Capital of Nigeria, Abuja, a few days ago.
Ghana explained the reason for the agency's transfer of LEADERSHIP TODAY to the National Agency's headquarters in Abuja, adding that the agency's workplace management had made it necessary for its authorities to decide to remove the officer from office entirely.
Describing the situation, Ghana said, "If you had been sent to provide security... they called me and told me that they were 16 but there were more than 500 people there, and I heard about it, and even some security guards had fled, so I told you to back off and not take a hard step.
If you were assigned to guard the area, why would you go and take the forbidden goods, even to be taken?
What a thrill!
So I immediately called our management, we sat down and decided to fire him.
This would teach the other minds that in Civil Defence we cannot tolerate immorality.
While LEADERSHIP Today reported that there were some security officials who were videotaped for their surveillance, there was no report of their leaders firing them.
"We at Civil Defence have taken the necessary measures, and they and other authorities have been affected".
He then urged Nigerian youths to stay away from such a mess, as wasting national resources in such a way is a waste, which could pose problems for the future of the youth.
So he urged them to avoid being influenced by other insects.

Bachaka residents began to migrate to the Niger Republic.
Five people were killed and more than 30 houses destroyed in the town of Bachaka in the North Governorate of Kebbi State in heavy rainstorms, forcing the local community to migrate to the newly independent Republic of Niger.

He said that now, whenever a storm hits everyone is up until the rain is lifted, because every morning God rains, and houses are consumed by the threat of the gas.
The Chief Minister of Bachaka, Alhaji Yakubu Maiyaki, called on the Kebbi State Government to bring us in, so now due to heavy rains many people have lost their jobs and their inheritance for decades.
After this and now the nine primary schools of the town and the makewayi (flood) were destroyed, and the next day they were left without any sign, and then this primary school was the only one in and around Bachaka, which if no emergency action was taken, the town could rise up completely.
Honarabul Garba Yeldu (Marasco), Chairman of the Northern Municipal Council, expressed his concern over the loss of these people, promising that the municipality will not give up until it sees the state government and emergency services take action to save the people of the town.
He said that the project was actually more powerful than the local government.
He added that he had just reported the explosion to the Kebbi State Emergency Management Agency (KSEMA), where they requested the names of the affected men.
Some sources told the Leader's Today representative that many of those who lost their homes have now moved to Niger, as the country is almost the same, except that the streets alone divide the cities, but there are good social connections and marriages.

The American Anti-Racism League held a protest
Protesters swept the streets of many U.S. cities to draw attention to racial injustice.
More than two months of protests have been taking place in Portland, Oregon since May 25 following the death of George Floyd while he was held in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Trump administration sent federal security officials to Portland, which fueled the protests.
The protest then escalated into protests against the arrival of these city officials.
In Seattle, police used tear gas and smoke to arrest 45 people on Saturday after protests in support of the Porland protests turned violent.
Police said more than 20 police officers were wounded.
On Saturday night in Austin, Texas a man lost his life when another man shot at Black Lives Matter protesters.

Police said three NFAC members were injured on Saturday when a gunman shot one of them by mistake.
Reports that the US is pressuring Nord Stream 2-RT contractors trade news
The US government has repeatedly attempted to force European companies to abandon the Russian-led Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, Welt am Sonntag reported, providing examples and people with expertise in the subject.
According to the newspaper, officials from the US State Department, the Treasury Department, and the Department of Energy approached the European Union contractors to understand what the risks would be if they continued the project.
Nearly a dozen U.S. officials are reported to have had at least two online conversations with company representatives in recent days.
Speaking in a "face-to-face" interview, the US insisted it wanted to block the completion of my project Nord Stream2, according to some observers of the talks.
"I believe the threat is real", one of them told the German-language news outlet.
These threats coincide with a statement by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last week, warning that companies involved in the operation should "immediately exit" or face penalties under Section 232 of the American Anti-Tank Policy Act (CAATSA).
In addition to Russia's energy giant Gazprom, which is leading the project, other companies and European countries have also been involved.
Their companies are Engie of France OMV of Austria, Royal Dutch Shell of the UK-Dutch, then Wintershall and Uniper of Germany.
In an interview with Welt am Sonntag, the newspaper said Amurkla's attempts to subvert "the vital infrastructure" were a breach of European sovereignty.
Earlier this week, the US House of Representatives approved an amendment to the National Security License Act that was extended to impose sanctions on companies involved in the construction of Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
According to one of the proponents of the resolution, the measures to be taken will concern companies that provide, or assist ships, or insurance or all cargo on the coast, or the operation and maintenance of these ships, and those that issue the certification of the Nord Stream 2's operational quality.
Both European business and government officials have strongly condemned the US's failed efforts to supply Europe's energy by imposing sanctions on the Nord Stream2 project, which some have even called on Brussels to consider retaliatory measures.
Moscow also lashed out at Washington, calling the move "steel-steel".
Earlier this week, Dmitry Presko, a presidential spokesman, said that Russia would issue a new plan for completing the project if Washington continued this aggressive move.

Magu denied allegations of stealing 329 billion naira from NNPC.
Deputy Chairman of EFCC Ibrahim Magu, denied a new allegation that he misappropriated some of the money he had stolen from NNPC.
His lawyer Wahab Shittu said Magu after taking the money from the major oil dealers, converted it into the NNPC account.
Wahab Shittu said after Magu returned the funds, he even gave the receipt of the evidence of receipt of the NNPC funds to NNPC.
The truth rumours that Magu has suppressed the NNBG's 329 billion naira that he has seized from the major oil dealers are just a rumour.
Magu took the money and converted it into NNPC accounts by "remittance", even giving him receipts to prove receipt of the funds".
The NNPC had sought EFCC to confiscate her money from the major oil dealers.
She withdrew and the money was transferred to the NNPC account.
I even kept the receipt as a witness.
So she would be asked to suppress the funds or accounts of others that did not get in, and then to set up the NNPC account?
Then he said that Magu would never again face the scourge of evil.
Any accusation against him would be a serious one.
He who strikes him on the head will be struck with a piece of wood.
Just last week, Magu challenged the teacher to bring one witness to the scene where he received the black box.
Last week the teacher announced that Magu was suspended on the orders of President Muhammadu Buhari.
While Magu denied the accusations, he also defended his account, exposing the allegations of corruption that his Master had often inflicted.

The hunger strike group dismantled Yoho after the incident at the Capitol
WASHINGTON (AP) - A Christian nonpartisan group working to end hunger said on Saturday it had applied for and received a resignation letter from its board of directors from Congressman Ted Yoho following what it called a "crime of violence" against Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio - Cortez, from the state of New York, accused Florida congressman Yohi of using a tongue-in-cheek and a tongue-in-cheek slur to him during a rescue last Monday on the steps to the Capitol building.
Yoho refused to use her words, although a journalist who was treated before him confirmed that he used the harsh words as she explained.

The CIIE Exhibition Became a Testimony to China's Strength in Implementing the Sustainable Development Goals.
For any media fan, he will not miss the opening of the third China Imported Equipment Exhibition or CIIE in Shanghai.
If we observe the speech of Chinese President Xi Jinping, during the opening ceremony of the exhibition, we can observe how he described the new steps his country will implement in the field of opening doors to foreigners from all walks of life, in a step of "Run together and survive together".
Apart from the open door issue, there are other important development initiatives that Chinese authorities have announced to implement, including the continuous development and improvement of the foreign investment environment in the country, the international trade of services, the economic development using modern internet technologies, the deepening of reforms, innovation in trade and investment, free market opening, etc.
If we take a closer look, this did not go to the CIIE summit, it would provide an opportunity to assure the entire world that China's economic development policies will not change.
and the many challenges facing the country, as well as the rest of the world, related to the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, will not slide over China, halting its growth.
In particular, we saw how this year's festival, attracted more participants from companies, industry, "business and government representatives, including those from the African continent, who celebrated China's ambition to embrace international relations, in a joint effort to achieve success.
In general, we can say that China's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, its efforts to ensure domestic economic growth, its efforts to further open its doors to foreigners, and the conduct of this CIIE exhibition at a time when the world faces major challenges, are signs that it is strong enough to continue and implement its sustainable development policies as planned.

Wilfred Zaha wanted to leave Crystal Palace according to Roy Hudgson: "Keep your eye on the spot"
Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson addressed the forward in the pre-season finale as he announced that the club's attacking white-blooded Wilf Zaha was planning to leave the club.
The Côte d'Ivoire native and international star who has been with Selhurst Park for over five years, has now begun to pack his bags for the future, after his fame was being traded to Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
At the age of 27, everyone wrapped their hands to see if such a big club would be interested in making money, especially in this spring filled with fears of a recession in sports, after the breakthrough in which Zaha scored four goals and managed to help the club win five times to secure a place in the Palace team which was impossible.
Speaking after the final, Hodgson told Alex Crock of TalkSport that he "was watching this gap" regarding Zaha's chances of leaving the club after he replied that the forward "was clearly" that he saw his progress there somewhere far from the club.
The forward has three years left on his contract with Palace and last year they said they needed £100 million if they wanted to fight him out of the club.
Hodgson's side finished the race with seven consecutive losses and a horse's ear on the final day, which led to a return to the 14th stage of the race.
Zaha himself scored just once in mid-December and at the end of the season, a long-term goalless draw for Chelsea.
He reportedly submitted a transfer request last summer in an attempt to avoid the run, but it was not possible to attract the attention of the Palace to sell him.
In a physical attempt to improve his chances of leaving the club, Zaha changed his name in January and the important events ahead of him for the following weeks made it clear that he was leaving the club.
Zaha was scheduled to play most of the minutes of the Premier League game this season against Palace, as well as being the only player under 28 to play for 1,100 minutes or more, see how much extra money was required to be paid to the number 11 player.
Malaysia is searching for 24 Rohingya believed to have drowned off the coast of the island
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (AP) - Malaysian authorities said on Sunday that they were looking for some 12 Rohingya refugees who were believed to have drowned after jumping from their boat off the resort island of northern Langkawi.
Zawawi Abdullah, a senior official at Malaysia's water law enforcement agency, said early police records showed that only one of the 25 Rohingya who jumped from the boat managed to swim to the coast.
The only survivor sought help from the police on Saturday afternoon and was detained for further investigation, Zawawi said.
Thousands of Rohingya Muslims fled Myanmar after a military invasion, and many live in densely populated refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Malaysia and Muslim-majority countries are a destination for ships designed by human traffickers to provide better living conditions for Roma refugees abroad.
Zawawi said that two ships and an airplane were sent to investigate the sinking.
He said the agency would also inform local fishermen and neighbouring Thai authorities to help with the investigation.
He gave no further details about the refugee ship.
Last month, Malaysian authorities detained 269 Rohingya refugees and found a body on a boat allegedly belonging to a gangster far from Langkawi who they said was deliberately destroyed to be further diverted to sea.
The Malaysian Maritime Authority later reported that 269 people were disembarked from a large ship that is believed to have lost dozens of lives and their bodies were thrown into the sea.
Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said Malaysia could not accommodate more Rohingya refugees as it struggles with economic recession due to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
But he said that those in the land would not be returned to the Sea.
Malaysia is home to over 2 million migrants and 180,000 other refugees and asylum seekers - including 101,000 Rohingya - who have registered with the UN refugee agency.

"This part of the theory is related to the necessity of changing education in schools and outside school programs, in terms of learning, attitudes, and judgments made by young Polish natives, in our opinion, the assumption that sex education is traditional, and in fact everything is subject to social, cultural and gender conditions".
In Ziobro's view, the decision to impose a curriculum on children and adolescents and to establish family relationships between homosexuals and lesbians in a social environment is unacceptable.
"We will also not allow homosexual and transgender people to be involved in the spread of this culture by human rights activists and 'gay activists' who want to make their ideas legal", he said.

How Nigeria can revive its education system.
Former President Olusegun Obasanjo said that there are now more than 14 million children in the country who are not attending school.
He said that this was a hindrance to their knowledge.
He also said that education in this country would never improve unless it was the young people who were the main contributors to education.

Her organization focuses on promoting the advancement of knowledge that some leaders in the community have focused on implementing and managing.
"These millions of children are being denied access to knowledge that can use their talents and skills, so that the community benefits them, and they also benefit the community", Obasanjo said.
Evidence suggests that as long as education reform is needed in the country, it is only young people who take the lead in education.
Not only in the education sector, Obasanjo said that young people must take leadership in various sectors and sectors in the society, and then they can emerge from the clutches of the challenges facing the education and other sectors in the country.
On your side of the organization, their students have successfully entered different classes and have won.
"I recently learned that the students of 'Teach For Nigeria Fellows', have finished second in the National Lafarge Competition and have the opportunity to earn further education at higher education institutions".

Coman spent nearly 10 years at PSG, starting from the club's junior academy to playing four games for the club at senior level.

Coles abandoned children's toys and embraced books in a new shopping spree.
"We listened to the real thing, and that was one of the key factors in our planning", says Ms. Ronson.
"We don't think people will ever bring their old books out again for recycling - we think they'll want to keep their belongings, but they'll use them for their own good if they want to".
Ms Ronson said that this new awareness campaign was long thought about before the outbreak of COVID-19, and despite the pandemic, she agreed that now is the "right time" to start this new campaign to see the opportunity for parents to spend more time with their parents.
The analysts expressed concern over how shoppers are showing a lack of concern about buying fruit from the grocery store, but Ms Ronson said they were not feeling tired.
"We have not seen anything of this yet, but we have been watching", she says.
"We analyzed a lot of data, weekly, monthly, to make sure we were launching the products that our customers would like" .
The popularity of the retail campaign was initiated by Coles in Australia under the name Little shop which was launched in mid-2015 and continued to be repeated, resulting in a dramatic commercial storm at the same time in mid-2015.
Already Woolworths followed up with his own campaign called 'Lion king Ooshiess which helped revive the big shops and their trade, and recently a series of garden cut products in which the system would give anyone who bought a gift of flowers and medicinal plants to plant.
However, despite UBS analysts' forecasts that Australia's retail sector will experience a rise in the prices of goods due to the COVID-19 pandemic until the end of fiscal 2021.
Ms Ronson urged shoppers to expect more retailers to sell their best products in the next wave which would lead to a 'little shop' system being reversed.
"There are such intentions to buy the best products that will be launched in the world, but we are increasingly encouraged by such products from abroad.
"We should keep doing these things to make sure we are worth your while and the wealth of business we have

He said China was ready, signed free trade agreements with other countries.

Serbia requests more fighter jets amid the Balkan violence
BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) - Serbia will strengthen its military and as it seeks to buy more warplanes, violent protests are escalating, the Serbian leader said on Sunday.
President Aleksandar Vucic said "some steps" in pursuing a series of fighter-bomber acquisitions, accusing the United States and other non-Serbian Western countries of being NATO's neighbour and having disappeared from the former province of Kosovo.
"Americans, Turks and Germans are trying to take care of their children", Vucic said, referring to Kosovo.
He said that the United States recently delivered large armored vehicles to Kosovo's military.
During a visit to the armoured forces, Vucic said his country could not compete with its neighbors for "NATO's arms-free status", so we had to do it alone".
Vucic did not specify what type of fighter jets Serbia plans to buy, but pro-government media reported that his administration had officially requested the United States to provide them with 20 fighter-bombers.
Reports suggest that Washington has not said anything about Belgrade's demand and that it has denied, then, that there is a possibility of buying 25 Russian Sukhoi attack aircraft.
Serbia, which claims to be a military ally of our country, recently received some advanced equipment and warplanes from Russia, which also lost warplanes, attack helicopters and armored vehicles.
On one Serbian invasion, China delivered her military-powered self-propelled aircraft.
U.S. officials have previously spoken out openly against imposing sanctions on Serbia if Moscow sends more weapons to her, especially those that could threaten the security of NATO's neighboring countries.
Western countries and some neighboring Serbia are looking at the development of nuclear weapons by China and Russia.
The Balkans, which were recovering from a devastating civil war in the 1990's, were becoming increasingly unpopular.
NATO Security Council intervened in Serbia to stop the Serbian bloodshed against Albanian couples in Kosovo in the 1999s.
Despite her request to join the European Union, the white Serbian president further strengthened the country's political and military ties with the Kremlin and Beijing.
Serbia, Russia and China have not ratified Kosovo's independence, which has been recognized by the United States and most European countries.
Historical attention can play a vital role in reconciling
Divorce is profound when understanding and healing should be our goal.
Our schooling system is part of a process that we blame for this lack of knowledge and understanding.
The history of Australia is not well-educated.
In fact, without the strictest of practices, the only school that focuses on our history - "Australian history", in the 12th year - will die out in the next five years, perhaps even before that time.
Last year, out of the 49,324 Victoria students who graduated from VCE, only 628 or 1 percent made the Australian record.
In the past six years, that number has nearly halved, with nearly a hundred students enrolling each year.
The main reason why few students chose to study Australian history in the 12th grade was that nothing had been done in previous years to stimulate interest in doing so.
History is not just a private field of study, but it is integrated into the complexities of "human affairs".
So in seven and eight years, the students completed a brief summary of the ancient cultures of the Aboriginal people and Torres Islanders".
In the next nine and ten years, there was another section focusing on Australia during the war.
For many Victorian students, this is the total Australian history taught throughout their years of High School.
In the ninth and tenth centuries, there was a selection of a section that was compiled from 1750 to 1918.
Three other things needed to be done to save history in Australia in Victorian schools.
Historical restoration was first made into the private sector of education such as English, Literature, and Science.
Because history is taught only in human subjects, it is given a brief place in the system of scholarship.
Similarly, it is often taught by ordinary anthropologists who do not study history themselves.
The study of history, like the study of witnesses, is complex.
We must recruit qualified historians to ensure that they are taught in a simple and interesting way.
Third, an examination of Australian history from 1788 to 1914 must be compulsory.
The students enjoyed the contrast.
Many of my former students decided that they would not be doing Australian history at age 12 because they would have learned the basics from the beginning.
Knowing our history alone cannot eliminate the deepest differences of race.
But without it, as Victoria's academic curriculum made clear, the work would be impossible.

The Mahara released the wife of the gang leader and took her to Jigawa.
The neighbors who kidnapped the wife of the rebel commander Abdullahi Suleiman were released on Monday night.
The source told PREMIUMTIMES that Suleiman's 50-year-old wife Husna was released after paying a $2.0 million ransom.
A spokesman for the Audu state police, Jinjiri, did not confirm whether the ransom was paid but said the assailants released Husna at 10 pm on Monday.
Later on Tuesday, a relative of Suleiman's family told PREMIUM TIMES that the gunmen demanded a ransom of up to 50 million naira, but were later found to have agreed to pay 2 million naira.
He said that the raiders had taken Hushnah and the other men whom you had taken captive in the wilderness of Ringim.
Husna is home with her family in good health.
SANDARY TEST: Nigeria will use the GCE results as an alternative to WASSCE in 2020.
The Federal Government has stated that it may have asked students to take the GCE exam in November, citing a failure to complete the preparations for the WASSCE, West African exam within the deadline.
The GCE is a separate test, written in November and published in December.
This was announced by the Prime Minister of Education, Emeka Nwajuiba at a two-week press conference on the situation regarding the Coronavirus pandemic in the country.
The minister said that this change was necessary to see that there was no reason to extend the deadline for writing the WASSCE exams.
PREMIUM TIMES reported how the federal government announced the suspension of school attendance, after having already set a date for school attendance.
She then said that no secondary school in Nigeria will open until students take the WASSCE exam between 5 August and 5 September.
This was achieved to avoid the possibility of coronavirus infection for students due to the congestion in the exam rooms.
Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, and Gambia are also trying to overcome the possibility of postponing the start date of the examinations.
The minister said the ongoing spread of the Coronavirus pandemic has made states not yet ready for students to return to schools.

THE BLOOD: The Hisbah group smashed 588 bottles of wine in Ringim.
The Anti-Crime Prevention Board (Hisbah), has announced the arrest and breaking of 588 bottles of wine in the Ringim municipality of Jigawa state.
The director of the agency Ibrahim Ɗahiru reported this to the Nigerian Press Agency on Sunday in Dutse.
Dahiru said the agency broke the bottles on August 29.
He said they had collected bottles of wine from the villages of Mount Babaye, Gujungu, Kijawal and Wadugur in the Ringim sub-district.
Mohar explained that Islam forbids drinking alcohol and other intoxicants in the city and the countryside.
He said the agency would continue to arrest and ban such crimes in the nation.
If you remember in September 2019, the Hisbah Commission seized and smashed 196,400 bottles of wine all over Kano.
The bottles of alcohol were broken in the Kalemawa Forest, in the Tofa Municipal Drug Administration, where Governor Abdullahi Ganduje stated that Islam forbids drinking alcohol and all other intoxicants, which could harm the human brain.
Our Islamic clergy, our leaders, should join forces to fight this issue of eliminating toxic drugs.

Jose Morinho looked at the house claiming that everything would be easy for Tottenham, good news for the spectators when they look back.
Jose Morinho helped Tottenham Hotspur start a new and unsuccessful tour since the start of the Premier League, but he argues that returning home and focusing on building a home would not have been possible without the help of fans.
The Spurs have won 12 of their home games this season, but have lost four times - only one of their six home games.
The Portuguese coach says that some successes can be achieved without the help of fans, but it is better to do so in front of them.
"There are things we need to do with them". Without them you can create a dark barrier, but only in the system of the game", he said.
"But I think if you have fans, you can make him as strong as he is because the way he gets more and more touching during the game that is only on the pitch with the fans being available"
Mourinho feels that achieving such a long-term and home-like career is something he enjoys at Chelsea. Liverpool have built up a long three-season streak, and that becomes difficult as the competition gets harder, and his rivalry gets stronger.
This is another important factor in determining whether a team can achieve its goal at the end of the season, especially in games that are rarely played or where home-country racing is highly effective.
"I feel like the Frimean League is a goal and these achievements are some of the things that are still to be achieved because of the youth of the clubs"
"But being a hero at home and finishing the season with high points in your pocket from the games you played is very important"
"I feel our results in the home games we've played without fans are very important, but we need them to come back to us".
Look at the success we've had beating Arsenal if the stadium was full of Tottenham fans.
Well, that's the kind of subtle way you can give details
Two of our officers were killed, 47 arrested - DSS.

The Premium Times reported that the incident caused a public outcry after troops and police were deployed to the area where the violent conflict had taken place.
Some of the victims of the incident told reporters that security forces were following their alleged gang members.
A spokesman for the national DSS, Mr. Peter Afunanya, testified that their troops were attacked in Emene, Enugu state.
Peter Afunanya has blamed the IPOB for the attack that resulted in the loss of two of the agency's staff.
Apunaya says that this is the only way to get back.
Ministers of southern Nigeria have called for an investigation into allegations of murder in Lekki.
Nigerian ministers from the southwestern region have called for an investigation into allegations of military shootings on Lekki Road during protests against alleged abuse of police officers.
Minister of Works and Housing Babatunde Fashola said this on behalf of ministers who left the region after a meeting at the presidential palace.
Fashola said that after visiting their areas and doing as required by the president for public interviews they agreed to the need to conduct an investigation to testify to the national community about the facts of the incident.
The minister also said they needed to strengthen the police force and the officers by ensuring that they reduce their burden of protecting public health and property by providing them with state-of-the-art healthcare and equipment.
Ministers from the region included Otunba Adeniyi Adebayo and Olamilekan Adegbite and Sunday Night and Omotayo Alasoadura and Adeleke Mamora.
The Captives Were Freed
Two months after kidnapping several judges in Zamfara state, the defendants released the two judges of the Zamfara state court who had abducted them.
This came two months after they were abducted on their way home from Maradi, Niger.
Reports said that the ransom was paid for one million naira each, before the judges, Salihu Abdullahi and Shafi'u Jangebe, were acquitted.
Each of them was required to pay ten million dollars, but that was not possible.
Then the gunmen called their brothers and demanded that they pay whatever they could.

Aswan village collected, guarded and recovered a load of lost chakuleti candy that fell on its way to Sudan
A truckload of Chakulet goods on its way to Sudan on Sunday stalled the Aswan-Abu road on Sunday, just outside the village of wadi Karkar, where the driver was paralyzed by the heat.

Disaster over disaster: Texas is hit by flooding from Hurricane Hanna and another major coronavirus outbreak
Weather forecasters predict "a disastrous flood" in southern Texas after Hurricane Hanna caused two other peaks to erupt, and caused torrential rain, with strong winds speeding up to 90 miles an hour.
The storm moved forward on Saturday as a Category 1 hurricane (the closest to landfall in five categories) from a low-lying tropical storm to a strong, but it could rain 15 - 30 inches (6-12 inches) on Sunday with winds speeding up to 60 miles per hour.
Some areas have already begun reporting 23 centimetres (9 inches) of rainfall, including Cameron County, on the border with Mexico.
Tropical storm storm is the key to the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, and meteorologist Chris Birchfield warned residents to be vigilant, saying "We have a lot of work to do".
Texas has seen an increase in coronavirus cases in the recent past.
Governor Greg Abbott issued a disaster warning for the 32 districts along the storm's path, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Brazoria.
"Any storm is not a small challenge", he says.
This is a very tough situation, but it's getting worse again because the storm has passed through our front door as we fight the COVID-19 pandemic".
The eruption occurred around 5 p.m. on Saturday, about 15 miles north of Port Mansfield, about 130 miles south of Corpus Christi.
The next occurred near the eastern end of the Kennedy River.
More than 43,700 people in southern Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen, and Brownsville sue, were left without power on Saturday afternoon.
Emergency workers in Corpus Christi have carved out a plan or a sign in the event of a flood.
In a message sent via his ship Tuwita, President Trump said his administration was monitoring Hurricane Hannatare and Hurricane Douglas as it headed for the Hawaiian Islands in the Atlantic Ocean.

Conservative MPs accuse trade union leaders of wanting workers to 'stay home forever'
Conservative members of the British parliament accuse trade union leaders of 'living in the house forever' after they rejected Boris Johnson's call to return to work
Employers were accused last night of wanting workers to "stay in the home forever" after workers listened to Boris Johnson's call for workers to return to work.
Members of the Conservative Party Congress were angered by the marathons after the leaders of the Union of Public Commerce Officers ordered the members of the union to challenge their bosses at work who ordered them to return to work.
Former Minister Andrew Percy said that "we will not accept this" this sector is not a very important public sector that is conducting activities such as issuing travel passports after the employees of private sector companies struggle to feed the country ahead in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.
"We will not allow their absence from work as food distribution facilities and factories continue to operate to feed the public in this situation", he said.
"Most of these workers will complain that they need to go on vacation and that they will not be given because you refuse to return to their previous job and that they can do so without risking themselves.
"The employers will not be able to bring this profit out of remaining at home forever - especially now that we know that workers will be able to return to their jobs safely without risk".
In a call by Britain's Prime Minister, Alex Chisholm, the country's chief of staff, last week told all the prime ministers that "now is the time to shift from the normal work from home to the rush to return to their offices from August 1".
Only when the trade union and social affairs union told its 200,000 children that they did not agree with the order did the union claim that it was a political issue.
A spokesman for PC, Britain's largest public sector trade union, said that "this call for return to work in offices "does not take into account the health of our children" and protects them from the risks and contribute to the national economy.
This call was made in response to political pressure and in parliamentary elections by conservative party members who needed to see that they were using government officials as examples to get everyone to return to office.
"Our advice to members is clear: whenever you are working from home and someone comes to you from work and tells you to go home, do not listen"
The debate comes as concerns about the delay in getting passports due to the work-from-home behaviour of more than 400,000 people who have completed their passport applications are waiting to be issued.
The Interior Ministry now says it will know how "quickly" to check passports from Indigenous people who plan to travel within 14 days and have been waiting for their requirements to be checked at the passport issuing office for more than four weeks.
The PC union admitted that some people had extended their passport requirements for 143 days, but also insisted that "small offices and sometimes busy" prevented the 4,000 office workers from being kept as far apart as possible.
Former cabinet minister David Davis urged trade union leaders to "keep an eye on the situation" and work with the government to find a way to get people back to work.
He then added that since I was in government, the question he would ask the employers was: "What do you think?
Mr. Johnson's appeal to employees to return to their offices, however, did not attract the attention of some of Britain's largest employers.
A survey of companies with 40,000 employees found that only 400,000 workers returned to work.
The Islamic Revolutionary Council wrote a letter to the Inspector General and the Head of the SSS on the killing of Muslims.
The National Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) in Turance has written a letter to Inspector General of Police Muhammad Adama and the Director General of the SSS Security Agency, regarding alleged killings of Muslims in Southeast and Southwest Nigeria.
The NSCIA, the country's highest Muslim-related body, said it was compelled to re-write the letter to the security chiefs following reports of terrorist attacks in the Southwest and Southeast.
In recent weeks there have been reports of attacks on Muslims in Southern Nigeria.
Some images were reportedly posted in online newspapers showing Muslims being attacked with pain and setting fire to their mosque in Orlu, Imo State.
Imo State Police Press Spokesman Ikeokwu Orlando told PREMIUM TIMES that the force should plan everything to ensure that every member of any tribe is protected in the state.
Last week, The Cable newspaper reported on the burning of two mosques in Nsukka, Enugu state, following a tank fire between a Keke NAPEP boy, which caused a family member to be hurt by a conflict between him and the woman, for not paying his bills and taking her away.
But Enugu police spokesman Daniel Ekea said he would not speak until he had confirmed the incident.
A Letter of Concern.
In various letters to the IGP and SSS from the NSCIA, signed by the deputy secretary of the Cabinet, Salisu Shehu, he pointed out that the manner in which the massacre was carried out and the details were disturbing.
He called on security forces to protect lives, property and mosques in the Southeast and Southwest.
The letter also called for an investigation into the cases of property theft.
She also urged security officials to stand up and counter the threat to Muslims and their property in both areas.
The Chinese financial contribution to Nigeria has boosted its economic growth - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Recently, the Nigerian newspaper Vanguard published an editorial entitled "Chinese debt and our independence", stating that the Nigerian parliament has passed Chinese debt agreements, and that the goals of the agreements are in line with international standards.
Chinese loans to Nigeria have helped Nigeria to grow economically and economically, and Nigeria has indeed grown.
The comment also stated that recently, some Nigerians alleged that some provisions in the loan agreements had violated the independence of Nigeria.
In fact, this accusation is baseless, the desire to disregard Nigeria's "national sovereignty" claim is a commitment to pay its debt, does not concern the issue of national sovereignty, nor does it affect Nigeria's sovereignty in any way.
China provides loans on the basis of international trade agreements.
The data shows that China has provided a loan of US$3,121 million to Nigeria, an amount of 3.94% of Nigeria's total debt, and the annual water bill to pay is 2.5%, and the debt will be paid in the long run.
All Chinese loans to Nigeria have been used to build infrastructure projects, such as the Abuja-Kaduna railway, the Abuja city railway, the Lagos-Ibadan railway, the Keffi motorway, and the national airport development program, all of which have created jobs in Nigeria, contributing significantly to the Nigerian economy.
The bones were broken after each attack, and the coronavirus could make the situation worse.
"The outbreak of this pandemic alone is also a sign and an appeal to our elected leaders of the kind of leadership and vision we have had during such a crisis", according to a report produced after interviews with Leonard Steinhorn, a professor of communication sciences at American University, who along with Mark Sobol are authors and experts in management theory.
"But we also face a greater stain of original and domestic sin in this country in relation to rash
The feast gradually descended into the usual elements of the analysis of the uncertainty of the parliamentary situation: a period of mutual hostility that deprived all real mobility, the power of the ruling elite, the need to raise money for them regularly, the lack of solidarity of universities with differing aims and ideals, the negative impact of the media on the daily, day-to-day, and the fact that the main cause of many parliamentarians was voter fraud, and the criticism of their ideologically disadvantaged members.
He also warned that re-launching parliamentary affairs online as a result of the pandemic, such as creating a representative voting system that would allow members of Congress to vote unless they go to Washington, could further destabilize the situation.
If the decision to hold the parliamentary session through a networking system is approved, the report said, it would not be too little to disrupt efforts to achieve integration and cooperation between the different parties.
"The outbreak of the pandemic has forced Congress to conduct most of its internet rental business, and we understand why", the report said.
"But while it is necessary to do so, it is not to be interpreted as being right".
The report goes on to say that Congress needs "reasons for members to meet and negotiate rather than the other way around.
"There is a need for mutual understanding, mutual understanding, and a chance to bridge any gaps and build trust that can lead to a solution to the social problems"
The week that Congressman Ted Yoho and Republican congressman from Florida just beat Democratic congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez from New York and when Republicans beat Congressman Liz Cheney from Wyoming, a family gathering mocked him, raising the need for greater civilization and respect.
Military Killed Police Inspector Whole Nigeria - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
It was discovered that some security guards of a company killed a police officer after he broke the traffic rules in front of the company on Sunday, August 16, 2020.
The nephew of the police officer who interviewed PUNCH on the post and asked for his name to be kept secret, said: "My brother and two policemen refused to comply with the traffic law because of the barrier placed in front of the "Eleme Petrochemical" company, and they were detained by a soldier, even though the dispute between them became a long-distance affair.
One of the soldiers who entered the palace used a cannon and hit my brother in the head, falling to his knees.
He was rushed to the hospital to save his life.
After 24 hours in the hospital, he died.
No one from the police to the military has ever spoken out or taken any action.

This is not the first time the military has taken on the role of a target, either hidden or buried underground, in the ongoing campaign to end the ongoing Boko Haram terrorist group's killing spree in northeastern Nigeria.
A New York City firefighter FDNY official said it was inevitable that a white firefighter would be removed from the agency's front desk
New York City fire department's diversity officials FDNY said it was probably fair to remove a white firefighter from the fire department's coloring parade to leave only black workers to clean the fire, according to a new report.
A white firefighter named Laftanar Daniel Mc Williams filed a lawsuit challenging the racist demonstration after he was removed from the commission's flag-raising ceremony in November 2017 at a memorial service to the victims of the Vulcan massacre.
The same was true of the discrimination and equality officer, and of the lawyer Cecila Loving, who defended this action in a civil rights case in New York City, according to a report by the New York Post.
Mc Williams was one of three firefighters at the FDNY in a historic photo holding the American flag where the long-sleeved arch was destroyed after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
According to the complaint filed by Mc Willaims, he was among those selected by the FDNY's holiday planning agency to hold a raffle at the ceremony to present her colors at the memorial of her victims.
Being one of the flag bearers at the ceremony was 'a little uncomfortable' for Mc Williams, in his lawsuit, as reported by CNN television.
When he arrived at the ceremony, McWillaims was barred from attending the colour induction ceremony held by former Vulcan leader Regina Wilson, who insisted that only black people should be holding flags on the memorial.
Then she asked McWilliams, a 29-year-old former FDNY officer, if he could help her in a different job.'
Her main duties, she said, were to guard the white hats from the party and to arrange for his brothers to be handcuffed in a proper manner and to be escorted out of the party.
MC Willams also in a complaint filed with the court asked if the man who was made of maus fareti was related to his status as a black man.
The university answered yes, according to him.
A 21-year-old firefighter named Wilson who also fought in the 9/11 disaster was the one who produced the replacement McWilliams from among the members of the Vulcan conservative group.
Mc Willams also said she left the party because she could not cope with the violence and humiliation of the village because all the cheating they had done at the home of family and other colleagues was all over the place, reports the New York Daily News.
During the hearing, McWillaims' defense counsel Keith Sullivan asked Lovin - who is black - so the need to discriminate against blacks is not discriminatory?'
'No, it is not,' Lovon said, in a report in the New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loving if it was appropriate to produce a black painting at least as a requirement she said 'excellent and intentional'
In her statement, Loving said it was not wrong to switch blacks from whites to blacks just to promote our distinctive and indigenous languages just to create mutual acceptance and understanding and mutual support in our neighborhoods'
Mc Williams had just filed his complaint of discrimination against him at the FDNY in January 2018.
He later filed a lawsuit against Wilsos and Hkumara FDNY and the New York City Board of Supervisors and other anonymous individuals in May 2019.
After his appeal, Sullivan said that McWillaims had been threatened and restricted by Wilson's supporters.
Until one of my supporters Wilson once stood up to Mr. Williams and said to him 'I've got the word about you, and I've got what you've done, now you've got to blame me.'
In his opening remarks, Mc Williams wrote that removing the fire extinguisher was "a disgusting thing" and a sign of hypocrisy in the fire department.
' If you are black and discriminate against blacks at work, the hardest thing to do is to get a stick in your hand,' Sullivan shares.
According to Wilson's filing, "they were held and allegedly dismissed for an hour" over the same conduct against Mc Williams.
On the other hand, if it was white, it was racial prejudice "on the part of the black man, and severe discipline and punishment", according to Sullivan in his note.
'The FDNY has created itself a system of lawlessness and offers unfounded excuses to eliminate the same kind of Vulcan-based racism, and we must be stopped,' Sullivan also writes.
Agriculture has continued to grow Nigeria's economy, despite the economic pressures.
Agriculture in Nigeria has experienced 24.6% economic growth in the months of April, May to June, compared to the months of January, February and March, and April, May and June 2019.
The National Statistical Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation stated this in its report on Monday.
The agency's data released on Monday showed that Nigeria's domestic economic strength declined sharply in April, May and June 2020.
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the gross domestic product (GDP) of a country's domestic goods and services produced by a country.
Agriculture contributed 24.65 percent in the months of April, May and June 2030, up from the same three months in 2019, with 22.78 percent.
And higher than the months of January, February and March 2020, with 22.96 percent.
That represents a year-on-year increase of 19.90 percent over the three-month period.
That is, if we measure and consider the rising prices and the cost of goods, it is seen that the agricultural sector contributes only 23.9% to Nigeria's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
That is, agriculture has increased economic growth by 1.58% of the national economy as a whole, from 2019 to 2020.
The report said that the agricultural sector was up 6.57 percent compared to its growth between January and March in early 2020.
Agriculture in Nigeria is composed of four areas: food farming, animal husbandry, forestry, and fish farming.
PREMIUM TIMES reported that Nigeria's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was hit with a boom, also known as the boom of well builders, between April, May and June 2020.
NBS noted on Monday that the strict traffic restrictions imposed have caused the Nigerian economy to drive back and forth.
This economic downturn has brought an end to the perceived economic boom that has been in place for almost three years, since Nigeria's economic crisis in 2016.
Gareth Bale's situation at Real Madrid 'is not satisfying for anyone,' says Toni Kroos
Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos said that Gareth Bale's attitude at the Spanish club was "not satisfactory to anyone".
Bale was not seen playing a role in all seven games, and was a different character in Los Blancos' LaLiga celebrations before the summer season was extended as the player wanted to stay with the team and see his contract and the club hoped to leave.
"There is no way to avoid the unsatisfactory situation", Kroos said in an interview with Lauschangriff Endlich mit Sport! a podcast.
"He certainly wasn't signed to play as tight as he is now.
"I think he basically wanted to leave the club last summer and the club said 'yes' on purpose and then 'no' afterwards.
"I don't know if he's still angry about it.
Asked if the incident had had a negative impact on the situation at Real, Kroos said: "It was definitely not as bad as you might have thought.
"Everything was going well in the organization, and I knew him for six years and we had accomplished important things together".

Military destroys and demolishes gun camp in Zamfara state
The air force of the coalition forces fighting in Operation DHABI KADIRI has been targeting a new artillery camp led by a man named Dangote in the Doumborou desert of Zamfara state.
Major General John Enennche, the chief security officer, said the airstrike, which killed several bombers, was carried out after reports from human intelligence (HUMINT) and reliable evidence of aerial espionage.
Major General Enenenche said a man-to-man espionage system called HUMINT ensured that their captors and their basic necessities, their horses and hundreds of stolen cattle, had flown from their former positions to this new location near a hilly area in the forest
Enenche said the air force of the anti-terrorist force had sent a group of Nigerian airmen and heavy-gun helicopters to launch a series of attacks on the camp.

You will see a man in government stealing money to support himself but instead of being punished, you will see him at the top being treated like a government official.
He then commented on how Bribery and Corruption, a public money laundering that has plagued the NDDC.
I personally endured to remain a commissioner on the NDDC board in 2010 due to the crazy government funding being made in the board.
If I could not, I would have collected my own grapes.
But if not forgotten, Kwankwaso himself once fell into the trap of the EFCC after the complaint was filed against him and laundered local government funds up to 3.4 billion naira.
He was accused of forcing local authorities to borrow their money to campaign for him as a presidential candidate at the time, as reported by the Daily Trust.
Not to be forgotten, the NDDC has been under the supervision of national prosecutors, where it investigates the officials of the agency and charges of spending the agency's money between them.
In the survey, it was found that even sharing funds without limitation, in the name of Corona support, also makes them feel cold-cold.

The caption is that I like the Vice President's Paper - Trust - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
The Bauchi government is the main source of this dispute, he said.
Former Speaker of the Federal Parliament of Nigeria, Rt. Hon. Yakubu Dogara has blamed the lies and slander coming out of social media that he will run for vice president in the 2023 elections alongside the National Party Leader of the APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu.
The official testified that the Bauchi state government was promoting the rumors to defame him.
According to him, he is now more focused on the fathers who will bring the country to the fore and seek to overcome the existing problems than on any other issue of seeking a vice president at the moment.
He also said that this was not the time for politics, let alone for such a discussion.
As Confara says, he was initially intent on ignoring such forms of sacrifice, but he realized that those who shouted such lies and gossip were so eager to spread their practices that even other legitimate media were imitating them, so he felt compelled to expose the gossipers to such gossip.
In a speech to the media, Turaki Hassan told the press, advising the public to ignore these lies and propaganda of the masses, because as he said, "the actions are the kind of people who want to stir up disagreements".
"These posts and photos posted on social media, in our view, are some of our own - the top Bauchi state government officials who want to spread the lie that I will run for vice president in the 2023 elections, to satisfy the demand of their householder who is frustrated by the departure of Dhara from the PDP, associate it with that sacrifice", he said.
The Trust's speech also considered that the governor of Bauchi state Bala Muhammad himself had spread the allegations, and continued to spread the myth that he wanted people to make it real in order to paint the Trust black paint, linking and removing the hearts of the public from his indifference to the poor governance in Bauchi state.
Describing these social media lies as baseless and even unreliable, Dogara noted that the 2023 election year is seen as a long-distance affair, so it is not right to present the need to run, because it is time to face the various national challenges to address them.
Dera said he had no knowledge of any political party currently selling the 2023 presidential candidate's ballots, let alone the vice presidential candidate, who is nominated by a standing presidential candidate.
The speaker also boasted that he was the only Yakubu Dogara who was in charge of helping to build up the balance of the entire APC party in Bauchi state, so he demanded that those false accusers let him do the right thing to build up the land.
Our representative quoted that only recently did Yakubu Dogara leave the PDP and join the APC, which has so far been increasingly attracting issues and real opportunities especially for the politics of Bauchi state where it is seen as a political tension between governor Bala Muhammad and Yakubu Dogara.
Hon. Dwara was among those who stood firm in securing the victory of Senator Bala in the seat of governor Bauchi, and surprisingly soon they were handcuffed with a wide-brimmed hat and fell into a political conflict.

The future of the koala nest in north Brisbane falls to the planning court
The council said that besides being a vital habitat for koalas, deer, and gray-haired goshawks, it was a major link between the roads to the Kabejin Tree and the Albany Forest Pass.
Property developers have appealed against the council's approval in the Environmental Protection and Development Court, arguing that the construction of the site complies with the 2014 Urban Planning Act, will also satisfy the urban planning that cannot be achieved, and will meet the needs of the community and can be "implemented without any unacceptable impact".
Strong opposition from the community continues to the current determination to build modern homes.
The builders, while insisting that the project they wanted to do was in line with the urban development plan, argued that the design of the building could be changed to avoid any breach of the rules rather than being restricted from the work itself.
The development as it stands now, includes several phases, including a gas station, a daycare center, and 39 townhouses.
More than 120 people expressed their views during the hearing, most of whom opposed the expansion of the building and the unsuitable location.
BCC opposition leader Jared Cassidy said the parliament needed to buy more land for the protection of the koala.
"The Mayor [Adrian Schrinner] needs to stop the taxpayer's extortion in the city planning court case, and go buy this land to protect Brisbane's wildlife", Cr Cassidy said.
"This is one of the most important forests near the mouth of the Great Rift Valley and home to the great Koala community"
Cr Schrinner this week said the council wants to see the Koala population protected in the town.
"We do not believe that this building program is appropriate for this place", Cr Schrinner observes.
"I understand that this matter is before the court, and we hope what we want to see as a result is a final decision that will make this habitat for these small animals more secure".
Crrinner said the koala residence map is a joint project between the parliament and the state government, where the state government is responsible for the full koala map that the local authorities will use to study applications for permits for modern construction.

In her ruling in her Saturday hearing, Judge Dolly Gee won on her position that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would not release the children in her custody if the three procedures she had drawn did not bring them to her previous conviction on the matter.
But the judge emphasized in the order that the ICE had the right to release the children in due course.
The judge's proposed measures include the joint release of families held by the ICE, the release of the children to a caregiver or the release of families on the basis of a federal court order.
Shalyn Fluharty, director of Proyeco Dilley, an organization that provides legal aid to families in detention, condemned the attempt to allow the ICE to take the decision or to keep children in detention.
"To me", Fluharty says, "it meant that children could be kept safe from harm and had no choice but to be approved by the ICE or the family had agreed to separate beforehand.
Families are held in other detention facilities not supervised by the ICE - Berks in Pennsylvania, south Texas, (Dilley) and Karnes County also in Texas.
The age of children in custody ranges from 1 to 12 years, according to lawyers and legal counsel who provide legal counsel.
- which monitors the implementation of the Flores Gee Convention which prohibits custody of children - says in June that "the failure to properly implement the Convention or the banager-bangera and the refusal to implement the principle of sanctions and the granting of distance", will force the transfer of custody of children to a different location.
There are 969 people in the custody of the ICE with the coronavirus who have either been killed or monitored until July 23, according to the ICE.
Of these figures, there are 25 confirmed cases in Karnes, one in Dillsy, two of the detention centres and families.
In all, more than 3,700 people were found to have been infected while in custody
"doing what is right, but not doing what is right"
Paul Roberts was a former poet and carpenter who became a programmer for the U.S. Space Agency's NASA.
He and his wife, a retired former Nas from Methodist Hospital, who calls herself "nine years younger than ten".
They meet with their two daughters, their sons-in-law, and their seven-year-old grandson each week to play jigsaw puzzles and fun-filled ludos.
"they are wonderful people", says the 38-year-old Roman, about her parents.
Sheryl Roberts, 65, realizes the dangers associated with this disease - she has diabetes, asthma, and heart disease that you can throw at a high risk.
Her husband has a severe lung disease and is carrying a blood clot that will open up the blood vessels.
"We are very careful, very careful and isolated", said Mrs. Roberts.
Her husband began to work from home in the spring when Washington, New York, and other parts of the country were facing a difficult time.
Mr. Roberts once went shopping in a department store in a secluded "old-fashioned" setting that could be described as the "most visible" of the couple's recent months.
Their youngest daughter was also very active.
But from the day she returned home from work, one day in mid-June to June, she was thinking about her body.
She began to cough, get fever, have headaches, diarrhea, and lose her sense of smell, taste, and smell, which were among the symptoms of the coronavirus.
"She told me, 'I don't know what's going on, Mom, and I'm wearing bandages, wearing gloves, and washing my hands,'" Mrs. Roberts said.
"You do everything right, and you're addicted to it".
Elaine Roberts, who was tested positive for the coronavirus, was not seriously ill.
But for her parents, that was worse.
Mr. Roberts and his wife began to vomit, cough, and fever, as did their daughter.
Then he "got sick in a hurry", Sheryl Roberyts recalls.
He was dismissed on June 22.
In a violent way, she tested the strength of his oxygen pump.
The alarm went down, so she called her older daughter of the orderly and took her to the Emergency Department, the second visit in two days.
Gunmen attacked students taking exams in Kaduna.
Reports from Kaduna state in Nigeria said gunmen attacked a school with assault on 7 students and one teacher and killed a schoolteacher.
The source informing the matter said that around 8 am on Monday, gunmen attacked the Prince Academy in Damba-Kasaya village in Chikun municipality of Kadunan state when students of 3rd grade were about to start drawing exams.
Nigerian newspapers reported that the students were among those who were ordered by the Nigerian government to return to schools to take exams.
The newspapers identified the teacher who was abducted by the gunmen as Christianah Madugu while the gunmen identified the victim as Benjamin Auta.
A young Akila Barde who told reporters about the incident said the gunmen entered the village by motorcycles.
Studies show that the number of students ages 12 and up was higher when they were both male and female.
The reasons why the Kano government hired alarms to teach.
The Kano State Government has approved the hiring of 60 teachers to teach in 15 government-sponsored schools to train students in modern education.
The proposal was approved by Kano Governor Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje on Monday.
The approval follows a report from the Board of Islamic Schools in Kano State, headed by Education Commissioner Malam Muhammad Sunusi Kiru.
Governor Ganduje said his government had set up a committee to address the problem of preventing threats on the streets of Kano state, which also planned to create schools that would enable students to combine the Quran with modern technology to improve their lives.
As long as it can be remembered the government has provided schools in the districts of Bunkure, Madobi and Bagwai and 12 other districts in the 44 districts of Kano State.
Cameroon to investigate how $40 million has been spent on COVID-19.
Cameroonian authorities have ordered the launch of an investigation into how the funds of civilian donations were managed as contributions to a special fund to fight the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.
The order came after human rights groups expressed pressure on the investigation, alleging that $40 million of funds and public utilities provided as aid had been stolen.
Their cocaine originated after groups alleged that 4,000 rice packs originally were sold as donations to COVID-19 victims.
However, the country's authorities said that enough medical tests, soaps, disinfectants, mouth and nose pads, medicines and a distribution of water supply across the country were purchased.
President Paul Biya has invested $1.8 million in the fund for the private sector, corporations, ministers and legislators who have contributed.
Cameroon has also received foreign support to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
The government will tighten the ban on access to Aso Rock Hospital.
The Federal Government will take further steps to reduce the number of people admitted to the Aso Rock Palace Hospital.
The secretary general of the presidential palace Tijjani Umar announced this on Thursday.
The government did this to improve the quality of the hospital services.
Umar said that according to the system, the hospital should provide healthcare to the president and his family, the vice president and his family and then the staff of the presidential palace.
In 2015, the government allocated N3.94 billion to the hospital, and the hospital received N3.87 billion in 2016.
In 2017 the government allocated 331.70 billion naira and in 2018 the hospital received 1.03 billion naira.
In 2019, the hospital earned 800 million naira.
That is why President Muhammadu Buhari announced the Government's Plan to restore the prestige of the hospital.
"Servicom National" chief Nnennna Akajemeli said that besides the financial crisis the hospital is suffering from a lack of healthcare staff especially doctors and also from a lack of electricity.
Investigations have revealed that President Muhammadu Buhari and his family are among the people who should be receiving care at this hospital but do not come.
Buyers of the ruins of the lovely Banks' mansions
The phrase "where to buy your business" has become true for the new owners of the Lovely Banks mansion, which was sold for $1.277 million.
Purchasers and those looking for a luxury accommodation not far from the center of Gelong have wandered to see a large house in the center of a 1.35-acre park with 14 parking lots and a swimming pool, and a view of the Corio beach.
Harcourts Company, Geelong re-owner Joe Grgic said one of the top 1 Cuddihy Court properties was bought 10 days after it was put on the market.
Ocean Groves repaired Broome's house and put it on the market
Housing that is suitable for private use
"We received offers from many people from all walks of life and from all walks of life", Mr. Grgic said.
"We sold it to a man who was very happy".
It was a two-story, four-room apartment with a large living room that could accommodate a long chair.
The new owners will enjoy three spaces, a refurbished kitchen, and a park on the courtyard overlooking a swimming pool.
"It's a taste of solitude and the pleasures of life, being the place of a 3 acre man and not being anywhere else", says Mr. Grgic.
"I've met some customers from Melbourne who have come here, full of wonder at its proximity to everything and everything, but it also has something rural.
"I have people who are reluctant to buy the place, and there are still buyers who are reluctant".
He said the large shed, which included two parking lots and a tent that could hold 10 to 12 cars, was suitable for small cars and passengers who were stuck in a car for recreation.
A radio host in Seattle who blamed President Trump for his response to the protesters, has now returned to say that I need a gun after a barbeque was made against the Starbucks tea shop under the floor where he was.
Paul Gallanta has made a similar statement to the horrific protests in Seattle after he blamed Domald Trump in June for allegations that rioters and rebels had burned down and plundered the city.
Soon, the mob came close to the radio host's house.
"I felt the need to own a gun because it made it clear that this was the way it was going to happen", Gallant said on his Twitter account on Saturday night after returning home and finding a Starbucks teahouse under his roof "banned".
"That was enough, and I felt like a community meeting after the meeting had ended.
The response came in the face of a clear-cut debate where Trump last month complained that the mayor of Seattle had turned away protesters in a violent attempt to seize the city.
"These liberal people don't know what they're doing", he says.
"These terrorists have burned and plundered our cities, even in their graves"
Gallant, who hosts the show Danny & Galant on Seattle's ESPN, responded on his Twitter account: "I went on a sightseeing tour last night, and I didn't see any con-kones, or public transportation, or loss of life.
"The police warned Galant who had been stabbing his home because of the crash that maybe a blacksmith was planted in his country's Starbucks teahouse with a grass-roots gang.
Gallant sent photos of the protestors' burning, saying "the work was fine in - except" and then went on to say that he saw a fire burning a short distance away.
"I don't know what's going on, but we're going to the spy lab to find out what's going on".
Gallant's quick-talking was a big deal, with conservative politicians often annoying Gallant over what he had said earlier, tweeting "go ahead" and "yeah, maybe Trump is right".
"Of all the signs we've got, we're going to end up going around the same place", says Jason Rants, a radio host in Seattle.
Gallant recognized the joke of the re-maritalist: "Today I woke up to a series of tweets from other people saying 'just give me your ear' and I was laughing".
He said he was on his own arrow based on what he had said, as he was walking through an autonomous region that the rebels had been waiting for after they realized and discovered that it had not been as they had hoped.
"And therein lies the burning and the plundered".
Israelis continue to protest against the country's Prime Minister's crackdown on the pandemic
JERUSALEM (AP) - Thousands of Jews held a series of nationwide protests against Prime Minister Netanyahu on Saturday, as a massive demonstration took place in Jerusalem at the doorstep of Benjamin Netanyahu's home.
She held protests for weeks, on what critics saw as the government's failure to deal with the violent response to the coronavirus pandemic after initially being the country's biggest threat.
Netanyahu's allegations of bribery have fueled the protests.
"Go home", a note held by a protestor said.
Another inscription says "everyone thought the king was in the tube and had thrown his clothes away"
Hundreds of protesters gathered on Saturday at the front door of Netanyahu's home in a slum in the city of Caesarea.
Last week, the police used a strong tap of water to disperse a crowd in Jerusalem.
Following a so-called emergency decision filled with economic openings in May, the number of cases increased by an estimated new cases per day at 2,000.
The country's economy has been hit hard by the pandemic and the unemployment rate rising to around 20%.
Protesters say government subsidies are not reaching their full potential.
The rally comes after Netanyahu was charged with bribery charges that will continue this month.
The trial will resume in January.
He is accused of fraud, treason, and taking bribes in a series of outrageous acts.
Maurice Pretty, an engineer and mechanical engineer, a member of the hall of fame, has died at the age of 81.
Kansas City, Kansas (AP) Maurice Pettu, a descendant of the legendary race car family that included the legendary Lee and grandfather Richard and the first engineer and builder to be inducted into NASCA's Hall of Fame, died Saturday.
He was 81 years old.
Petty's family did not disclose the cause of her death.
No announcement of his funeral arrangements
While his other brothers were outstanding in their skill and skill in handling the steering wheel, Maurice Petty earned the title "master" because of his skill in handling the steering wheel.
He helped their home win 198 races and the NASCA Championship Series championship and called the engines and drivers of the Hall of Famers Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal, and Hamilton rode, leading to victory and fame.
"The king is one of the most talented engineers and repairers in NASCAR history", according to president and chief executive officer Jima France.
"He has provided the strength that has helped Petty Enterprises ensure its sustainable growth in the racing industry.
While making a name for himself in his underground work, Maurice played a key role behind the scenes, doing what he knew was helping to drive his cars to success"
Maurice Petty was born on March 27, 1939, in a place called Level Crossing, North Carolina.
As a young man, he followed his father to the race course, gradually becoming close to the Lee Petty team that won 54 races and three championships.
He competed in 26 NASCAR Cup races from 1960 to 64, where he reached the 5th position five times, where he finished 16th in the SMA and 100 race.
But he quickly decided to focus on what was under the car rather than what was behind the wheel, and this proved to be a good idea for his younger brother, who would rely on his engine power to achieve success
Richard, who was awarded the title "King" won his first championship with the manager while driving at the Playmouth Championship until the 1964 title-winning race.
They won the tournament again in 1967, again in 1970 and 71 , and repeated the same success in 1970 which ended the event,
Seven races were won by Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson until the end of history
"Maurice Petty was one of the original founders of NASCAR who helped build one of the most dominant NASCAR players at Petty Enterprises". Hall of Fame president and general manager Winston Kelly said in a statement,
"Although the data store has reported 212 successes, Petty has more than 250 successes that he knows of considering that all the machines he has built are for his clients.
We will always remember the king as one of the most successful engine manufacturers in NASCAR.
Lee petty died in 2000 Patricia, wife of Maurice Petty, who was married to him for 52 years, died in 2014
He is also the uncle of former driver and broadcaster Kyile Petty and Trent Owens, the long-term staff chairman of Truck
Kelley continues, "as we lose one of the original members and heroes of NASCA's achievements we will remember, protect and nurture them.
"to extend our deepest condolences to the Petty family"
CAR president-elect Francois Bozize announces his intention to run for president again
The incumbent President of the Central African Republic Francois Bozize on Saturday announced his intention to run again in the December presidential election despite UN sanctions and possible arrest for war crimes charges.
He made the announcement in a speech to thousands of his supporters at a party rally Kwa na Kwa (employee only owner) in the capital Bangui.
Bozize, 73, is a former army general and the head of the country's military and a coalition of 2013 Muslim-led rebel groups from the north of the country that led to a coup that plunged the predominantly Christian country into a war zone and a serious refugee crisis that has yet to be resolved.
"This country needs an experienced man who loves peace and justice". Bozize said in a speech that he also delivered to the chairman Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozie led the country after a 2003 coup and ruled for 10 years before fleeing the country in 2013.
The coup was a request for arrest for alleged war crimes and genocide, but he has not been arrested since returning from exile at the end of last year.
He did not know how his arrest permits and foreign restrictions could affect his candidacy.
In late January, Bozize said that he would need to lift the ban on his arrest on charges that he supported the Christian Anti-Balaka group in 2014.
Touadera is now in charge of a large UN peacekeeping force of 13,000 police and military personnel.
He was elected in 2016 and is expected to run for a second term in the upcoming election although this has not yet been confirmed.
The first round of the campaign was scheduled to begin on December 27.
In February 2019 the government of the country signed a peace treaty with 14 other armed groups claiming to protect the interests of a particular ethnic or religious group.
The protests have already calmed, with a series of violent protests and a seemingly constant struggle over national wealth, while the majority of the country's diamond wealth is in non-governmental areas.
This violence forced more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes.
Kano Assembly rejects the passing of a corruption law - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
Kano state legislature has denied that it has passed a law on the rape of people arrested for rape.
Member of parliament representing the local government Dala Lawan Husaini Chediyar "Guryan-Gurasa said this in an interview with the freedom radio station.
He said the bill was introduced to the parliament in the past few days, and then the public opinion was heard before any action was taken on the matter.
He added that the bill would be thoroughly scrutinised before it could be approved.
The member added that stakeholders including teachers and rulers would play a role in the ratification of the bill.
Kaduna government seizes grocery stores under the Corona law - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
The Ministry of Commerce, Innovation and Technology of Kaduna State has seized 6 food and beverage stores for violating the regulations to protect against infection from the coronavirus.
The food stores and grocery stores were closed and the ministry was monitoring to ensure that the Corona restrictions were applied in the appropriate places to protect against COVID-19.
The National Press Agency reported that the commissioner's team visited the Otel-Otel and the restaurants and grocery stores of Kaduna state.
Kaduna State Commerce and Technology Commissioner Samuila Idris-Nyam announced that the ministry's staff visited 16 shopping malls and arrested 6 of them for criminal offences.
Racist protesters clash with police in Seattle
A clash between police and racist protesters led to numerous arrests on Sunday, as public anger escalated over Donald Trump's plan to "increase" the number of federal security guards in major cities.
The series of protests against racial discrimination and police brutality stemmed from the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed African-American in Minneapolis in May.
Protesters in Seattle cut through the tires of cars and shattered their windows during the demonstration on Saturday, prompting the police to launch a riot and disperse them by opening the streets with spraying of old people's beds and picking up small explosives.
Protesters rented some vans of construction companies that were building a swarma center to hold young people.
Police said 45 people were arrested while 21 police officers were injured.
A crowd in support of such a protest was in nearby Portland, Oregon.
Portland became a center for the state and federal security forces who, at Trump's behest, withdrew the rescue, one of which was not supported by city officials who said excessive force was used.
Protesters took to the streets in Austin, Texas; Louisville, Kentucky; New York; Omaha, Nebraska; Oakland, California; Los Angeles; and Richmond, Virginia.
In Austin, a man was killed in a shooting that broke out Saturday night during a protest in the center of the Texas capital, according to police.
The protests came after Trump faced a tough challenge to seek re-election in November, and during his campaign focused on "ensuring law and order".
The campaign committee refused to interview Fox News on its Sunday Interview program, a week after Chris Wallace's presidential race against Trump
In an interview with Chris Wallace last week, President Trump asked if Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden could have the same series of questions Wallace is asking President Trump.
The answer to that question - at this time - is that we do not know the answer yet.
On Sunday Wallace informed his viewers that Joe Biden's campaign committee had told Fox News that he would "not be able to attend" his interview program.
"In an interview with President Trump last week, he asked whether or not his opponent's Democratic presidential candidate, the Democratic Party, could have such a questionable question", said Walace.
"This week, we contacted Joe Biden's campaign committee for a special interview and they said the former vice president would not be able to attend".
He added, "We will continue to ask him every week".
President Trump's re-election campaign committee has been criticizing Biden for months for avoiding campaign meetings and press conferences during their campaign, continuing to interview journalists amid the coronavirus pandemic.
While Biden has recently returned to his backbone, Trump and his associates continue to accuse the former vice president of "hiding" in his Delaware home.
But Biden's patience with the rallies was not bad enough to see and that caused his blood to spill, as a public opinion poll showed that Biden had deliberately given President Trump a full national and other key states to run for office.
The results of the white-blooded poll of my politician clearly show that President Trump scored less than 7 points in Florida, 6.7 points in Pennsylvania, 8.2 points in Michigan, and 6.4 points in Wisconsin.
Trump narrowly defeated these four states in 2016, shifting their vote from blue to yellow, the same as he did in the White House election.
A recent Fox television news story said Biden was the front runner in Minnestown, Michigan, and Pennsylvania where they fought.
The election results suggest that Biden is slightly ahead in Ohio, North Carolina, Arizona and three other major ponytails states in this round.
Another study also found that formerly some states with a red-collar political system such as Texas and Georgia now have all the fights between Trump and the former vice president.
The presidential election in which the winning president is running for a second term in office at the White House is sometimes seen as a measure of popularity for the president, and the 2020 election rivalry between Trump and Biden is seen as such.
The key issues are the coronavirus pandemic and the national economy that the pandemic has affected severely and the steps the president has taken to address them.
The government has given a high-priestly holiday.
The federal government has declared Thursday 30 and Friday 31 of this month as holy days of fasting.
The announcement was made by the Minister of Interior Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola through the ministry's secretary general, Georgina Ehuriah.
The minister also congratulated the Nigerian Muslim community at home and abroad on the celebration of the cycle of the great prayer, and the celebration of the holy days of prayer.
The minister urged the public to be vigilant in applying the Corona laws in the celebration of the holy days.
Rauf Aregbesola added that the successful government of President Muhammadu Buhari is in compliance with the established laws and promoting peace among the people of the country.
White Star star Laura Haddock, 34, goes on a quest for a home with her ex-boyfriend Tom Rhys Harries, 28,
They were initially romantically involved in the production of White Lines, a drama about the life of a shark on the island of Ibiza - but from the day Laura Haddock and her boyfriend Tom Rhys Harries went to find a place to stay last week, they emerged as a peaceful, different person from the life of his commentator in the show.
Fans appearing as the heroes in the popular Netflix sponsorship show were seen when they went to see a beautiful Oxfordshire dog farmhouse for £1.2 million.
They arrived in a Range Rover driven by Laura, 34, wearing a denim shorts, and a white shirt where a dealer had let them into a five-bedroom luxury apartment to spot their eyes.
In the show 'White Lines' which was filmed with her grandmother, Zoe Walker who appeared in Laura, discovers the life of an Ibiza commentator while investigating the murder of her brother Axel, a 28-year-old DJ who appeared in Tom.
Their love story was not revealed until earlier this month, less than a year after her six-year divorce from Sam Claflin, when they appeared in the movie 'The Hunger Games.'
They had a four-year-old son named Pip and a two-year-old daughter named Margot.
When they announced their divorce last August, 34-year-old Claflin wrote on his Instagram account: "Laura and I have decided to end our marriage.
Laura and Sam first met in 2011 at an audition, and Sam, who appears in the series 'Peaky Blinders', described their 2013 marriage as "a huge success in his single life".
Prior to 'White Lines' Laura first appeared in several television programmes and the BBC drama series "The Capture" where she appeared as Lawyer Hanna Roberts.
Tom also appeared in the development of the show 'Inbetweeners' and a spin-off of the TV series 'Britannia' for SKY.
Attacks on Nigerian Media Are Worrying - The United Nations.
The United Nations and the United Kingdom have described the increasing attacks on news outlets and press in Nigeria as a major concern.
The United Nations and the British government therefore called on the authorities to stop any pressure on the press and its staff, which was necessary because the authorities would be held responsible for the violence.
This was explained by the British Ambassador to Nigeria, Catriona Laing, on Monday in celebration of the 2020 International Press Crime Day.
The ambassador-general posted a message on his Twitter page saying that the creation of a fully independent media department is mandatory for every government.
The press should not be forced, nor should attackers be attacked.
The UN press director in Nigeria, Ronald Kayanja, also said that on such a crucial day it was necessary to declare the protection of the press and media.
Kayanja said the attacks on media outlets and media workers were a major concern, so he called on the authorities to investigate allegations of such abuse in order to uphold justice and fairness.
Kayanja said another step to eliminate the spread of fake news was through the strengthening of independent media.
Just as support is being provided to other sectors of the economy, to rebuild them and their capacity, it would be good for the media to be supported, we have just reported that at least three media outlets were burned during the riots to end SARS, with several journalists injured while on their job telling the world where the protests were taking place.
HOW TO PRAY: The people of Abuja should hold the Passover Prayer in the nearby Friday mosques.
Abuja's minister, Muhammad Bello, urged the residents of Abuja to celebrate the feast prayer in the nearby Friday mosques instead of rushing to the festival grounds.
Bello said in a letter shared with the press by the chief media officer of his ministry, Anthony Ogunleye, on Tuesday in Abuja.
He told them to run to the nearby mosques to pray instead of to the festival grounds.
Bello said the government took this step after discussing with the community of the poor on a plan to help protect the public health from the coronavirus pandemic during the mass prayers.
Bello then called on the teachers to devise measures to help prevent crowds from entering mosques.
Then do not spend an hour in prayer.
The Federal Government has granted Thursday 30 July and Friday 31 July as the High Prayer days and has also urged Nigerians to observe the rules and regulations for the prevention of coronavirus that the government and the NCDC have established during the High Prayer days.
Abuja is one of the places where the number of coronavirus cases is increasing in Nigeria.

The Buhari administration has sent 601 Boko Haram militants to their homes.
On Saturday, President Muhammadu Buhari's administration sent 601 Boko Haram militants to their homes after six months of being brainwashed into terrorism.
The funeral was held at the Boko Haram Counterterrorism Centre in Malam Sidi, Kwami Municipality, Gombe State.
The training is provided as a hands-on training and training program under the "De-radicalisation Reintegration and Reorientation" (DRR) program, under the "Operation Safe Corridor" program, which is to arrest or kill and then repent without further action.
Major General Bamidele Shafa, the program's head, said the 601 to be rescued were the fourth group of Boko Haram to be rescued after conversion.
He said that these had been registered in the camp for six months, and that since December, they had been trained in moral values.
Originally, there were 606, but three died in the center of a hospital after a stroke before they had a balcony.
One of them was arrested for some reason, charged, and the other was sent to a hospital.
587 are Nigerians, 14 are Nigerians, followed by Chad and Cameroon.
Delegates and representatives spoke at the event, including the Chief of National Security, Abayomi Olanisakin, Governor Babagana Zulum of Barno and Minister of Relief, Compassion and Improvement of the Lives of the Disabled, Sadiya Faruq.
How 602 Boko Haram fighters have pledged to the Buhari government to stop terrorism.
Two weeks ago, PREMIUM TIMES published an article about 602 Boko Haram militants who pledged to the Government to repent of their terrorist activities.
Recall Your Past Violence, Repent, and Go Your Own Way.
Americans Will Finish the Presidential Election.
Americans continue to wait for the final results of the presidential election.
Now the focus has shifted to other states, where provisional results are showing little, and they can be very influential in determining the winner between the Democratic candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden and the Republican winning President, Donald Trump.
In New York, a countdown was required as the country waited to hear who had won.
People across the country, including Pennsylvania, attended one of the protests.
The counting of votes is still going on in a few important areas.
But after Joe Biden was declared the winner of Michigan and Wisconsin - two states that President Trump won four years ago - Biden said he was confident he would get at least 270 Electoral College Votes, the required number to win the election.
Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate, said, "I'm not here to say we won the election, I'm here to say that when the vote count is over, we believe we will win".
Georgia, traditionally a Republican state, is one of the few places where Biden's support in surrounding cities is seen as a potential victory.
As the vote count was being prepared, President Donald Trump tweeted Wednesday that he was declaring victory in Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, and Michigan, a claim that Twitter described as "uncertain".
Trump's campaign committee plans to appeal the decision to the Michigan and Pennsylvania counts, arguing that the Republican Party is not allowed to fully monitor the counting process.
President Donald Trump said, "We're going to the US Supreme Court.
We want to stop any counting of votes.
We do not want them to get another vote at four o'clock in the morning to add to the number of votes.
"Each candidate has the right to recall if the margin of victory is less than one percent", says political scientist Willaim Howell of the University of Chicago.
But historically, a recounting of votes has not produced the same numbers as the first, so a recounting does not necessarily produce the desired results.
Hundreds of Trump supporters protested at a polling station in Phoenix, Arizona, late Wednesday, alleging irregularities in the counting of some votes.
The final outcome of Arizona and the other races will be decided by the court.
South Africa: Prince Ashwell and Marsha Cox speaking about their racial background
A few weeks ago she revealed that there were some hidden and outspoken stigmas surrounding racism in South African sports.
Required meaningful discussion and immediate action are needed to create a physical atmosphere for everyone.
Former Proteas international cricket defender Aswell Prince has lashed out at his former white teammates for showing prejudice against him and other black players by calling them "bad players".
Prince has described white Proteas players as "black players".
He added that it is sad that even the most famous black players like Makhaya Ntini and Kasigo Rababa who have achieved fame in the game, still continue to be given this disgraceful name by some people.
Prince, who is the head coach of the Cape Cobras franchise, said this at an online seminar hosted by the Union of Sports and Community Organizations (UCSBO) on Thursday night.
The group sought to expand the debate on racial discrimination in sports in South Africa that had its roots in the country's history.
"As I said in my social media posts, I didn't mean to go out and hide the name of people, but these things really happened...
The U.S. Election is now under review.
But Americans are still waiting for the results of the election in some competing states, to decide whether the winning President Donald Trump will continue to lead the country, or his Democratic opponent former Vice President Joe Biden will replace him.
The event was held in Washington, D.C.
And Miami, Florida, on Tuesday night, as the presidential election results are being held between incumbent President Donald Trump and his Democratic opponent Joe Biden.
No candidate has yet received 270 of the 538 votes cast by the electorate's special representatives, which is required before a candidate can win the election.
It is the American electoral system, not the number of votes a candidate receives in the general election.
Jeremy Myer, a lecturer at George Mason University in the United States.
"There were signs of head-on collisions between the two candidates", he said.
Surprisingly, this election is almost as if the 2016 election is happening again, a trend that will repeat itself in the three states of Winsconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
The original states of Winsconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania were Democratic states, which Trump won in the 2016 election.
Both candidates campaigned in the districts in the last days before the election.
Early this morning Wednesday, from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, Biden called on his supporters to be more patient.
Keep on Believing, and we will succeed!
Thank you thank you.
Shortly after, in a tweet, Trump responded with a man-to-man reaction, claiming Democrats were trying to steal the election, a message Twitter described as likely to cause confusion.
But later, he came out of the White House and spoke.
This was a sad thing, in my opinion, a time of anxiety.
But we will succeed, even if we feel that we have already succeeded.
Even if the president claims to win, the vote counting will continue, and it may take days for the winner to be determined.
LaTrice Washington, is a Professor at the University of Otterbein.
"Due to the Covid-19 pandemic", she said, "we have seen more people send their votes by post".
As a result, more people were required to vote in this way, which would cause a delay in the election (counting).
Americans conducted their elections peacefully, despite the police being installed in some polling stations, while security officials remained in the planning stages, after a long campaign that heated up the heads of the public was over.
While the recounting process in several other states, and the court cases on electoral rules, may have influenced the counting of votes, the months-long U.S. election campaign must take time to see its end.
Five Members of the Royal Council Resigned at Zamfara.
The Shinkafi Kingdom in Zamfara State in northern Nigeria, appointed Femi Fani kayode, the former Nigerian Minister of Air Transport, as the ruler of Sadaukin Shinkafi, a move that did not please the Shinkafi community.
Five members of the Imperial Council resigned to protest the appointment of King Muhammad Makwashe.
Dr. Tijjani Salihu, a member of the royal council, and a professor at Usman Dan Fodio Sokoto University, told the US Voice that he had resigned from his position as "Father of the Shinkafi Marriages" because according to him the northern enemy of Nigeria had been given the throne, and a vocal critic of the Muslim monarch, and that was sad.
Alhaji Sulaiman Shu'aibu, who resigned as "king of Shannon Shinkafi", also explained to the US voice representative why he resigned, saying he did not approve of Femi Fani's appointment to the Shinkafi Senate, as he had long criticized the north and its leaders.
He added that Sadauki's rule was a noble one, in which any ruler could dedicate his life and property to the local people, their religion, culture and society, and to protect the dignity and interests of those communities.
Special adviser to the governor of Zamfara state, Alhaji Zailani Baffa told the US voice representative that the government does not elect any governor.
Disabled, homeless women in Chennai's anti-COVID-19 force
Shantri, a disabled seamstress, visits 250 homes every day to identify people with symptoms among people living in Kodambakkam, a Corona-affected neighbourhood in Chennai with about 10,000 infected people.
Each day she would start out at about 7:30 a.m. and finish her tour at about 4:00 p.m.
She examines the body temperature of the men in the neighborhood, asks them questions about the symptoms and spread of the disease and raises awareness about the importance of restrictions, frequent hand washing, and distance.
Her efforts helped to identify and cure four infected people early.
Six of the 16,000 employees of the Chennai-based company who are not health workers who go door-to-door are being tested.
This effort, according to my expert, has led to a 50% reduction in the number of daily cases while the numbers are rising in some parts of Tamil Nadu.
Shanthi said that not all residents of the area were supportive of her.
She added: "Most people are more cooperative when they see women with disabilities helping them.
Others were upset.
I won't worry.
My only wish is that people are not at risk of infection.
If I visited them the next day, they would be very humble.
Having a clear understanding helps".
There are many other Shanthi communities that live where the agency has provided shelter for homeless women with disabilities, especially in the fight against COVID-19.
A short distance from Kodambakkam, Kavita who is disabled joined her contribution as a monitor.
Although Kavitha uses a special wheelchair, she walks with the help of two other rods that enable her to meet people.
"I'm happy", she adds, referring to the decline in the number, but she adds: "I wish that number had dropped to about 100 a day.
And I have the confidence that we can do that".
On the ground floor of the homeless shelter, where they both live, MatildaFunceca, a wheelchair-bound basketball player, and Manimekalai, a schoolteacher, send information sent to them by about 40 women to the company's database.
Matilda said that she was not afraid of contracting the coronavirus.
"With the help of others, God will protect us", she adds.
When asked about their defences, Manimekalai explained: "I put on restrictions and then give time off and wash my hands often.
I also drink Kabasura Kudineer, a Siddha-protective drink".
A few months ago during the Coronavirus outbreak in Chennai these women-in-waiting women used their time and skills to hand-stitch the sanitation workers in the city.
Dabkta Aiswanya Rao, director of the Dorcas Oil Research and Production Institute, said: "They are providing assistance in accordance with the needs of the region.
Yes, restrictions were needed and they tried to produce it.
Now the nation needs to be strengthened and not weary".
In the case of coronavirus cases in Tamil Nadu, the number of new cases in 24 hours has risen to 2,989 in the last 24 hours, which is also the highest increase in a single day, according to government figures.
Eighty-nine people died, while 7,758 had recovered from the disease in the past 24 hours.
The total number of cases in the state now stands at 2,06,737.
Or would Prince Andrew be on the list of the most embarrassing prospects?
The kingdom plans to respond to a possible bank robbery planned on the basis of some of the court documents against its youths Jeffery Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
A judge in the United States orders the disclosure of confidential documents relating to Epstein and Maxwell
An 80-page document containing portions of Maxwell's testimony in 2016
The release of the documents could put Prince Andrew under pressure because they contain some letters between Maxwell and Epstien from January 2015
Virginia Roberts, who is accused of being a shy wealthy businesswoman, claimed that in 2015 in court documents that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew
The prince planned to fight the possibility of releasing this week a series of disgraceful myths about his relationship with child molester Jeffery Eptein and alleged co-conspirator Ghislain Maxwell.
U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska last week ordered the release of 80 pages of confidential legal documents, which reached hundreds of pages related to Maxwell and Epstein.
Publishing these documents would be a major disadvantage for 58-year-old Maxwell, as they contained many of the pieces of evidence she gave to lawyers in 2016, including what her lawyers called "coconut questions" about her public life.
This could also lead to pressure on Prince Andrew because one of the documents contained letters between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015 when Virgina Roberts, a suspected wealthy businesswoman, claimed that she had, as contained in the court documents, been forced to have sex with Prince on three separate occasions.
The prince stood firm, and he repeatedly denied the claim.
In a 2015 email that was also broadcast by the BBC, I pointed out that Andrew had sought Maxwell's help on how to deal with Virginia Roberts' allegations about him.
We have no doubt that the truth of the Duke's succession will be revealed
In it, he said to the public park official: "Let me know when we will talk. I have some questions I want to ask you about Virginia Roberts".
"I have some information", Maxwell replied, "so call me whenever you have time".
Last night, according to a source close to Andrew, the Prince of York's chief justice did nothing to condemn the act of God, so we had nothing to worry about regarding the release of some of the Court documents.
As U.S. courts struggle to prove, merely having a case filed in court does not make the allegations true.
"The U.S. courts have urged the media and the public to be very careful about any allegations contained in the court documents.
We agreed with the congregation.
We had no idea that the prince would come out and be washed away in the next few weeks".
Maxwell is currently in the Manhattan detention center, awaiting trial for allegedly abducting and arranging some of the minors that Epstein obtained between 1994 and 1997.
He was also charged with perjury and perjury for failing to recognize the legal status of his assault.
She denied all the accusations.
Some lawyers interviewed her in April and July 2016 in part of a case involving Miss Robert's name, who now goes by the name of her husband Giuffre.
About 40 of the 418 pages of evidence submitted were also made public last year, but following the verdict of Judge Preska in New York, some sections may be released by Thursday.
Maxwell's lawyers were given a week to appeal.
Epstein's body was found in his cell in his New York prison last year, where he died awaiting a verdict on sexual charges.
MOPPAN Emphasizes the Need for Mercy
It was restored by the Kano Film Board, the filmmakers said.
The Motion Picture Practitioners Association of Nigeria, also known as MOPPAN, has reiterated its role in expelling one of the most prominent actresses in the Hausa film industry, Rahama Sadau, after a man assaulted the Prophet (SAW) on charges of posting a nude photo of the actress while she was also commenting.
As long as it can be remembered, the heroine Rahama Sadau has faced opposition and criticism from the Muslim community and Hausawa as well as from several of her business associates for posting a photo of her naked bed in Tiwita, an incident that attracted controversy among followers of different religions, after a commentator, who allegedly was not a Muslim, molested the Prophet of Allah.
This led to a poster entitled "Assistant Allah", which was allegedly the first to use the words in an attempt to express her displeasure and criticism of the image's depiction by others, who said it was contrary to the teachings of Islam, which she followed.
After the alleged abuser of the Apostle made his own comments and attracted even the attention of the film industry in Northern Nigeria, the film crew's mother emerged and distanced herself from the hero.
In a statement from the group's National Chairman, Dr. Ahmad Sarari, the signatory of the group's Public Relations Officer, Al-Amin Ciroma, yesterday, she denounced Rahama's actions, saying that she would have been a hero of the group, unless only the Kano State Film Board (KSCB) under the leadership of Isma'il Na'abba Afakallahu had recovered her.
The group recalled that since 2016 it had fired the hero from the industry for violating the group's rules of infertility after she had gone out for a month with their Classic Musicians hugging each other.
"The mother of the film industry association in Northern Nigeria, MOPPAN, known as Kannywood, is frustrated with the postponement of the image by the legendary heroine, Rahama Sadau, on the platform of the social network", the photo of the fight spread on the shoulders, the statement said.
The film attracted a lot of criticism, which even led to the abuse of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) in Tibet and other modern media.
This practice is God-dishonored in the MOPPAN organization.
As long as you can remember, about four years ago, on October 2, 2016, the mother of the group fired Sadau from the industry, but after about two years the KSCB Board asked for her forgiveness, despite the fact that Kano is the largest Hausa film production center in the world.
"Two years after the expulsion, the Kano State Film Board (KSCB) was formed by its head, Prof. Isma'il Na'Abba Afakkallah", said MOPPAN.
On January 8, 2018, the organization pardoned Rahama for all alleged misconduct, and allowed her to re-establish in Kannywood, a move challenged by the Kano State MOPPAN Branch on January 15, 2018, under the leadership of the branch's head, Malam Kabiru Maikaba.
The statement added, "in the current situation, MOPPAN is reaffirming its original position on Rahama Sadau with an appeal to all Kannywood organisations to ensure the implementation of the order".
MOPPAN then appealed to all professionals in Kannywood and other Hausa communities at home and abroad, to know that the organization has already distanced itself from Rahama Sadau and any other postings that may arise now or in the future.
The people were again shocked when the heroine refused to remove her message and pictures until about days later.
But after things got hotter, the heroine removed and yesterday afternoon appeared on social media by posting a video of her distance from herself and commenting on the abuse of the Prophet (SAW) by the messenger, although it seems Sadau did not come out clearly and responded that it was a crime to post the photo from the beginning.

Google Pixel 4 mobile phone that you can take a picture of the sky
In addition to the additional 2x near-distancing tractor, the second camera gave the Pixel 4 camera the ability to see the image in 3D format; thus blurring anything behind the photographer in portrait format, which thus beat the previous type of phone call, which they relied on to obtain this kind of favor called "bokeh" in the photo.
To further increase public confidence in this photography feature, Google invited Annie Leibovtz, a prominent photographer, to a conference hall to explain to the public how she enjoyed working with the Pixel4 handheld camera over the past 12 months.
The use of machine learning has been the focus of Google's new mobile phones, the company relies on statistical and mathematical methods in computational photography to improve image quality and has produced HDR+ levels by combining nine different images into one image.
A new type of image optimization provides a different key to improve light and shade that allows the photographer to see the image before HDR+ releases the image directly.
The phone also relies on a machine learning system to improve the white out-of-this-world, black out-of-this-world capability of the camera to capture images of the constellations in the dark at night and to produce orbits.
In addition to the second camera, the Pixel 4 comes with a new technology called a 'radar chip' in which the user can switch on music, turn off signal notifications, turn off the alarm, and silence the phone with just a handshake.
Any computer technology that detects mobile traffic, rather than the Internet, has improved its 'Google Assistant' functionality which shows how much the company's focus is on shortening the time it takes to receive orders and protecting the privacy of the mobile user.
Google's insistence on taking advantage of 'Machine Learning' technology was fueled by the introduction of a new voice recognition device that could convert voice audio directly to text without sending it over the Internet.
Currently, this program is available only in English, and more languages are expected in the future.
The Pixel4 is the first smartphone to feature the Google Stadia game series and will be launched on November 19 in the United States and is expected to launch in Australia soon.
In addition to the new Pixel phones, Google's campaign has released the latest 'Pixelbook Go Chromebook' laptop and 'Google Pixel Buds' headset.
Which is expected to be released next year, but in addition to Australia, the new Bluetooth 5.0 headset features adaptive audio technology that automatically controls the audio to increase or decrease without touching it regardless of where you are.
The new Bluetooth headset 5.0 is wireless, incorporating modern technology that increases and decreases the volume of what you hear, depending on where you are.
On the other hand, Google has announced the release of a new 'Nest Wifi' small internet messaging distributor that is integrated to work in one place to provide wireless internet access in the home.
By using the name 'Nest' the new device doubles the distance and power where the message will go than the old one with more voice reception and a listening headset for a Google-enabled interface that helps you perform certain tasks on each small local network.
The device launched in Australia on November 5 at a price of $399 or Wi-Fi point and Wi-Fi point at $549 AUD.
This female-designed 'Google Home Mini' also received a new upgrade, based on the new $79 price tag. The new 'Nest Mini' improves sound quality with improved bass sound and a wallpaper.
Also planned is the introduction of all new Google smartphones a system that can respond and make calls such as phone calls between home and device at home including Mini Nest calls from outside the home using the Google home app.

The Great Market of China is increasingly attracting international attention.
Roy, research and development manager of New Zealand-based dairy company Theland, said, "Despite the challenges, we will definitely be going to Shanghai to attend the CIIE, the third Chinese import trade fair".
It is time to express the views of overseas traders who have come to China to attend the CIIE, as they face the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
This afternoon, the third CIIE event was launched according to the planned schedule, this major economic and business event is the first of its kind to be organized in China, following the Chinese International Services Exchange held last September.
Apart from being a global event, it also highlighted China's achievements in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic, it also stimulated the global economic recovery.
Over the past three years, this highly-regarded international cooperation platform has made significant progress.
For example, the exhibition centre area has been increased by nearly 30,000 square meters, and the exhibition spaces of the world's 500 largest companies have also increased by 14 percent, of which more than ten companies attended the fair for the first time.
It has been noted that health-care exhibitions and recreational facilities are more popular, especially those dedicated to the prevention of epidemics.
In the same hour, for the first time, the products will be sold live via video, where the most popular online stars will be invited to advertise, so that consumers can buy international products of high quality via video as they wish.
Indeed, the CIIE festival in China has attracted international business attention for the past three years.
The world's 500 largest companies attended the festival with 70 percent participation, which is why they made a significant profit at the festival, and even expect to enter the mainland Chinese market this year, which is in a very special situation.
Moreover, the reason the festival has become increasingly popular among international traders is the Chinese efforts to open its doors to foreigners.
Since the beginning of this year, the Chinese government has issued a series of new policies, aimed at improving the business environment.
China's largest market, with a population of 1.4 billion, is now attracting international leaders through the CIIE Forum, where it is expected to stimulate the global economic recovery.
Governments Should Increase the Reading of Tsangaya - Hon. Kakale.
Nigerian governments have been urged to provide a comprehensive system of improving internship education so that students can gain access to quality education and careers while avoiding the threat of being bullied by canteens.
The request came from Dr Balarabe Shehu kakale a federal MP representing the constituencies of Bodinga, Shuni and Tureta from Sokoto state in northwestern Nigeria, during his speech on Voice of Nigeria.
Dr. kakale said it was wrong that some governments had sent some students back to their home countries due to the fear of the spread of COVID-19, as doing so violated their human rights.
Religious, medical, or official travel is not a good idea during an epidemic, as that would also increase the spread of the disease.
It was very disappointing how the students were kept in trailers and in traffic", says Dr. Balarabe Shehu Kakale.
He said governors should follow the example of other governors who said they would take care of their own affairs because they are free as Nigerians, so every effort should be made to improve their lives.
Finally, he urged Nigerian governors to introduce a high-quality intermittent curriculum so that students would no longer face threats to the tanks.
It also called for the federal government to allocate some of the budget to promote interdisciplinary education as it does for education in the field of education.

A small group of supporters of President Trump gathered outside polling stations in Michigan and Arizona.
Protesters also marched in Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle, Houston, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis, and San Diego.

Since the reign of the incumbent President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, Washington has imposed sanctions on Sudan for its accusations of supporting insurgent groups and the Darfur province's civil war.
The ceasefire in the war-torn eastern Ukraine will take effect at midnight.
KYIV, Ukraine - The Ukrainian and rebel forces in eastern Ukraine have begun preparations for a "complete" ceasefire agreement that is set to take effect at midnight, an effort that officials hope will lead to further steps to bring about peace in their six-year-old conflict.
The rebel leaders said on Sunday they had ordered their troops to prepare a ceasefire and had passed a ban on the use of weapons
The Ukrainian Army said that its forces had begun preparations for the attack with a firing squad.
If you do so, it would "open the way to implement some of the provisions" of the Minsk agreement, the Ukrainian president's office said earlier this week.
The 2015 Franco-German Intervention Agreement provides for a settlement of the conflict between Ukraine and the Russian-backed Ukraine, the crisis that broke out in 2014 after Russia invaded Crimea and the backing of the rebels.
The violence alone has resulted in the deaths of more than 14,000 people.
The leaders of Russia and Ukraine both welcomed the agreement reached on a telephone interview with them on Sunday, which highlighted the importance of the implementation and agreement reached in December at a summit in Paris.
Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed concern over Kyiv's calls for a review of the Minsk agreements, and said that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy "as an irrevocable opponent of the Minsk agreements, he has repeatedly called for them to be re-examined", the Kremlin Palace announced.
For his part, Zelenskiy stressed the need for "a physical reconquest that would lead to the release of Ukrainians held by the rebels in eastern Ukraine, in the Russian-occupied Crimea and in the Russian Federation, according to a press release from his office.
Under the 2015 agreement, Ukraine was expected to retain its power on its borders with Russia in areas occupied by minorities only after granting them autonomy and holding local elections.
The agreement helped to reduce the number of fighting, but Ukrainian and rebel forces continued to exchange fire with larger ones - large artillery guns and small arms.
In December, the leaders of the Kurine, Russia, France and Germany met in Persian capital for another round of talks, expressing their support for the Minsk Accords and agreeing to the restoration of the peace accords.
Zelenskiy, who won the 2019 election on his promise to end the Ukrainian crisis and to regain control of its borders before the start of the domestic elections, but expanded the Kremlin insisted that the deal be done without reviewing it.
A new ceasefire agreement was reached on Wednesday with a tripartite advisory group comprising representatives of Russia and Ukraine and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and has been approved by officials of the European Union.
In a regular Sunday prayer at the St. Peters Forum, Pope Francis praised the agreement you signed, praying for God's blessings to work on it "to rebuild confidence and lay the foundation for providing the necessary resources, for reconciliation and for seeking a waiting session".
Heart disease: Eating chocolate once a week may reduce the risk of falling into this dangerous situation
A recent study has shown that taking this dabia can be beneficial for the heart muscle.
What is it, and how can it reduce the risk of heart disease?
Researchers have conducted a series of studies and studies over more than five years looking at cardiovascular disease (CHD).
CHD - also known as ischemic heart disease - has three main symptoms: chest pain (angina), heart attack, and heart failure.
Other symptoms may include heart attack and shortness of breath.
"Coccolate contains heart-healthy chemicals such as flavonoids, methylxanthines, polyphenols and stearic acid that can reduce inflammation and increase the potency of cystaroles".
Good cholesterol, also known as high-density lipoprotein (HDL), collects the bad cholesterol - the type that opens the heart's veins - and transports it to the liver.
In the liver, "bad" (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol melts and then leaves the body as a contaminant.
However, the new study did not examine the size, type, or variety of chocolates that should be enjoyed.
It was unclear whether the subjects ate dark chocolate, milk chocolate, or cocoa butter.
The results of the study were based on previous studies that confirmed that drinking cocoa (which is found in chocolate) reduced the risk of heart disease.
Scientists believe that the flavonoids found in chocolate lower blood pressure and improve blood vessel function.
The function of the blood vessels refers to the way blood carries oxygen and nutrients through the body and how it removes useless substances from the body.
According to a new study, it is unclear whether or not life's adventures were prioritized in the results.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein comments on the findings, pointing out that those who accept chocolate can become "heavy-weight".
She added that they can "be regularly engaged" in physical activity and be "free from anxiety".
She adds: "Anything can have a negative impact on the health of the coronary arteries".
Alhazan Authority of Nigeria to Begin Receiving Fund for the Bad Hajj.
The chairman of the Zikirullahi Commission Olakunle Hassan made the announcement at a press conference in Abuja.
The representative of the Hausa Department Medina David attended the meeting, and sent us that the Chairman of Alhazai Board Barista Zikirullah Olakunle Hassan said the board will start receiving the Maniyyata Fund for the Hajj 2021 project from September 9.
Ahaji Hassan added that the agency will open a new website to facilitate the registration of the sperm.
In an effort to clarify whether the funds of the pilgrimage would be collected by the beneficiaries who did not receive the pilgrimage, the Chairman of the Alhazan Commission advised the pilgrimage beneficiaries to start saving their funds now to make a contribution to the commission's accounts.
Another factor that has caught the attention of the media is how the coronavirus has caused Saudi Arabia to cancel this year's pilgrimage, and then to increase the tax revenue in Saudi Arabia, will this increase affect the amount Alhazai will pay?
Commissioner of the Alhazan Authority Nura Ahmed Yakasai said the only thing that is certain is that Saudi Arabia has only made a tax increase, after which things like campers and transportation vehicles have not been confirmed as these are changing every year.
The aim of the agency is to facilitate the participation of all Maniyan from Nigeria in the Hajj.
The only question now is whether the vaccine for coronavirus will be successful so that the sperm can perform the hajj.
"I don't want to be like McGregor and pretend to be rich
I'm here to help people', according to Chimaev after setting the record for the UFC boxing event at Fight Island
Khamzat Chimaev is being hailed as the next UFC boxing star after setting a record on Fight Island but the son of a daben and a Rashaya native has no plans to show corruption and spread wealth like Conor McGrgor
Chimaev beat South Irish Rhys Mckee in a middle-class match in Abu Dhabi on Saturday night, where he knocked out his opponent and slapped him with a 3-minute, 5-second slap in the first round of the match.
It was a victory that included Chimaev in the UFC boxing history and no other winner in the shortest time of boxing in this era of mixed martial arts, which comes only 10 days after he defeated John Phillips, a British fighter by a similar disproportionate score - and in a similar middle class.
Boxer Chimaev who had withdrawn $50,000 in his pocket as a bonus for his boxing career with McKee which also attracted the attention of the World MMA boxing team, pointing out that he would be the next 'Khabib 2.0' fighter - a must-see comparison to Chimaev's showing such dominance of the UFC lightweight division.
Despite this new glory and wealth, the controversial speaker Chimaev said he would not be as proud of his wealth as the MMA heavyweight champion Connor Mcgregor or the boxing boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr.
"I did this not just for myself but for everyone else I could help".
I did not want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, who were too busy with money and money.
I wanted to help people, said Chimaev when asked on Fight Island how he would spend the money he had received.
Another man who caught his attention was Conor Mc Gregor's boxer and Twitter social media star Dllon Danis, who went on the platform claiming he could easily copy Chimaev
That was the response of a boxer who was nicknamed "Borz' or "wolf" in his Chechen language - who said that he "blinded my master with blood"
Chimaev, now a professional boxer outside Stockholm, Sweden, left the country at age 19, and was a moderate financial man, but he had little choice in boxing.
"I can destroy anyone...
how many boxers are in the middle class?
I just had to tear them apart", he says.
"I can do a 100-pound champion (about my average weight), a 64-pound champion (average weight) and I can do them all in one day"

Prince Harry's Tale: A friend of the Duke's responds bitterly to some of the most controversial claims about the king in a new book
Mr Stott told Sky TV's news programme that the content of the book about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was no different from what was in the tabloid news.
The veteran urged that the couple's efforts be focused on their charitable activities, including their humanitarian work.
"I think what we read here is no different than what we read in the newspaper pages of proverbs and just return it to a book", Mr. Stott added.
"There is a writer's opinion of the person here, this writing is not proof of their origin"
"I think this is just another attack as other tabloids try to judge them".
"I realize that people are now self-centered and want to hear what they do, but I wish they were focused on their kindness and humanitarian work, rather than on their own personal lives"
"but just because they are in this position they will not escape surveillance".

She added: "The truth is that whatever they did to support the monarchy was a matter of concern to the other members of the royal family, and that was considered a problem".
"They have such a great reputation".
"They celebrated a secret wedding without any failings other than the other members of the royal family of the same rank, Andrew had a smooth ceremony, Anne had a brief celebration at her wedding".
"They were a little bit of a celebration but still the way Harray and Meghan were celebrating was not as good as the rest of William and Kate, but because they captured the world's attention he got the same celebration as the rest of them got".

Grammer, 36, told US WEEKLY that she and her exorcist "did everything anyone should have done to find themselves in this situation" and were "trying to prevent the virus from spreading" and were arrested.
Grammer and her 32-year-old daughter were eating at a table outside a Black Ant restaurant in Manhattan's eastern suburbs at about 11:30 p.m.
It was Friday, just as the restaurant was about to close, when a man came as a policeman demanded food.

INEC will start Voter Registration in 2021.
The Independent Electoral Commission of Nigeria (INEC) said it would begin the registration process in the first three months of next year.
The chairman of the National Commission, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, testified in his press conference shortly after he appeared before the Senate committee on INEC to protect the Commission's 2021 budget.
He said they will spend a long time running the electoral register where registration will be stopped six months before the 2023 general election.
"Our committee intends to resume the registration process in the first three months of 2021", he said.
Once we get back to work, it will continue for a year and a half, in short, almost six months before the 2023 general election.
He said that if they returned to work, they would not be working weekly or monthly, that the work would be done on a regular basis, but that they would be following the work and collecting things, not rushing.
The chairman of the board said that INEC is currently facing 1,700 pre- and post-election court challenges.
He said that the prosecutors offered to win money but still tried to follow the legal measures for any prosecution.
"Everyone who goes to court including INEC, we have about 1700 pre- and post-election pledges, we continue to use the little money we have", he said.
While defending the Commission's budget before the Parliament, Jacob told the Parliamentarians that the Commission plans to issue N5.2 billion from the INEC account for 10 billion for the 2020 budget.
He said that the $10 billion they were talking about was part of the agency's savings since its inception in 2010.
He said that the need for this was to take into account the shortfall in the 2020 budget and the difficulties they faced including the one that the coronavirus pandemic caused the agency to not receive the full budget for 2020 as planned.
As for Nigerians living abroad, he said there was a law that stipulated how they would also vote during the election campaign, saying that once the law came into force they would only be able to vote from their country of residence.
House of Representatives daughter Val Demings speaks on the nomination of my deputy leader, and she defeats Trunp on the issue of forgiveness of criminals
House of Representatives daughter Val Demings (Florida County) has not given up on her determination to run for Vice President under Joe Biden, and she has stood firm in her bid.
In an interview with BlackPressUSA in a campaign titled #FYIYAH! In a series of self-published posts, the prominent member of Congress and member of the Black Congress, described her life history and her self-sacrificing efforts that led her to this position, saying "you all know my history".
Demings was one of seven members of the Senate committee in January on the impeachment of Donald Trump.
Despite being impeached by the Senate, history will never forget that the president of the United States is the fourth on the list of those who were tried for assassination.
The former chairman of the presidential advisory committee, in an interview with NPR in her Capitol Hill office in February, said, "Is the effort worth the soap?"
In addition, although the outcome was not as expected, the Democrats had the right to pursue the issue regardless of the outcome.
During her interview, Demings made it clear that she did not support President Trump's move to reverse Roger Stone's conviction of lying to the Senate (in one of his other false testimony) and to forgive the other co-defendants, and went on to say, "this cruel and reckless act of forgiving your friends, who lied and testified to lie just to cover up your crime".
Demings tops the list of those Biden considers his running mate, the others being CBC chairman Kren Bass (California District), former Congressman representing Geogia, Stacey Admas, Senator Kamarla Harris (California District) and Tammya Duckworth (Illinois District), Atlanta MayorKeisha Lance Bottms, former US Ambassador Susan Rice and others.
She finally said that only one person would decide who would support Joe Biden in this election.
And this guy is Joe Biden.
Sannna, laughing and reaching her hand to her mouth in a humorous way, looks at the maus staring at the conversation, saying "if you think you're going to call him for a kiss... do it"
Undoubtedly, no matter where one may be politically inclined, history will remember this time as a turning point in American politics and a clearer picture of the future.
The effect on Demnings is evident.
She said that having more women run for vice presidential nomination was a sign that it was a rising opportunity to get through the remaining immigration - especially on the issue of African-American women.
"These are the opportunities I have been attacking for a long time in my life, i.e. to provide an opportunity for young men and women who have long been told that you are not the kind of race that is needed, or that you have no money, or that you are not the kind of race that is desired", she says.
The congresswoman promised that she would ensure that the Democratic National Committee and the Biden campaign committee would support and agree to work with the American Black Press Association to get more people out to vote.
"I'll call [the president of the university board] Tom Perez and not take that seriously", Demings promised.
She also agreed that this was something that should be done now, rather than being left until sometime in the middle of the campaign.
In her greeting to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a statement that Trump might refuse to leave the White House if he loses the election, and in a commentary that the newspaper did not say the President had a strategy for forgiving himself, Demings angrily said that "we even thought he would forgive himself, which made me hate him so much".
"But who else would have thought of doing that, besides Trump?
I thought he was doing the job as if he was forced.
Because this is not a job to be forced to break the law and to break the constitution.
I think he has to do this job, but he doesn't want to lose the election.
Of all the signs this president of mine doesn't want to leave the White House, but we know how to deal with it, I'm not even going to be known among the few guards who will do that"
The International Court of Justice has launched an investigation into EndSARS.
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has launched an initial investigation into the ongoing protests against the #EndSARS police force across Nigeria.
The ICC Prosecutor's Office testified in a statement that it had obtained information on alleged crimes committed during the protests that turned into conflict and the smuggling of public and public property.
Protesters have spent weeks in the streets of cities across the country protesting alleged abuse of police officers.
At least 51 civilians, 11 police officers and seven soldiers were killed, according to Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari when he presented the case to the world.
Amnesty International said security forces opened fire on protesters, killing and wounding several others.
Police and military have both denied Amnesty's allegations, but the ICC has said it will release the results of its initial investigation to the public.
The EndSARS campaign, which began in Lagos and Abuja, spread to other states of the country, before later escalating into violence, resulting in loss of lives and property.
Some villagers who were alleged to have hidden and protested destroyed government and other political buildings, especially in the southwestern state of Lagos.
Authorities dispatched police officers to quell the riots, but violence continued to rise as a result of the killing of protesters in Lekki.
The protesters accused security forces of opening fire at Lekki, Lagos state, the centre of the protests, which attracted the bodies of several people.
Some say the opening of the fireworks has contributed to the escalation of the situation, especially in Lagos state.
What a relief!

Rooney who is married to former star star star Wayne Rooney - She is represented in court by lawyer Paul Lunt, from the Liverpool-based law firm Brabners.
Vardy was dating Kingsley Napley of the Worshipful Company of London, but it is still unclear whether she hired a lawyer.
Rooney's tour spokesman declined to comment.

Barrister Mazi Afam Osigwe, one of Maina's defense lawyers, told VOA by telephone that his bail conditions were not met until Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume representing the Maina region came to stand before him and his bail was handed over on Friday 24 July.
The husband added that he is not released until certain documents are completed in accordance with certain procedures and rules of employment and then he is released, you are the representative now living in his family.
He then said the case would be continued if the court returned to the holiday in September.
On 25 October 2019, the EFCC indicted Abdulrashid Maina along with his son Faisal and a company called Common Input Property and Investment Ltd in the Abuja High Court under Judge Okon Abang on charges of bribery, corruption and embezzlement of over Naira billions.
The local people are building themselves a bottle of about N5m in Kano.
The community of some neighbourhoods in Kano have joined forces to rebuild the pot that connected their neighborhoods.
The districts included Darma and Dukawa and Zangon and part of Sharifai district.
On a visit to the neighborhood by Freedom Radio, she found out how far the work had come.
Prof Mubarak Abba, one of the youngest neighbourhood leaders, said they no longer wait for the government to make such applications.
How much would it cost to complete the work?
Mubarak said they have carried out several neighborhood development projects but this is the biggest they do.
The project is expected to generate about five million dollars.
How the work is financed The local people collect money among themselves where each person pays what God has ordained for the work.
According to Muhsin Aminu Dukawa who collects the project's funds.
Mothers also contributed.
Mothers too were not left behind in their contribution.
Hajiya Fadima Danbalarabe, also known as Niniya, was one of the local mothers.
She said that they gave food to the workers and soaps and whatever else God had commanded them.
How did the large neighborhoods respond?
The young men who led the project said that the project was not possible without the contributions of the neighbors and the local elder.
Alhaji Lamin Isah, one of the local elders, said the club had been a long-standing challenge to them, but now their children have finally solved the problem.
Since the neighborhood was so crowded with religious activities, the youths were placed at the forefront of the local clergy.
Gwani Hadi Sadisu Zangon Bare-bari is a distinguished Quranic teacher here in Kano who is involved in this project.
He said that he was very happy that the young people in the neighborhood asked him to be their advisor on the project.
How does the community view the work?
Nationalistic thinkers have argued that this is what a nation should do to promote its own territory.
Alhaji Abubakar Ibrahim, also known as the Government of God Power, was one of the nationalists in Kano.
We urge other youths to imitate these neighborhoods because if they wait for the government to fix it, it will soon be over.
Critics of everyday affairs have long challenged the government on how nearly every neighborhood is facing such problems, and the government's failure to reach out to the community has begun to take such a self-repair step.
Life is still difficult in Nigeria.
The federal government of Nigeria and the states have now claimed to spend tens of millions of Naira to support the underserved, to alleviate the hardships of living caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, also known as coronavirus.
Ahmad Tukur Jada, one of the leaders of small farmers' organizations in Nigeria, explained to the Hausa department the challenges facing the poor during this pandemic, which included the cost of living.
Regarding the issue of corona support, he said they saw nothing.
But as the poor struggled, some representatives and organizations began to seek ways to alleviate the suffering of the society.
Taraba state legislator Bashir Muhammad Bape told Voice of America that in his Nguroje constituency, they bought 60 motorcycles and branded machines and sewing bicycles distributed to the community to provide a way of life.
So far, some markets have been opened in Taraba state but there is a struggle over how some infrastructure like Hatsi and small steel mills are in dire need of increasing demand.
I Cope With Challenges Before I Was Succeeded by Zakulo Zulum - Shetty.
Former Borno State Governor and Senator representing Central Borno in the Nigerian Senate, Alhaji Kashim Shettima, detailed the challenges he faced before reaching the position of winning Governor of Borno State, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum, as his successor in the seat left by the governor in the 2019 election.
Shettima announced this during his presentation of an article at a conference organized by the Coalition of Youth Groups in Kebbi, the capital of Kebbi State, entitled "Youth and Parenthood: Improvements from the Great North".
"Governor Babagana Zulum is a more committed man than I am, and his election as successor is not a matter of personal preference, but of opinion of the entire Borno State community", he said.
The former governor also advised the leaders in Nigeria to remember that rule is a trust entrusted to man by God the King, adding, "and consider it a time, and on the day of judgment you will be held accountable for everything you have done during that time".
As a leader, we must be careful that it is a role model, that we teach the developing world about a future, for we cannot be sure forever.
Even today, Senator Shettima has been showered with outrage over how some of the most powerful people are using their power, and said that it may have something to do with the government's alcoholism.
On the one hand, he expressed deep concern about the way in which some youths are living in the rush to pursue an education or a career that is self-reliant.
He pointed out that young people need to be upright in pursuit of education, which would give them the full opportunity to lead the country to the mountains of safety.
Similarly, Shettima needs to improve domestic methods to boost economic development and reduce unemployment problems across the country.

Chelsea manager Frank Lampard praised striker Pedro Rodriguez after his last league game for the club on Sunday.
The 32-year-old signed a short-term contract that would see him transferred to AS Roma on a free transfer as soon as they finished with the defender
The Spaniard, who arrived from Barcelona in 2015, briefly played under Lampard this season with eight first-class appearances and 21 one-day internationals.
The head of the home team confirmed Pedro's departure after the West London side reached the fourth tier below after beating Wolves 2 on a try, which eventually led the former player to rise from the bench to score his final goal.
"Pedro played his last club match with her", Lampard told Sky Sports television.
"His teammates praised him as a priestess in the changing room and that was justified by the kind of talent he had earned in his professional career and in his club.
'This was his last match in the first round, but the impact and contribution he made was remarkable.
I extend my thanks to the Peds and wish him well in the organization he has returned to.
"It's to finish the rest of the season, but every time a great player leaves the team my situation changes with his other players as I've been noticed".
In a farewell message Pedro posted on his Twitter account, the player exclaimed: "I killed the Stanford Bridge"
I am grateful to all my fans and all the support you have given me over the years, and to the Club I am grateful for the opportunity to be a blue flag for my friends and
I will always remember you in my heart.
So we are determined to fight for the FA Cup!!
MY blood for my brothers and sisters"
The former Barcelona striker left Chelsea after helping the club since 2017 under Antonio Conte and also won the FA Cup in 2018, and the Europa League a year later under Maurizio Sarri.
A fisherman was seen "throwing an elephant and a bottle of wine" in Devon
A boxer threw a water animal and a bottle of wine when the animal broke his net, according to a charity.
Some pictures taken at Hope Nose, near Torquay, show a man throwing a stone at a watermelon with something from the mouth of a moon.
Duncan Kenny, who took the photographs, said the fisherman threw his drink into a bottle before throwing the fish back where he had previously found it.
Mr. Kenny called the incident "a "disorderly and unreasonable act".
The man claimed to be collecting garbage in a Devon park with a group of volunteer waterlife volunteers when he saw the man attack on Sunday morning.
"The water was trying to reach the man's drop", says the man.
"A fisherman who has a whip in his mouth throws the fish out of the water.
"The eagle found the creature behind him, and he was able to walk on the water".
Mr. Kenny said that "the water animal is simply a body, but the animal is doing what it is naturally doing".
"The bottle-bound jacket prevents her from hunting", the man said.
The aquarium industry has said that "this is not new" to reports of such cruelty in the past".
In a post on her Facebook page, she said that volunteers collected trash with 12 bodies during the visit to Hope's Nose and noted "examples of bad behavior".
All aquatic animals are protected by the law of conservation and protection of aquatic animals, and people are advised to avoid these animals.
Opposition Parties in Niger Published a Book on the Errors of the Electoral System.
Opposition parties in the Republic of Niger have launched a booklet detailing the errors they have identified in the general election plans that are expected to be held in the country, starting at the end of 2020 as the election commission leaders call on political parties to disagree to ensure everything goes smoothly.
The interest of the local and foreign public in the current state of the Nigerian election process was the main goal of writing this book called "Livre Blanc" which in part served as a way of raising awareness among supporters of the opposition parties, as their cousin Maman Sani Adamou told the voice of voice of the United States shortly after the launch of the 40-page book.
Implementing changes to the electoral commission and electoral registers is one of the demands that "the opposition continues to exert pressure on them, according to a close associate in the Moden Lumana party, Lawali Salissou Leger, the importance of these demands has reached the position of stopping the reform of the movement.
The opposition movement seems to have started to influence their supporters according to Ramatou Alele, one of the activists of the MPN National Party.
Plans for the next municipal election, which will begin in December, are now likely to be delayed, as data suggests that Nigerian authorities have begun attempts to give the OIF the task of filing the country's electoral rolls, as a step to clear the ballot box.

Donald Trump has expressed regret at times for posting tweets on his Twitter account
Donald Trump has expressed regret at times for the way he has been making the most of his social media posts on Twitter.
The president of the United States said this during a speech at a Bartool Games event on Friday, the President said his messages of impunity - which included a strong support for white supremacists - had thrown him into a more difficult situation.
When asked by journalist Dave Portnoy if he regretted such comments on his website, Trump replied: "Sometimes, sometimes, repeatedly.
In a way, you can write a letter after study and then feel that it is a very large letter.
And then, after leaving it on your desk, you go back to the city and say, "You know the truth that God has not sent me to tell you".
But now that is not possible with the Virgin, is it?
We immediately open it, feeling that we have done something right, and then you start to hear calls to ask - "Did you say that?"
I would say, "What if I am?" and then other things would come up".
Last month, after Trump pulled out a rescue after posting another tweet on his Twitter account, he showed me a video of his supporters in a Florida village with an elderly couple cheering for me with the cry "God bless the white man!"
Similarly, in 2017, Trump posted on his Twitter account a three-part anti-Muslim message from Jayda Fransen, leader of Britain's far-right fringe party.
The boss told Portnoy that these messages she re-posted on his site had more to do with him getting into trouble
"When you see something that's interesting and you don't research it, you don't know the purpose of it, or the city's agenda, you go to the mall and you go to the mall and you go to the mall", Trump said. "I find that almost every time I re-send messages from other places, I get more and more conflicted".
The president sometimes spread self-congratulatory messages, lashed out at opponents and insulted the school to more than 80 million followers.
Trump claims Twitter helped him address what he called "fake news" reports on television and newspapers that he said were full of fake news.
The President's comments were often in their own analysis, and the Twitter platform above helped to make the president naked in his comments.

The unwholesome behavior of the United States is a major threat to international peace and security.
Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodrigurz, has made several appearances at high-level meetings held to mark the 75th anniversary of the UN's founding in September.

The first is interference in foreign affairs and a threat to international political security.
Second, the imposition of sanctions without any reason is a threat to global economic security.
The third race to acquire weapons is also a threat to the security of the world's military.
Fourth, halt efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, and threaten the global environment.
Fifth, my sister's beliefs about the environment and the threat to the environment.
Sixth, cyberattacks, and the threat to the security of international data.
And then the seventh and final, international cooperation in the fight against COVID-19 corruption and threatens the global health system.
In today's world, peace, prosperity, and mutual cooperation are the only ways to prosper.
Any selfish, violent, rebellious, oppressive, and cooperative ideas that would undermine international cooperation and promote global security would never have a basis and would be condemned by history.
