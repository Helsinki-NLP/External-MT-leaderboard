This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widespread theory, but it allows for details that fossils usually don't give, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the upper feathers of this animal were a brownish-brown color, and the underparts were pale or carotenoid.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed plumage called a rachis, but have other features of feathers  in order I and II experiments  researchers concluded that the plumage probably arose later in evolution than these other features.
The researchers say that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the pattern shows the feathers of adult specimens, not the feathers of juveniles.
Research has shown that, although it is a tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen is part of the feathers of the adult bird, not the chicken's feathers.
A car bomb exploded outside the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was meant to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was seeking is caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon pulls the earth and causes tides, so the Milky Way pulls the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have shown that dark matter interacts with dark matter just as dark matter interacts with ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around galaxies forms a sort of halo around the galaxy that consists of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been low-tech: Voters are isolated in booths, where a pre-printed sheet of paper with the name of the chosen candidate is put in an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The procedure is very strictly regulated by French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers could attest that no envelopes were in them at the start of voting and that no envelopes were added to them except those inserted by duly counted and authorised voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the proceedings, and in the evenings, volunteers can be assigned to strictly monitor the votes by following certain procedures.

She's in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, but there's a possibility that the eyewitness evidence will be derivative because many media outlets have published her photograph.
This is a well-established practice throughout the United Kingdom, but the courts in Scotland operate differently and the courts have considered the publication of the photographs potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be dancing on a dangerous wire with the publication of photos of suspects and so on".
The Crown Office, which handles all criminal cases, has told reporters it will not comment further until at least the indictment is filed.
The document, according to leaked information, will address the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics reportedly discussed included the future State of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a continuous military presence for ten years after the signing of the treaty, and the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence for only five years.
The hunters in the trial hunt to suppress the predators would be under the strict supervision of park rangers who would monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the hunt.
Qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association hunting programme, as part of the partnership between the NPWS and the Australian hunting association Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and park heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected to carry out the first firing operation received extensive safety briefings and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday as a member of the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelli's fifth interim board in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission cited the earlier resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests have been triggered by the absence of elections that had been due to take place since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating causing six fires, with four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving devices.
"Last week, the Department of Commerce and Industry stated that Apple had notified it of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company deemed "not serious".
"The ministry called Apple's delay in the report "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management in the Northern Mariana Islands says there's been no damage reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired shots at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
So far, several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early along with the Filipino photographer.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that when the hormone was administered, it accelerated the maturation of the fetal lung.
Xinhua news agency reported that government investigators on Wednesday found two recorders of flight data from the "black box".
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first queen of extreme. my first manager. Luna passed away in the night two months ago. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman.'"
"Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnells stated ""Luna was as strange as I am, if not more... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she's gone to a better place"."""
From the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of the respondents share the same view and believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last Australian monarch.
Twenty-nine percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was set to swim in the 100 and 200-meter freestyle and the triple-division relay at the Commonwealth Games, but complaints have raised questions about his health.
He couldn't take pain medication because it's banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known up to January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and it was published on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of the water on Earth, along with the organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists are interested in how planets form, especially the Earth, which was formed by comet collisions long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year, and the governor signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
"He called the rumors 'political gossip and nonsense.'"
He's supposed to run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that the NextGen system would reduce airline routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel a year and reducing carbon emissions.
Unlike older radar-based technology, this system uses satellite technology to help air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and to give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transportation options will be organised and no above ground trains will stop at Wembley, nor will parking facilities and ground level parking and public transport use be available.
Due to fears of a lack of transportation, the possibility arose that the game would have to be moved indoors without fans.
Research published Thursday in the journal Science reported the development of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that new species have evolved within just two generations, although this process was thought to take much longer, due to crossbreeding between the endemic Darwin's frog, Geospiza fortes, and the newcomer of the genus Geospiza contris.
Gold can be shaped into all sorts of shapes, it can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be inserted into a thin wire, which can be wound and unwound, or it can be hammered in, or it can be rolled into a plane.
"It can be very thin and stick to other metal. It can be so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "painted manuscripts".
It's called chemical pH, and you can get a reading of it from the juice of the red cabbage.
The salt changes color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH value is denoted by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in the abbreviation pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons without electrons (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders together, then clean them with wet fists and squeeze into the ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, and the reaction will tickle you and cause a crust to form.
In Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, each house was equipped with at least one flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewerage systems have been found in the construction sites of the ancient Greek mining towns of Crete and Santorini.
Baths were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and during Roman civilization, they were sometimes part of public baths, where both men and women mingled in the community.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call, then almost immediately reflects it back down.
A satellite is launched into space by a rocket, and scientists in space use a telescope because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and views.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space requires a giant rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel brought unimaginable changes to the world, and the biggest change was that the invention of the wheel made transportation much easier and faster.
It made possible the invention of the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are the medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, many small cats (including domestic cats) eat much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, which is the special position that each cat takes, so that it doesn't have to compete with the others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called herds.
Lion herds consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually closely related and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave much like wolf packs or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump a long distance, and pull with five times the strength of a man.
The tiger is in the same group as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, and these four are the only cats that can hoot.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's roar, but more like a series of unintelligible, spoken words.
Ocelots eat small animals, and they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that octopuses track and locate prey by smell, sniffing the ground where prey moves.
They have excellent night vision and move very inconspicuously, so the birds hunt for prey by blending into the surroundings and then jumping on the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (for example, during a mountain or river crossing or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often be found in a different environment.
A new environment means different resources and different competition, so a new population needs characteristics or adaptations that are different from those of the previous population in order to compete for resources.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still have to make the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
In time, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will differ so much in appearance that they cannot be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and then take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants create food from sunlight through photosynthesis.
We make our homes and our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the dominant predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long forehead had over 70 sharp teeth along with an extra set of teeth on its neck which meant it was of no help to anyone who got in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that it had a protruding tongue, and it fed on turtles, big fish, and other mosasaurs, and maybe even a cannibal.
It would attack anything that entered the water; even giant dinosaurs like T. rex would not be able to stand up to it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had a number of unusual or unusual delicacies that included wild boars, peacocks, snails and puffins.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate seated on benches, while the rich men enjoyed communal feasts at which they would feast on their sides.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained the ingredients that would come to Europe from America or Asia over the following centuries.
For example, they had never known corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no one in ancient Rome had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs by means of elaborate ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramids were shaped into towers, called ziggurats, that were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary of the gods.
In the warm climatic conditions of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most Hebrew family life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were open to the road; stone was used to build houses.
The land of Canaan lacked large forests, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and Norse sagas tell us that Erik the Red, after being banished from Iceland for murder, discovered Greenland on his way west and gave it that name.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes had already settled there.
"Although each country was 'Scandinavian,' there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland".
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence had a treasure map.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence it says, 'Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776.' The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down".
No one knows for sure who wrote this large document on parchment (dimensions 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches), but it is known that soon after it was made it was destroyed for storage.
So, that entry was probably added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and the fighting that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French of "Higher France", who in 1940 made peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched a massive attack in southern France, known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and advanced on Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together  society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, and it refers to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also determines the size of society in some way.
Civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the imprint on culture and the equitable spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and we don't recognize them as true civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, thirteen states by the Articles of Confederation first established a weak central government consisting of only the Congress.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and since there was no state or judicial authority, it relied on competent authorities, who often did not cooperate, to enforce all its acts.
Nor did he have the authority to override tax laws and customs duties between states.
The treaty needed to be amended by the unanimous consent of all the states, and the states did not take the central government seriously, so their representatives were mostly absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with Germany, the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, field hockey and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
"Because it is made up of a cluster of islands, Japan is often called an 'archipelago' from a geographical point of view".
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing near the island recorded the name as Ilha Formosa, "the beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southeastern Taiwan and begins the transformation of aboriginal practices in grain production and employs Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar cane plantations.
1683 Qing dynasty (1644 - 1912) forcibly takes control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal area and declares Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled it until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better introduction to how they were originally built.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration is still ongoing.
For example, the most common photo format in the world is 35 mm, which was the main film size before the end of the era of analog film.
It's still being made today, but more importantly, the same proportions are in the image sensor formats in digital cameras.
It's a little confusing to realize that the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The ratio of the width and height of this format (divided by twelve to get the ratio expressed in prime integers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, APS group formats) are equal to or closest to this image width-to-height ratio.
The oft-injured and derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamics while maintaining some order in the picture.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church came under criticism.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has bound together European nations with different languages and customs.
The powerful influence of Christianity affected everyone from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used for the purpose of alleviating suffering and poverty and that the church's financial resources exist specifically for that purpose.
For over a thousand years, the central authority of the church has been in Rome, and this concentration of power and money has caused many to wonder whether they are adhering to this principle.
Shortly after the outbreak of the armed conflict, Great Britain began a naval blockade of N. Germany.
The strategy worked because it prevented German access to vital military and civilian supplies, but the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain had mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire parts of the ocean, which also posed dangers to neutral ships.
Given that there was little interest in this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the pacifist attitude and separation prevailed among most citizens and peoples.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the clerk at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each family in power was a recognizable dynasty.
Each dynasty was followed by a period of unstable divided provinces, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars were fought between the nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history; thousands of people died in the battle for supremacy in the great palace of Xian.
The consequences are social and political, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people, not the ruler.
Besides, after the Revolution, employment was open to all men and the most ambitious and successful were given the chance to succeed.
The same is true of the army, because after the revolution, ranks were awarded on merit, not merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in questions beyond the confines of his dull life. The cave that became known as the "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) he visited so that he could think better".
The cave that has survived through history provides a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual values.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know for sure that it exists.
You can't see anything but the clear, beautiful sky and the many mountains around, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing.
The Pyramid of Cheops, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many great pyramidal structures built in honor of the late pharaoh.
"The Giza Plateau or ""Necropolis of Giza"" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and a multitude of smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Pharaoh Khufu's wives and members of his family.
"The symbol 'upside-down' looks like a V and the symbol 'downside-down' looks like a connector or a square without a bottom".
The up sign means to start from the top and push the pulley, and the down sign means to start from the frog (where we hold the pulley with our hand) and pull the pulley.
A raised cymbal usually produces a softer sound, while a lowered cymbal is louder and more intrusive.
Feel free to add your own labels, but remember that the butt movement labels are omitted for musical reasons, so they should generally be adhered to.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Therese, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the king's sister Elizabeth were forced by a mob of women to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob of people who were shouting and shouting threats at the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At one point, a member of the mob, in front of the terrified queen, shook the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the cost, and the interest on the bonds was exchanged through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos will form the core profit of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars we must understand the context in which the order was created.
The time of these events is commonly called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000  1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from a technological incentive or technological imperative to the strict notion that human destiny is guided by fundamental logic connected to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology has effects on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that the invention of the automobile necessarily led to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network does not pay for just a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership is driving higher rates of road accidents, leading to the discovery of new techniques in health care for treating injuries.
There was a strong element of cultural determinism in Romanticism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and over time, geography-related customs and culture emerge that are consistent with the physical residence of a society, and thus superior to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was known as an epicenter of luxury from 400 B.C.E. to about 1100 C.E.
The status deteriorated in the twelfth century largely due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with silk and spices that were of higher value than what the Byzantine market offered.
At this time, the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The heyday of the Gothic style was in the 10th to 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
The dress was initially heavily influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, slow communication meant that the styles in the West were 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great discoveries of the era, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons on clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is farming to produce sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple and often organic system that uses seeds from an autochthonous ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
In the past, most farmers were self-sufficient, and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that make a subculture special can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often show their membership in a recognizable and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite the unfortunate cases of children who grew up without adult socialization, either as a result of neglect, accident or intentional abuse.
Some wild children are imprisoned by humans (most often their own parents), and in some cases, abandonment is the result of a parent's denial that their child has a severe intellectual or psychological disability.
Wild children can experience severe abuse or trauma before they're abandoned or run away.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
If it is fully trained by animals, the wild child exhibits behaviours (within the physical limits) that are almost completely similar to the behaviours of the animal that trained it, such as fear of humans or indifference to humans.
While learning on a project should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not an educational method but rather a support for individuals facing a new learning experience, e.g. using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scales can be virtual and real; in other words, the teacher is the shape of the scale, as well as the animated joiner that appears in Microsoft Office programs.
The virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software and is designed to interrogate, instruct and explain procedures that may be too challenging for the learner to solve on their own.
Children are placed in the foster care system for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but it is happening.
We believe the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is mandated to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The housing should meet all the needs that are missing in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet open up additional dimensions in terms of use and access.
"For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are cited as important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995)."
"In researching visitor reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified ""personal engagement"" and ""continuous relationships"" as novel motivational aspects".
The use of video recording has made important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to tell whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work The President's Speech, argues that people who cannot understand speech because of brain injury can still accurately assess his sincerity.
He suggested that even animals like domestic dogs have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century revealed two groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection is the removal from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination in each generation shift the variability between these two sources.
In savanna primates with digestive systems similar to human digestive systems, it is difficult to meet the requirement for amino acids from available plant sources.
Failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, poor nutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant resources were the proteins from the leaves and pulp, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest uncooked.
In contrast, animal food ( ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also contains large amounts of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
"All things considered, it should not surprise us that our ancestors handled the 'protein intake' issue in much the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savannah".
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during a normal sleep period and going back to sleep shortly afterwards (10  60 minutes).
This is possible by simply using a relatively quiet stimulant to bring you to consciousness without fully awakening.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythmic options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, which makes you want to get up and pee.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present, and everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of that is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it's expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
The basic principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple, including Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini yoga stimulates the kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) by means of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
Divine yoga is at the heart of Tibetan meditation, through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. After the war, differences in systems, practices and cultures led to hostility between the two countries.
Two years before the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be led by truly empowered armies on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had collapsed, and the only hope was to withdraw and rebuild along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were thwarted almost overnight, when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered Poland and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern Polish regions, thus violating the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Transporting goods by ship is certainly the most efficient way for large numbers of people and large amounts of goods to cross the ocean.
The role of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time preventing the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the Americans tried to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain, as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
The pious goats were usually kept in flocks that roamed the meadows and other pastures, and were guarded by the "kozars", usually children or adolescents, as the shepherds who tended the goats were called.
Tracks for horse-drawn carriages were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the first wooden wagon tracks consisted of only parallel planks, they allowed the horses to pull the wagons at higher speeds and to pull more cargo than would have been possible on the rougher roads of the time.
The railings were put in early enough to keep the tracks in place, but it was gradually realized that the tracks could be more efficient with iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused the wooden wheels to wear out more.
Eventually, iron wheels replaced wood, and the first fully iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, and humans started walking upright two million years ago when Homo erectus appeared.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal gait appears in the australopithecines about 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, and it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more in harmony with the environment, we can join environmental movements and we can even be activists to reduce some of the suffering in the future.
In many cases, it's like symptomatic treatment, but unless we're looking for a solution that's only temporary, we need to find the root of these problems and neutralize them.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems are increasing because of the overcrowded and extravagant way people live.
After Congress approved the manuscript on July 4, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, it was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th, and the other arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 copies of Dunlap that are known to exist are the oldest preserved copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But many of the features of birds resemble those of dinosaurs.
They have shells and claws on their feet, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the handling of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary characters or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently common to be undiagnosed.
Perhaps the best indicator of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Look for the specific first-aid instructions on the sticker that relate to that poison.
The term "bugs" is used by entomologists in the official sense for this group of insects.
This term comes from the well-known bug, an insect that has adapted very well to parasitize humans.
Killer and common caterpillars depend on their hosts, in whose nests or living quarters they live.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged persons.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may conclude that raising a newborn is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
Couples like that can give their child up for adoption.
In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that the other couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works by using the scientific method, and this method is actually the guideline for most scientific research.
In addition to these methods, experimentation, or experiments that represent tests to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, questioning, and observation also guide scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, have been accepted.
As knowledge of the Greeks declined, the West severed ties with Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Numerous recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by the biological clock.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external cyclic stimuli, have been discovered in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to cycle freely even if there are no external cues.
The experiment that Hershey and Chase performed was one of the leading suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments that looked at DNA in phosphorus-based phages or sulfur-based protein phages.
Mutations can have a multitude of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the germline cells are affected.
Only mutations in the germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
For example, visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns and drive to work, while passing those whose workplace is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation scenario, everyone is somehow connected to the transportation system based on private cars and supports it.
Science now says that this massive carbon economy has thrown the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, there are few complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why are transportation systems the cause of so many complaints; why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something much bigger going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic patterns is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a relatively consistent manner, so traffic flows have a certain amount of reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships between three main characteristics are established: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of the road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly allowed them to escape enemies more easily and more efficiently to find food and steam.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards along the body.
This allows them a large number of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold the wings of the fairy are the water horse and the water world.
Several thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought that he was right, but many were convinced of the opposite - that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolves around the earth.
That seems reasonable because we don't have a sense that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, containing more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, some six miles wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's mainstream is 3,980 miles [6,387 km] long, and it is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids were built until the fall of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the size and technical excellence of the pyramids at Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent country and the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most of the workers in the country, while Latin is often used in religious services.
All Vatican citizens are Roman Catholic.
Humans have known since ancient times about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper because they can all be found in nature in their original form and relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of one or a mixture of more than four elements, these being earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four aggregate states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they changed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals, and don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There may also be alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion of them could fit on the dot at the end of this sentence.
The pencil thus became a close companion to a great number of people when it appeared.
Sadly, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pen has lost its status and is used less and less.
People are writing messages on computer screens these days, so they don't need a spike.
We can only guess what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes out.
The physics bomb works by taking energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and by splitting the core, you're releasing some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with or without a gentle push.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It's thinner in the moonlit seas, and thicker in the highlands.
On the near side, there might be more dark areas because the crust is thinner, the lava has been able to reach the surface more easily.
Content theories are focused on discovering what motivates or attracts people.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized with maturation and growth.
These theories consider what it is that makes some people want what they want and what phenomena in the environment make them do or not do something.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors may emerge in the case of managers who start to manage former colleagues: At one end of the spectrum are attempts to remain 'part of the team.'"
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting evaluations, assigning authority, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who thinks he has to change everything the team has done and do it his way.
The team leader is ultimately responsible for its success or failure.
This behavior often creates a gap between the leader and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams should adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are some small differences.
Members of virtual teams often represent a touchpoint to the nearest physical group.
They're often more autonomous than the classic team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which local management may not understand.
"The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".
The 'invisible team' represents the management team to which each member is accountable.
Why would an organisation go through the lengthy process of setting up a learning organisation again?
After the efficient use of all available resources in all functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity come to the fore.
As a result, the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method by which organizations can achieve a higher degree of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and this makes the field of research narrower and more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is confirmed by scientific research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction connotation, it constitutes a very important branch of information science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
The research on artificial intelligence involves the creation of machines for the purpose of automating tasks requiring intelligent behaviour.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, and handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now widely used in economics, medicine, construction, and the military because they are embedded in some software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every class, and often the teacher would be happy to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers a solution to virtual trips, where students can visit museum exhibits, visit aquariums, or admire fine art while sitting in class.
Virtual sharing of trips is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the page changes, but the old versions are kept online as a kind of memorial.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills, and when students start blogging, they often make mistakes in grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience usually corrects them.
Since students are the most critical audience, the blogger begins to seek the advancement of writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them" and the need to stimulate the interest of the audience inspires them to be inventive and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to take learning beyond the traditional school.
"The appropriate use of blogs ""can encourage students to think analytically and critically; by actively responding to online material, students can define their own positions in the context of others' writings and express their own perspective on certain issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming capital and offers a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
A little further south are Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of the Muskoka region and beyond.
All of these things make Ontario feel essentially Canadian to foreigners.
Large areas farther north are very sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and can be considered a continent when it comes to flora and fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or linked to France and are famous luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, which took deep root in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area borders the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that women on the trip say they are married regardless of their actual marital status.
It helps if you wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in what could be considered harassment and it is not uncommon for someone to follow them, grab their hand, etc.
Resolutely reject men and don't be afraid to take a stand for yourself (this is not okay regardless of cultural differences!).
Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. and in the time of the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids, the city was known as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as pekes, pots, leather goods, nargils, and a whole range of trinkets, but that is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Gomu was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets, especially the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside Goma should be explored to understand the nature of the fighting taking place in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also a starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano and some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
To get around Gome, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The normal (local) fare is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
"Timbuktu, because of its relative inaccessibility, is now used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands".
Despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and its airport, Timbuktu is an impoverished city today.
In 1990 it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites because of the threat of sandstorms.
It was one of the main places where Henry Louis Gates stopped during the filming of the PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is the antithesis of other cities in the country because it has more of the Arab world than the African world.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the northeast of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River as its southern boundary.
The park's 19,500-square-kilometre (11,600 sq mi) area is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each of which is home to a different species of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered to be the leading South African National Park (SANParks).
As with other South African national parks, daily conservation fees and admission fees are payable.
One might also benefit from buying a wild card that allows entry into certain parks in South Africa or into all South African national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong, which is a major destination for many tourists.
The display of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline is comparable to a glowing columnar chart, made even more visible by the sea in Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite coast, Kowloon.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is tightly packed on the landward side along the northern coast.
The site was taken over by British colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal belt of mangroves in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast to Bangladesh and the Indian subcontinent.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest located in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps, but they include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges valley.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, approximately one-third of which is covered by wetlands.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 deer living there.
Buses leave from the intercity bus station (across the river) all day, but most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the inter-district buses are often crowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the counties are served by small Japanese Toyota Coaster buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Sharing taxis is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as the towns of Paro (150 Nu.) and Punakha (200 Nu.).
The Oyapock River is crossed by a suspension bridge that links the towns of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 273 feet [83 m], are 1,208 feet [378 m] long, and have two 12-foot-wide [3.50 m] lanes.
The freeway height under the bridge is 15 meters.
The bridge is scheduled to be commissioned in September 2017, when the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints is expected.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous community in what is now eastern Paraguay, semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurúa and the Payaguá, who made their living by hunting, gathering fruits, and fishing.
After the Spanish conquerors encountered the native population in the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of the Indies", was born.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to retain its indigenous character and identity.
The Argentine national team and its players are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo grounds of Las Cañitas
Smaller tournaments and matches are held in other parts of the year.
For news on the tournaments and information on where to buy tickets for the half-time matches check the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands Pound (FKP) which is equal in value to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere in the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also commonly accepted in Stanley.
On remote islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, but British and American currency may be accepted; inquire with the owner beforehand about acceptable payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange the money before you leave the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer when the northern hemisphere is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone; temperatures of +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely go below the ice sheet, but the combination of wind and humidity creates a feeling that it's colder than the thermometer shows.
"There are no particular 'rainy' or 'dry' seasons: the amount of rain is generally the same throughout the year".
Although many of the animals in the park have become accustomed to human visits, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park management guidelines, keep at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from other wildlife!
No matter how obedient they may appear, buffalo, deer, reindeer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get hurt because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
Also, bear in mind that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval battle in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships sank except one British cruiser, and nearly 200 German and American citizens lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence led by the Mau movement, during a peaceful gathering in the city, the assassination of Tupue supreme leader Tamasese Lealofi III occurred.
The two ports of Auckland provide a multitude of beaches, the most popular of which are found in the three areas.
The beaches on the North Shore (in the North Harbour neighborhood) are on the coast of the Pacific Ocean and range from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy, safe for bathing, and many are shaded by Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the port of Waitemata, in the affluent Mission Bay and St. Heliers neighborhoods of central Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes crowded, with a wide array of shops along the shore.
"The main one is the local beer 'Number One.' " The beer is not complex, but pleasant and refreshing.
There are plenty of French wines you have to try, but the wines of New Zealand and Australia might be more to your liking.
The local tap water is safe to drink but if you're a little wary, you'll find bottled water easily.
"The "straight white" coffee is a foreign drink to Australians, the short black coffee is espresso, the cappuccino is full of pepper, and the tea is served without milk".
The hot chocolate is on a Belgian level, the fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many visit the reef year-round, and injuries from any of the above causes are rare.
However, listen to the advice of the authorities, observe all signs and adhere to safety warnings.
Sea otters appear near beaches and river mouths north of the city from October to April, sometimes in other months.
Sharks do exist, but they often attack people, and most sharks are afraid of people, and they'd swim away.
Sea crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean; their main habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodations in advance takes the burden off a traveler's shoulders because they know they'll have a place to sleep when they get to their destination.
Travel agents often have arrangements with specific hotels, although it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation such as camping through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, organized transportation to/from the airport, or even a combination flight and hotel package.
They can also keep your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents needed to arrive at your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should first be made to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of participants camp at the festival site, and most consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be as close to the stage as possible, you'll have to get there early to take your place.
Keep in mind that even if the music on the main stages ends, some parts of the festival will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas designed for families with young children.
If you are travelling in the northern Baltic in winter, be careful when choosing a cabin because the passage through the ice creates a terrible noise that is more audible in certain cabins.
Cruise Saint Petersburg includes time spent in the city.
Casinos usually try to maximize the amount of time and money that their patrons spend, and there are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests happy and in the building.
Some establishments offer free alcohol, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers are aware of the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy roads and snow-covered roads, there is little friction and you cannot drive as if you were on a clear asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a short time to get you stuck.
The visibility may also be limited by snow falling or being carried by wind, condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many countries, but traffic is generally continuous throughout the year.
The safari is probably the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the best experience for many visitors.
The term safari in everyday usage refers to a journey by land with the purpose of visiting the amazing African wildlife, especially in the savannahs.
Certain animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to the car, and good views are possible with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
"A walking safari (also called a 'bushem walk', 'mountain safari' or 'walking safari') consists of a walk lasting from a few hours to a few days".
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo, the host of the 1964 Games, will become the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics.
If you booked a flight and accommodation for the 2020 Games before they were postponed, you could find yourself in an awkward situation.
The rules for cancellations vary, but since the end of March most of the rules for cancellations due to the coronavirus have not been extended until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were due to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing about ¥7,000.
You can dry wet clothes by ironing them, and many hotels will rent you an ironing board and a dry ice machine even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have a rubber, or if you don't like to wear rubber socks, you can also use a hair dryer if you have one handy.
Make sure that the fabric does not overheat (which can lead to shrinkage or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it takes only one minute for the water to boil, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you have doubts, buy bottled water from reputable companies.
Travelers may encounter pests that are not familiar with their region.
Pests can spoil food, cause itching, or in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, transmit poison, or infection.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force are not usually classified as pests.
The Commission therefore considers that the exemption is justified on the basis of the criteria set out in the Guidelines.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can save a considerable amount of money, especially when buying alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most demanding driving conditions on the Buffalo  Pittsburg highway, often passing through isolated forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be aware of the steep slopes, narrow passages, and sharp curves.
The prescribed speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections, usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) and strict adherence to the limits is more important than usual.
Interestingly, however, cell service is better here than on many other sections of the road, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bakery products are quite good and varied in Bavaria, as in the southern neighbors of the Austrians.
Fruit-based pastry is common, with apples being added to year-round delicacies and cherries and plums being used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nutty fruits.
If you fancy a small but hearty treat, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish that is based on herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
"Depending on the amount of liquid, curry can be either "dry" or "wet".
Yogurt is a common ingredient in curry in the interior of northern India and Pakistan; in southern India and some coastal parts of the subcontinent, coconut milk is the most commonly used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is the umbrella term for a multitude of regional cuisines across the country.
But when used without further qualification, the term denotes food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago, and consists of a variety of simply seasoned dishes that are dominated by Javanese favorites of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
They are steep supports for the rider's legs that hang from either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but they also involve certain safety risks because the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his leg is caught in a saddle, the horse may pull him if he escapes.
First, most riders wear heeled boots with smooth, narrow soles.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety pins that allow the strap of the saddle to be released from the saddle if the rider pulls it back in a fall.
The Cochamó Valley is a major climbing destination in Chile, also known as South America's Yosemite due to its diversity of large granite cliffs and ridges.
Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes amid the endless possibilities it offers.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending a snow slope using a ski or snowboard attached to the legs.
"Skiing is an important travel activity, and many people known as 'ski lovers' plan their annual holidays around skiing at a particular location".
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
The sport of downhill skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking and skiing: also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, though usually not.
Think of a ski trail as a similar mountain trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover a little more distance than walking, but you will very rarely reach the speed of skiing without a heavy backpack on the paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is made up of many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean applying for a visa and passing passport controls several times.
The Schengen area, however, in this respect functions as one country.
As long as you're in that zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control.
Similarly, if you hold a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa in each Schengen Member State individually, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There's no universal definition of antiquities, but some tax authorities define antiquities as goods that are over 100 years old.
There are geographical differences in the definition, so the age limit in places like North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handmade products may be called antiques even though they are later than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer farming is an important source of income for the Sami people, and the trade-related culture is important to many other professions.
Traditionally, however, not all Sámi people were involved in reindeer husbandry on a large scale, but lived off fishing, hunting, and the reindeer served mainly as a draught.
Today, many Sámi are engaged in modern crafts, and tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi region of Sápmi.
"Although the word 'gypsy' is widely used, especially among non-Roma people, it is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma".

A storm is a generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world in a variety of forms, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, thunderstorms, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are all forms and effects of dangerous weather conditions, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, downpours, and cyclones.

Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad must bring valid documents with them on their return.
The willingness to issue passports without an X or updated documents to match the desired name and gender varies from government to government.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor such documents also varies from government to government.
Search at checkpoints also became more drastic in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender people who haven't had surgery are unlikely to pass the scanner without compromising their privacy and dignity.
A rip current is a backflow of waves that crashes against a shore, often a reef or something.
Because of the underground topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper parts and it's possible to create a fast current towards greater depths.
Death mostly occurs when a person gets tired trying to swim against the current, which is often impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back is no harder than it used to be.
Try to swim so as not to be caught again by the current or, depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted, you can wait for help.
The shock of returning to one's culture occurs before the cultural shock, the enjoyment phase is shorter, the shock lasts longer and can be more severe.

In remote areas where there is no coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
Satellite phone is not a replacement for mobile phone because you have to make a call in the open and the satellite has to be in your line of sight to make the call.
The service is often used in forwarding, on recreational vessels, but also on expeditions that need remote data and voice transmission.
The telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a year off is to travel and study.

"Finland is a great destination for sailing. 'The land of a thousand lakes' has thousands of islands on lakes and in coastal archipelagos".
You don't necessarily need a yacht for the archipelago and the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are large enough for yachts, sailing in smaller boats or kayaks is a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, which has one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
The situation is similar in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most notable Baltic cruises include an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days, and then return at night and sleep on the boat.
If you travel overland as part of a boat trip, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There is no shame in that: it is no different from the fears and disgust that many people feel toward some other things.
Understanding how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can help some to overcome fear of the unknown or a lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for their fast delivery of shipments, often a time of extreme importance when it comes to business documents, merchandise or spare parts for emergency repairs.
Some routes have larger companies flying their own planes, but the problem has arisen on other routes and with smaller companies.
If cargo were sent by air, unloading and customs clearance on some routes would take days.
The only way to make this go faster is to send things as checked baggage, which is why according to airline regulations, baggage can't travel without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
It is understood that you will be able to fly first or business class if you reserve a thicker bundle of bills for the privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: generally speaking, expect to pay up to four times the normal price of economy class seats, or eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, it makes no sense to ask for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airline companies are well aware that a certain group of passengers is willing to pay a large sum of money for the privilege of a quick and comfortable journey, and they set prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau, and the language spoken is Romanian, though Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has faced ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established despite the failure of political negotiations.
The Orthodox faith is the majority religion in Moldova.

Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by nonbelievers in Christian lands and by non-Christians around the world.
It is customary on Easter night to wake up in an open place to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian fertility rite to celebrate the coming of spring.
In more traditional churches, the Vigil of Lent is often held on Saturday evenings during the Easter weekend, and communities begin the celebration of Christ's resurrection with the clock striking midnight.
Most animals originally arrived on the islands by swimming, flying, or floating.

Japanese work culture is much more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
In the workplace, people wear suits, and coworkers call each other by their last name or by their position in the workplace.
The role of the workplace is of crucial importance - the emphasis is on the collective effort, not the praise of individual achievements.
Workers must often seek the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
