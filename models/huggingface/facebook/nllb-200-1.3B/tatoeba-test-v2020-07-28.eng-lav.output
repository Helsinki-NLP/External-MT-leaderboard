When an English speaker realizes that a foreign person they are talking to does not understand one of their sentences, they repeat it, the same way, but louder, as if the person were deaf. At no point does it come to their mind that their vocabulary might be complicated or that their expression might most likely be ambiguous to a foreigner and that they could reword it in a simpler way. The result is that not only does the person still not understand, but they get irritated at being considered deaf.
