Welsh councillors are worried about looking like a bunch of shit.
Some members of the council are concerned by a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
Concerns have been raised over a plan to change the name of the council to the Welsh Parliament.
Councillors from all parties are concerned that this could lead to a backlash.
One Labour councillor said his party was concerned that rhyme with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means stupid and pwp means dirty.
A spokesman for Plaid Cymru said the party as a whole was "delighted" and had made other proposals for the campaign.
A Welsh Conservative councillor said his party was "open to the idea" of changing the name, but pointed out that there was no big difference between the word MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is borrowed similarly to the Icelandic u.
The Council, now working on a bill to propose the name changes, said: "The decision on all titles applied to members of the Council will, of course, be left to the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the council released the results of a public opinion poll that showed strong support for calling the council the Welsh Assembly.
As for the title of the councillors, the council chose WMP (Welsh Parliament members) but MWP received the most support from the public in the opinion polls.
According to reports, councillors are now making other proposals, but it could prove difficult to reach agreement for the council's chairman, Elin Jones, who is due to table a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform proposal will also include other changes to the way the Council works, including rules on the breakdown of councillors and the organisation of the committee system.
Councillors will be able to vote on their title once the debate on the Bill begins.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The issue was put to a vote in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbors was equivalent to its territory, and it has repeatedly opposed their applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the name change, has said that he will not consider the election valid.
However, supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said that the name change is simply the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
The church bell of St. Martin's is silent. The churches in Harlem are in trouble.
"The elderly people I have spoken to say that in the past you could find a bar and a church on every street corner", Mr Adams said.
Today, neither is there.
He said that it was understandable that children were going to decline.
"People have other ways to meet people nowadays", he said.
 Bars are no longer the focal point of the neighborhood where people regularly gather.
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders are expected to, and sooner or later they will be back on their feet.
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings full of people who would not help save the remaining neighborhood's burned-out buildings.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he said, "and this will result in the immediate closure of these churches altogether, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a center of black community - the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and St. Martin's Church a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1940's.
A congregation of Tehuelche who had served in the area took over the building.
The congregation of the Blacksmiths took over St. Martin's Church under the leadership of Sir John Howard Johnson, who had the initiative of rounding up shopkeepers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who threatened to hire black workers or give them station raises.
The building was severely damaged by a fire in 1939, but members of Sir Johnson's congregation made plans to rebuild it, including the clockwork.
Sir David Johnson, the son and successor of Sir Johnson, called the clock the pride of the poor.
The expert who played the clock in July called it by another name: cultural treasure and unique historical instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the world's first clockwork instrument played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger clockwork instrument in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had no one else to replace him.
In recent months, numerous architects and builders have made their way to St. Martin, some hired by church leaders and others by the diocese.
The Church Council - which oversees the congregation and is made up of church leaders - wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese was trying to pass the costs on to the council, even though it had no part in hiring the architects and builders sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of respect for half the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy who was fishing for lobster in California is injured by a shark
Authorities say a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark while scavenging for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about 30 minutes on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then rode over with a group of others to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just the excitement of having caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was yelling "I've been bitten!"
I was bitten!
All his bones were torn up, "Hammel told of what he saw when he came to the boy.
"I shouted at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is critically injured.
The species of shark that attacked the boy is unknown.
The coast guard's chief, Larry Giles, told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe upper-body injuries.
Authorities closed the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, for research and security reasons.
Giles said that there are over 135 different species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's with plans to take over the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is set to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with a shopping centre-style make-up line and a dedicated support staff.
This is part of a plan to tap into the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which is growing as fashion and home sales decline.
Investing in beauty products is part of a supermarket's way of using up space previously used by telescopes, microwave ovens and home appliances.
Sainsbury's says it plans to double its cosmetics range to a total of 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have increased space with marked areas similar to those found in stores like Boots.
The store also plans to restart sales of its Boutique range of products, with most of the items being vegan-friendly, but with younger consumers demanding it more and more.
In addition, the fragrance shop will test the range of products in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened in Croydon, south London last week and the next will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the increasing tendency of consumers to buy small amounts of food daily in local stores means that supermarkets have to work harder to attract people to their stores.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the stores would increasingly resemble shopping centres as the chain tries to fight off the low-end grocery stores Aldi and Lidl with more service and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has installed Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat stores since the two chains were acquired two years ago, which it says has increased sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
The store's earlier attempt to revive its cosmetics and pharmaceutical businesses failed.
Sainsbury's tried a partnership with Boots around 2000, but it ended due to disagreement over how to share the proceeds of drug sales in the supermarkets.
The new policy follows Sainsbury's's sale of its 281 pharmacy shops to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds pharmacy shops, for £125 million three years ago.
Under the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in these plans by adding a wide range of luxury leather goods brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to the four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, marketing manager at Sainsbury's, said: 'We have redesigned the look of our cosmetics to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specific training for staff who will be on hand for consultations.
Our range of products is designed to meet all needs.Healthy environments and convenient locations make us an exciting beauty store that transforms old business practices.
Peter Jones is in a state of shock after Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal.
Peter Jones, star of Dragons' Den, became a celebrity after TV presenter Holly Willoughby left his company's £11 million contract to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their home furnishings and accessories brand, Truly.
The company had been compared to Goop, a brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, 37, a presenter on This Morning, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left behind Peter Jones, star of Dragons' Den, with a painful legacy of quitting a popular lifestyle company at the last minute to focus on new and lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was the focus of a difficult meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when the popular TV presenter admitted she didn't have enough time for the home goods and accessories brand Truly due to new deals worth up to £1.5 million.
The company has been likened to Goop, a brand of Gwyneth Paltrow, and was intended to double Willoughby's assets, but their estimated value is £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was planning to pull out of Truly, Jones flew from the UK to stay at one of her many summer homes.
A source told the paper: "Truly was a long-time priority for Holly.
This was to be her future project, which would provide her with income for the next two decades.
Her decision to quit completely shocked everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so short of a line to market.
There's a full stock of goods at Marlow headquarters that are ready to go on sale.
Experts believe that the collapse of This Morning, one of Britain's most popular brands, could cost the company millions in heavy investment in products ranging from pillows and blankets to clothing and home furnishings, possibly adding to the cost of the line's sales.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends with Jones and his wife, Toru Capp, for a decade.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple spend their summer vacations together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in the television production company Baldwin.
Willoughby will become the official brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
Mr. Jones, the landlord, said last night, "We don't want to say anything about his business".
Tough arguments and then we fell in love
He was bracing for the media criticism for saying something that many would consider inappropriate for a president, and for being so positive in the court of the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given so much?
Said Trump, echoing the voice of a reporter.
I haven't left anything behind.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second summit after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
However, talks on the disarmament of nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not received an "appropriate response" from the United States to North Korea's first steps toward nuclear disarmament.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continued to harass trade with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump was much more positive in his speech.
"We're getting along very well with North Korea", he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
Now we have a wonderful relationship.
He said his efforts to mend relations with Kim had yielded positive results - missile tests had been halted, hostages had been freed, and the remains of American soldiers had been returned home.
He also defended his unusual approach to discussing his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into the packed stadium, there were only 200 people standing there", Trump said, referring to the crowd in front of him.
Floods and earthquakes in Indonesia cause extensive damage to islands, hundreds are lost
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, international aid agencies were told that they were not needed.
Although over 10 percent of the population of Lombok was forced to flee their homes, no state of emergency was declared, but it is a prerequisite for international aid operations to be carried out there.
'IN MANY cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they will not ask for help from international organisations, so this is difficult,' Ms Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear when foreign aid workers will be able to begin work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the country's customs agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations should be allowed to assist in the relief work.
Given the frequency of earthquakes, Indonesia is sadly ill-equipped to deal with natural disasters.
Flood controls have been built in Aceh, but they are a rare sight on other coastlines.
It seems that the number of deaths from the tsunami in Palau has increased even after the warning was issued.
Even under the best of conditions, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia can be a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate planning.
An ambulance that has been docked in Lombok to pick up the earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new site.
President Joko Widodo made it a priority of his election campaign to rebuild Indonesia's declining transportation system, and he has invested heavily in roads and railways.
The lack of funds has plagued Mr. Joko's administration, but elections are scheduled for next year.
Mr. Joko also has to contend with the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative religious outlook.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with clubs, bows, and arrows and other primitive weapons.

Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was sent off by Xherdan Shaqiri, 30 yards from Chelsea's goal as his side were down 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then tried to hit the goal in the direction of the goal post.
The ball went high over the goal line and to the right of the goal line.
The ball eventually went over the Arrizabalaga Cup, which bounced up, and into the net.
"I just wanted to try to get in this position, to get the ball, and players like Shaq he always played as forward as possible so I tried to create as much time for myself as I could", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante come and touch once and didn't think much about it, just took the shot.
Chelsea were 1-0 up at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
In the attack, the Chelsea striker passed the ball with a heel heel to Mateo Kovacic and then sprinted from the centre over the Liverpool goal line.
Kovacic made the ball go fast through the middle.
Then he delivers the ball and sends Hazard in for a touchdown.
Hazard outmaneuvered the defenders and scored a long-range shot from a left-footed shot by Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Flood in Indonesia Raises the Death toll to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's port authority announced early Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the organization, told a news conference that dozens of people were buried when buildings collapsed in Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which caused floodwaters as high as 20 feet [6 m].
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was covered with rubble.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with a stab wound was found at 7:55 this morning near Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to report any sightings or reports.
Brian O'Hagan, the commissioner of the inquiry, said: "The inquiry is just beginning, but I would ask anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they see or hear anything suspicious.
I would also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured something with their car cameras to contact us, as they may have provided important information for our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who died lived in Birkenhead and that she was found inside a flat.
Later today, people who thought they knew the woman have come to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and police say they are working to bring the victim's next of kin to their attention.
A taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one could enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he realized what had happened.
Residents have now been told that many hours may pass before they are allowed to reenter.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area now seemed to be a crime scene.
A weeping woman came on the scene.
She kept saying, "This is so horrible".
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were inside the police marked area and one car was just outside.
A number of police officers stood within the designated area, watching the apartment complexes.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Public Safety Hotline anonymously on 0800 555 111 and give the number 247 as of September 30th.
The statue of Cromwell in the British Parliament is the latest monument to be accused of "rewrite history"
The banning of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban's destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious demons by his ultra-Orthodox Puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, said Mr. Crick's proposal was "a fraud" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace would be the first to be removed.
The spirit of the English Civil War against the cultural heritage was neither the order nor the execution of Cromwell.
If he were to fail, Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas over the previous century.
The splendid statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, marks the turn of the 19th century and is a part of human history that many still consider worthy of praise.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps rather late in the 19th century than today, to have been the protector of Parliament against outside pressure, in his case the monarchy.
Whether this description is accurate in the main is still a matter of considerable historical controversy.
However, it is certain that the struggles of the mid-17th century have shaped the development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a well-known figure representing one side of those struggles.
His courage as a protector of the state is worthy of praise and commemoration.
A pig attacks a Chinese farmer and kills him
A pig attacked and killed a Chinese farmer in a market in southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a broken armpit and covered in blood near a stove at the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a poison into pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Reportedly, he had traveled with his uncle from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his uncle found him dead, and he saw that the door to a nearby pigsty was open.
He said that inside the mound there was a large pit with a bloody mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilograms of mercury had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My uncle's feet were bloody and bruised", the uncle, surnamed Wu, told the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The owner of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked in so that it would not attack anyone else while police gathered evidence at the scene.
According to reports, the Yuan family and the market's owners are negotiating compensation for his death.
There are recorded instances of pigs attacking people, although this is rare.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig at their Massachusetts home, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a Welsh farmer's 300-pound pig was pinned to a tractor until his wife dropped it on the cliff.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that bloodletting can trigger aggression.
They're just playing.
They like to play and they're curious... they don't want to hurt anybody.
You just have to show them the proper respect", he said.
The remnants of the Rose's widow is causing a great flood in the southwestern United States
As foretold, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it passes through cooler ports along the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring with it a heavy rainfall that could cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Tropical Storm Rosa became a Category 1 hurricane with winds of up to 85 miles per hour (136 km/ h) at 5 a.m. Eastern Time Sunday, and it was located roughly 370 miles (600 km) southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is scheduled to head north on Sunday.
As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, a large tropical storm will follow it northward into the southwestern United States.
The dew will follow up to 25 inches of precipitation in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical rock will mix with the approaching slopes to form a large, wide-spread outburst over the southwest over the next few days.
A vertical drop of 2.5 to 10 centimeters can cause dangerous flash flooding, landslides, and possible landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical rainfall will produce as much as two to three inches of precipitation per hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to two to three inches [5-10 cm] of precipitation is expected in some places in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
The possibility of sudden floods with rapidly changing conditions is due to the way tropical cyclones are distributed.
People are strongly advised against going out on foot into the desert when the threat of tropical erosion is looming.
Heavy rains can quickly turn the valleys into swamps, and thunderstorms can bring torrential winds and thunderstorms.
The approaching storm will bring localized flooding to certain areas of the Southern California coastline.
There is a possibility of a 1 cm of precipitation that could cause minor movement on the ground and bumps on the road.
This is the first harvest of the rainy season.
A few scattered tropical storms will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the storm spreads over a larger area late Monday and Tuesday.
A massive drought will spread across four states on Tuesday and end on Wednesday.
A high temperature change is expected throughout the United States in October as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain moderately warm.
Sometimes this can cause severe heat waves over short distances.
A very good example of extreme heat was seen in the central United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the permanent summer clouds will try to build up and dissipate again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to warm up by early October, with temperatures of about 80 degrees Fahrenheit [25°C] or more from the plains in the south all the way to the northeastern states.
Temperatures could reach 80 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which is about six degrees above average.
Our long-range forecast indicates that there is a strong likelihood of above-average temperatures for the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people tuned in to watch Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people watched Tuesday's emotional testimony by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sex crime alleged to have occurred in the 1990s, broadcast on six different networks.
Meanwhile, political tensions continued to rise, and television stations took a break from their regular schedules to air breaking news on Friday: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake proposed a bill that would allow the FBI to investigate the allegations for one week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was convinced that Kavanaugh had drugged her drunk and tried to strip her naked at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a moving statement that he was certain it hadn't happened.
It's likely that more people watched the trial than the 20.4 million Nielsen said had watched on Friday.
The company measured the average viewing time of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other television networks that aired the hearings, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people's opinions in offices.
To put this in context, this audience is similar in size to the size of a football playoff or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, the most-watched segment of the day, the Fox News Channel, was 5.69 million viewers, and the network's analysts have been staunchly supportive of Kavanaugh's nomination.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest continued after the trial.
Flake was the center of the action on Friday.
After the Republican senator's office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, close to CNN and CBS footage showed him being accosted by protesters on Friday morning as he tried to enter an elevator to attend a meeting of the House Judiciary Committee.
He stood face down for a few minutes as a cloud of shame fell on him live on CNN.
A woman said, "I'm standing right in front of you".
Do you think he's telling the truth to his countrymen?
People said to him, "You are a king, while so many women stand for power".
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the doors of the pharmacy closed, he said he would make a further comment at the committee meeting.
The cable and television stations all later broadcast live when the Judiciary Committee considered whether to send Kavanaugh's nomination forward for Senate consideration.
Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee next week, but a minority of Democrats have urged it.
Flake was convinced, in part, by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and several other senators after that.
Flake's vote was a toss-up because it was clear that the Republicans didn't have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has authorized an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
May, UK Prime Minister, accuses critics of playing politics with Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing politics with Britain's future and undermining the country's interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In a second interview, published alongside her interview on the front page of the paper, Boris Johnson, her former foreign secretary, acknowledged the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that the suggestion that Britain and the EU should cancel each other's tariffs was "totally unsound".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson in connection with the LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and jailed on a charge of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, saying Sims lost his glasses in the fights.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, CBS's sister network.
The police say that Simpson confessed to the interrogation that he shot Wayde and killed him.
According to his lawyer, the amount of the security deposit was $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge County coroner's office released an emergency report Friday saying the cause of death was gunshot wounds to the head and neck.
Authorities thanked the Louisiana State Police, the Louisiana Department of Criminal Investigation, the Southern University Police Department and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU athletic director, thanked law enforcement for their "hard work and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-2 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 assists per game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that the team was "very disappointed and shocked" by Wayde's passing.
"It's something you worry about all the time", Wade said.
A volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised residents of Mexico City on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the volcano's activity increased, with 183 cases of gas and ash discharges recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center observed the tremors and tremors of the volcano.
Social media photos showed a thin layer of ash on the wheels of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geologists have noted increased activity in the volcano, located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, since an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists just before independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands of people took part in a protest marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's controversial vote to declare independence.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs at riot police and sprayed paint that formed a dark dust cloud on the streets, which were usually crowded with tourists.
Attacks also broke out later that day, and police used baths to contain the attacks.
For several hours, groups of separatists shouted: "We will not forget and we will not forgive", while their opponents shouted in response: "Long live Spain!"
Fourteen needed emergency medical treatment for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
The region remains under intense tension one year after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by Madrid authorities but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters supported independence, but turnout was low, as most of those opposed to secession ignored the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were killed last year when police tried to stop the vote at polling stations across the region, but that led to clashes.
Groups of independents had stayed out all night on Friday to prevent a protest in support of the country's police.
The opposing party went ahead, but was forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, joined the separatist demonstrations with his wife and said that he no longer had hope that Catalonia would gain independence.
Last year we had some of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could get married, but now we are stuck", he said.
Despite winning a crucial but modest victory in regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to keep up steam this year, with many of their best-known leaders either in voluntary exile or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police-support demonstration on her phone, said that politicians from both counties had encouraged the dispute.
"The tension is increasing", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in jail awaiting trial since late last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
'My proposal for a European Constitution is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen the Spanish government practice,' he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly breaking into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30pm, UK time.
Bob Blemmings, the investigator, said that the gate and the building itself had been damaged.
It's also possible that the shot was fired from a crossbow in the direction of the vehicle.
Scored in the 1-0 win Livingston against the Rangers
Dolly Singer's first score ensured a win for Livingston
Livingston's lower-league side came into the Rangers' open and Steven Gerrard had to endure his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox side.
Mark Dolly Menga made the breakthrough and Gary Holt's team is now in second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team have yet to win a away game in the Premier League this season and will face Hearts, who are eight points clear of the top flight, next Sunday.
Before that game, the Rangers will take on Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is still undefeated in the league with six wins, and Holt's head coach has yet to suffer a loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is losing opportunities against a host of uninvited guests.
The Holts should have been over long before they scored, but their right-hand shot caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then shot a forward pass after running through the defence to take a shell from Graig Halkett across the goal.
The hosts let the Rangers play in front of them calmly, knowing that they could cause trouble for the visitors in the right places.
And that was how the milestone was reached.
The Rangers took on an extra-left wing and Livingston worked to create a fielding opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson assisted Menga in a combined effort, which took the air and scored from mid-air.
At that point, the Rangers had the ball, but the home side was unstoppable, and Liam Kelly, the goalkeeper, didn't have to put much effort in.
This continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos was able to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot from the field after a strike from Livingston.
A shot was consistently dropped in Livingston's ruling, but was kicked off, and two claims for a free-kick - for Halkett's defense against his replacement Glenn Middleton, and one for a hand - were dismissed.
The Livingston's - A Look at the
Alasdair Lamont, a reporter for BBC Scotland, at the Tony Macaroni Stadium
A great performance and a great result for Livingston.
For the average person, they did very well, continuing to exceed all expectations in their upbringing.
Their playing style and team members have hardly changed since their return to the top flight, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for having brushed the team together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, the foreman, was a great one, leading a full-court defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the ropes the whole time.
The Rangers, on the other hand, lacked inspiration.
As good as they've been under Gerrard's leadership, they've played far below expectations.
They've had a bad end to their offense and only once managed to open the batting in the home team, so this should be a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are now sitting in the middle of the league.
Erdogan receives a glitzy reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), the skies were bright and smiling as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is intended to improve relations between the two NATO nations.
There has been some friction between them over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, gigantic mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey itself.
Police used security measures to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but crowds of supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also joined in, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
The two opposition groups reflect the controversial nature of this visitor, hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and hated as a dictator by others.
Deptford collision: A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics performed emergency surgery, but the man died at the scene.
The crash came months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident.
The police said that they were working to identify the man and to notify his closest associates.
The road is being closed and buses are being diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six inmates were injured in riots
Six inmates were injured when rioting broke out in a high-security men's prison, according to a report from the Bureau of Prisons.
Riots broke out in Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday and are still raging.
Tornado Special Forces have been called to the area to try to contain the riots, as eight prisoners are injured, and are alone in the single cell of the prison.
The guards were evacuated due to minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the Prison Reform Commission said: "Special guards have been called in to deal with the situation at Long Lartin Prison.
Six employees have been placed on injured reserve.
There is no violence in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may expect to spend even more time behind bars beating people.
More than 500 inmates are held at Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the warden had to go to the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, riot police were called to the scene to deal with a serious disturbance of the peace, where workers were attacked with billiard balls.
Tropical Storm Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flash floods (drought areas may benefit)
Tropical storms are rare in Arizona, but they are likely early next week when remnants of Hurricane Rosa cross the southwest, threatening flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and southern and western Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is scheduled to make a direct flight over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late on Monday with a delivery.
The Phoenix Weather Bureau tweeted that only 80 tornadoes have maintained their strength to be classified as tropical or subtropical storms within 200 miles (320 km) of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64 km) of the Arizona border.
The latest projections from the National Volcanoes Center predict a 5 to 10 inch rainfall, with one drop of up to 15 inches at the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas in the southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and The Great Basin, are likely to be 2.5 to 5 cm, with the possibility of single deposits of up to 10 cm.
For those who are not at risk of being caught in flash floods, the relief from Roseau could be a blessing, since the region is experiencing severe drought.
Although flooding can cause much damage, some of this precipitation will have a positive effect, since drought is now in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Protection Agency, at least 40 percent of Arizona is extremely dry, which is the second-highest category, according to a report from weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa was still classified as a tropical storm Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 86 miles per hour, and is located 400 miles (620 km) south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving northward at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is moving across the warm Pacific Ocean, and its power is decreasing.
Therefore, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
There is a high potential for flooding in some areas of Mexico, with a significant risk of flooding.
"We're seeing precipitation of up to 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and into northwestern Sonora, with the potential for up to 25 cm of precipitation", said a weather.com report.
Rosa will then continue northward over Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical storm, then continue up through Arizona and reach southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The highest risk of the expected loss of the rose or its remains is very high precipitation in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the southwest desert region of the United States", said the National Hurricane Center.
This is expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and landslides in the deserts and mountain landscapes.
The Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenage player was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 0400 hours British time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition is said to be "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset Police.
The police have asked any witnesses who may have phone records of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh has been feeling the anger and the anger of the Democratic Party.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and despicable practices of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "felt the malice and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he hardened allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified before the committee about his allegations.
The president said Saturday that "Americans have seen the genius and the manhood and the courage" of Kavanaugh over the past day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that confirms one of the most brilliant lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a stellar record as a public servant", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president was indirectly referring to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republican supporters getting involved in the midterm elections.
We're five weeks into one of the most important elections of our lives.
"I'm not offering, but I'm really offering", he said.
That's why I'm going around the stadium to fight for great candidates.
Trump claimed that Democrats were working to "kill and hinder".
The first floor committee of the Senate will vote on Kavanaugh's nomination no later than Friday, according to the Republican vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds were killed by an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the death toll is likely to rise
At least 384 people were killed and many more were stranded in a huge sand dune on the coast of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, when a massive earthquake and tsunami ripped through the island, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when as much as six meters of water swept ashore at sunset, washing many people out to sea and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami formed yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately evacuate, so it was a fatality", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Port Authority, told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't just come, it took cars, wooden drums, houses, everything on land", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at a speed of 500 miles [800 km] before hitting the coast.
Some climbed trees to escape the waves, and they survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were moved to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the Port Authority showed many destroyed buildings and shops, snow-covered and unusable bridges, and moss surrounding the water.
The quake continued to strike the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes struck a region of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Institute of Food and Technology said in a statement that the energy released by the tremor on Friday was about 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb dropped on the city of Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geographic location, at the end of a long, gentle flood, may have increased the size of the floodplain, the agency said.
Nugroho said the damage was "serious" and that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of several victims were found trapped under rubble from collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and property damage could be higher along the coastline 300 kilometers north of Palu in an area called Donggala, which is near the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication is down and there is no information from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"Over 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse", said the Red Cross.
The agency was criticized by many on Saturday for not reporting that a tidal wave had hit Palu, even though officials said the waves had come before the warning was issued.
In a video posted on social media, a man could be heard shouting from the top of a building to warn people on the street below of the approaching flood.
Within minutes, a flood surges onto the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that disrupted communications across Palu and made it difficult for authorities to plan relief efforts.
The military has begun sending relief planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to officials, but people who have been helped by the region are still in dire need of food and other necessities.
The city's airport has only recently been reopened for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit a refugee camp in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has exceeded 800.
The situation is very bad.
World Vision staff from Donggala have made it safely to the city of Palu, where they are taking shelter in tent cities set up in the garden outside their offices.
"People said they saw many houses with no windows", he said.
The situation is very bad.
Aid groups have begun to do a difficult rescue, but some have complained that foreign aid workers with high expertise are being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funds, supplies and personnel can only start coming if the accident site is declared a port area.
It hasn't been done yet.
"This is still the site of the accident", said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the government has declared it a port area, we can open it to foreign aid, but no declaration has come yet.
As the second night fell on Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing kept hoping that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that would bring hope to the devastating predictions that come with natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a burrow.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under a bed for two days with her mother's body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian water polo team, had been the coach of two now missing water polo players for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were locked inside the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mr. Mandagi.
"As a man with a lot of experience in the sulphur industry, I have my own emotional burden to bear", he said.
Mr Gendon said that within hours of the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse reaching the airline team, he sent a desperate WhatsApp message to the contestants staying in Palu, who were attending the beach party.
His message, however, showed only gray, not blue, signs.
"I think it means that the messages were not received", he said.
Thieves steal 26,750 dollars from a high-speed bank in Newport on the Levee.
On Friday morning, thieves stole 26,750 pounds from a Brink employee who was filling a speedster in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been filling a speed bump at the amusement park and was about to fill it with more money, police commissioner Dennis McCarthy said in the report.
While he was at work, another man came running behind the Brink employee and stole a purse that was meant for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects fleeing the scene, according to the report, but police did not say how many were involved.
Anyone with information about the suspects is asked to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: "Veran formerly known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He will replace Arianna Grandi in the show, who left for "emotional reasons", the show's producer said.
West has previously stated that this name has religious significance for him, but it is also an abbreviation of his current name.
"I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, meaning the one, to just Ye -- to just being a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the messed up, everything.
The record is more a reflection of who we are.
He is one of many famous wrestlers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, West's former co-worker, has also written his name both with and without the hyphen and the acronym.
The president-elect of Mexico is called upon not to use force against civilians.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the president-elect of Mexico, has vowed never to use military force against civilians, as that country will soon mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody student uprising.
On Saturday in the Tlatelolco plaza, Lopez Obrador vowed to "never, ever use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful protest in the square, killing up to 300 people as left-wing student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by giving all students a monthly stipend and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational skills lead young people to crime.
The United States should double its funding for AI
With China's growing interest in AI, the United States should double its investment in AI research, says inventor and AI researcher Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The controversy was sparked by the release of intelligence reports by various branches of the U.S. government, even though the United States has no official comprehensive intelligence program.
But China announced its plan last year: it aims to be the world's leading innovator in AI by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the amount of money going into satellite research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are waiting to see the next big breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence", Lee said.
Doubling the funding could double the odds that the next big AI discovery will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order which was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies.
He worked on artificial intelligence systems in the 1990s at Carnegie Mellon University, won the Best Actor in America for Othello, and later was CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese division of Google.
Lee spoke of previous technology competitions held by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Department's robotics competition, and asked when the next competition would be held, to spotlight the next innovators.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants, said Lee.
"It's not China that is attracting the mainstream, it's the corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring university geniuses to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its intelligence research.
'I think that those who have a PhD in artificial intelligence should be granted automatic residence permits,' he said.
The Chinese National Congress released its Future Action Plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people who work at the universities, similar to the National Science Foundation and similar public institutions in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an AI center, which is intended to work with both industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a dedicated AI committee.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it invests over 100 million dollars a year in research into artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the U.S. law, which was supposed to create a safety council for artificial intelligence, has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia" in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their application to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, and it claims that the name of its neighbors to the north is equivalent to a claim on their territory, and therefore denies them membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June that was based on the new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will erode the identity of the majority of Macedonia's population of Slavic origin.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the vote, and the campaign to ignore it has raised doubts about whether turnout will reach the 50 percent threshold needed for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: 'Do you want to join NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a fair price for Macedonia to join alliances such as the EU and NATO, but the country is one of those formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
'I came today to vote for the future of the country for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us,' said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the decision is not legally binding, many members of Congress have said that they will follow it and make it a law.
The name change would require the approval of two-thirds of the Senate.
The election commission said that nothing unusual had been reported at 1 o'clock in the afternoon.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe, said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko cast their votes in the referendum in Macedonia on whether to change the country's name, which would pave its way into NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, worked to prepare a small stage and set up chairs in front of a tent erected by those who would ignore the vote.
'We are proud of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through the service doors,' said Kavardarkov.
We are a poor country, but we live with dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China or Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed funds to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
'I think the vast majority will agree that over 80 per cent of the country's citizens are committed to the EU and NATO,' Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that the agreement would be "the guarantee of our future".
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, but that is below the minimum required.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those who said yes, 70 percent said yes.
For a referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote is not passed, it could mean the first serious blow to the policy of the Western-led government since it took office last May.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero goes through all of Brighton's defence and scores.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a light defence in Brighton's 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a delivery in the middle of the field at the start of the attack.
He passed three Brighton defenders and then went out on the open court.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green-coated defenders.
He passed one defender and then passed several more just outside Brighton's home.
Then he sent to the left and found Sterling there.
The English striker used the first touch of the wicket to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to play Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right side of the goal.
"Aguero has some foot problems", City boss Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then this happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave them their first blue in the playoffs.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a transmission deep inside the ballpark in Brighton in that attack.
He threw a nice long left to Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball a few times and then sent Sterling toward the spring.
The City forward threw the ball into the net just before he ran out.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12.55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a no-show against the Rockies.
Since the Nationals have been excluded from playing in the finals, there was little reason to force a second start.
But the aggressive Scherzer hopes to get a pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance to make the playoffs, but they're one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Conference.
The Rockies at least got a wildcard berth with their 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but the team is still looking to win its first division title.
So even though we're playing for free, we can at least play for the electrified atmosphere of Denver, as well as the team that will surely play their best game of the year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in such a situation?
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be the starting pitcher for Sunday's game, but it is believed that they will let Scherzer pitch in these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was starting for the 34th time, took a practice draw on Thursday and would throw on Sunday, his usual day of rest.
This right-handed pitcher at Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump to visit West Virginia
The president was indirectly referring to the case surrounding Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, when he spoke of the importance of Republican supporters taking part in the midterm elections.
Everything is on the line for November.
We're five weeks into one of the most important elections of our lives.
These are some of the big, big... I don't propose, but I do, so I go around the field to fight for great candidates", he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this horrible, radical group of Democrats, you can see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power by any means necessary, you see the cruel, the evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go over to get power and control, they just want power and control, we don't give it to them.
He said that Democrats were working on "disrupting and hindering".
"And it's been seen for the last four days", he said, "and said the Democrats are "bitch and mean and cruel and untruthful".
He named Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and was met with a loud cheer from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Oh, what?
No, no, no, I was waiting for one... it was a really bad physical, the worst I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a church.
He does not tolerate anyone who expresses his opinion
When the Momentum activists in my group offered to give me a recommendation, it came as little surprise to me.
I am after all the latest of many Labour MPs to have been told that we are not welcome, just for expressing our views.
My fellow congressman, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she was strongly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the suggestion of giving me a warrant came about because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were the importance of having a responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, a coldly similar issue that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders about.
The notice of the meeting for Nottingham East on Friday said that 'we want the meetings to be informative and productive'.
In my eight years as a Labour MP, Friday meetings have been about that.
Unfortunately, that is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of "more tolerant and better" politics has been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that differences of opinion are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that all opinions are judged by whether the party leadership finds them objectionable.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues, who I had previously thought shared similar political views as myself, began to expect me to take a complete back seat and support views that I had never before agreed with, whether it was on national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak in public - and it doesn't matter what I say - it's followed by a barrage of social media smears calling for my resignation, denying my media membership and telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because most of the comments I get are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and the tenacity of those who have to endure the ravages of sexual or prejudicial abuse on a daily basis but never give up.
One of the most frustrating things about this political era is the extent to which assault and aggression have become a normal part of daily life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should be slowing down on the cultural shift.
The reality is that we are no longer a moderate church, and with every dissent or change in the rules of the church, the group will grow weaker.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years about how to wear low, not too high, and then I'd be fine.
But I chose not to get involved in politics to do so.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, spurred on by the neglect of the Thatcher government that left my schoolroom in ruins, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, whether I was on the council or in Parliament.
I've never hidden my political views, not even during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can have any doubt about my policies and where I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who voted for the motion on Friday, I can only say that as this country heads towards Brexit, which will damage our homes, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to spend time and energy in loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But my one message, which I want to send from me, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those within my constituency, whether they are Labour Party members or not: I serve you with pride and I promise that no threats of abdication or political defiance will deter me from doing what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Undefeated team Ayr goes to the top
Two late touches may have changed the final score somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr had the victory sealed in that day's sudden match in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the top team in the league and the only team out of ten that is still undefeated.
In the end, it was their stronger defence and better use of opportunities that made the home side the victors, and Peter Murchie's coach had every right to be pleased.
"We have faced tough opposition in our games so far and are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "They deserve credit, they took their chances better than we did,
Mark Grant Anderson came on in the 14th minute after Frazier Climo turned the offense around, but a yellow card on the Scottish forward, who was allowed to play the game against the Warriors, allowed Melrose to let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot to score a touchdown.
Climo played to Ayr's lead with a wide before kicking a goal just before half-time and then a touchdown to bring Ayr over 17-5 in the half.
But Melrose started the second half with a power play and Patrick Anderson's touchdown, after Baggot's tackle, reduced the margin to five points.
Gera then had to play a long game to deal with the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who had to be carried off the field, and after that Ayr still increased his lead with a touchdown from Stafford McDowall, after Climo turned the corner.
Blair Macpherson, Ayr's captain, then took the yellow jersey and Melrose again used a touchdown from Bruce Colvine to finish the hard-fought attack.
The home team came back strong, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was given the yellow jersey for tackling Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind Ayr's goal, after an extra inning.
Climo turned the attack, as he did again just after the resumption, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick from the wrist and sent to Gregor Henry who scored the team's fifth touchdown.
The star of Game Still is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry.
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, seems ready to move into restaurant management after it emerged that he was hired as CEO of a restaurant company.
Kieran, 56, plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC series Popular, which he writes and stars in alongside his longtime entertainment partner, Creg Hemphill.
The network has announced that the ninth season will likely be the last, and it seems that Kiernan has plans for Craiglang's life.
According to official records, he's the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor would not comment on the news, but a source in the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to become involved in the lively restaurant industry in the city of Glasgow.
The sea is ours: Bolivia's landlocked country hopes the court will reopen the Pacific
Soldiers are guarding the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings are flying the blue flag.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River, shipping lanes are emblazoned with the slogan: "We own the sea".
It's our duty to restore it.
On the other hand, across the landlocked country of Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody conflicts of the 19th century is still fresh in my mind - along with the desire to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes are perhaps the strongest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on October 1 after five years of litigation.
Bolivia has the power, the spirit of unity and the courage, and of course it is waiting for the verdict with a positive attitude,said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the International Court's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia on their demand that Chile be obliged to grant Bolivia access to the sea, after many decades of arduous negotiations.
The ruling on Monday is also very important for Evo Morales, the country's indigenous president who will face a controversial re-election battle next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised in late August.
But some analysts feel it unlikely that the court will rule in Bolivian's favor, and that it would make little difference if it did.
The court, which has its headquarters in the Netherlands, has no authority to grant land from Chile and has ruled that the ruling will not affect the outcome of any possible hearings.
The fact that the court's ruling comes just six months after the final hearings suggested that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Sárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
It is also possible that the last four years have not been a matter of Bolivia's progress, but rather a matter of its regression.
"The current Bolivian government has stolen the issue of access to the sea", Zárate said.
Morales' military rhetoric has drawn all the goodwill from Chile, she felt.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former Bolivian president and representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, rejected the idea that the court's decision took an unusually short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a unique opportunity to open a new relationship with Chile and the chance to end a conflict that stretches back 139 years, to the benefit of both countries, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the issue as a political leverage.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to make up for the past.
North Korea says no denuclearization will happen unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says the country will never dismantle its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri made his speech on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises it made at the Singapore summit of leaders of nations.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume nuclear weapons talks, more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a nightmare that the continued trade embargo and US protests against the declaration of an end to the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington will not accept the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes concrete steps to dismantle its nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the President of the United States, want to meet again at another meeting.
However, there are serious doubts that Pyongyang is serious about disarming what it likely sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris present the latest line of big-headed headdresses that will be coming to fashion stores near you
If you want to expand your collection of hats or be completely hidden from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed off a variety of oversized, curly hats for their SS19 line at the fashion show that roared the rally at Paris Fashion Week.
A number of photos of very sexy hats have been posted on Instagram this summer, and these designers have had their innovative creations showcased at fashion shows.
Valentino's masterpiece was a large light brown hat with wide feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Other accessories to the head included a watermelon set, a gem, a bowler hat, and even a pineapple, but these items are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a number of strange objects, just in time for the hourglass.
Many of the colorful masks had integrated warp and were more like Hannibal Lecter than theatrical.
One mask resembles a carbon monoxide device with a breathing tube and glasses, while the other resembles a melting ice in the form of a loaf of bread.
If you want to be in fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion experts predict that the big hats may soon be on sale in the fashion department stores near you.
Big hats come to the forefront of La Bomba, a gray-haired man with over two-foot-long beards who has graced the heads of everyone from Rihonna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fashion logo on the back of the extremely unconventional hat, seen on all social media, was the inspiration for another large accessory that appeared on the fashion scene  a beach bag made of straw that was almost as big as the swimsuit model wearing it.
An orange bag with a straw and a white leather handle was the centerpiece of the La Riviera SS10 Jacquemus fashion line at Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, the famous people's stylist, said in an interview with FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach tops appear in fashion stores by next summer - where the designer has made such an impact it should be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
The reputation of private schools in Scotland for the outstanding achievements of their pupils has continued in 2018 with new, spectacular test results, further enhanced by individual and group experiences in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
These schools have a total of 30,000 students across Scotland, are run by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), and strive to provide the best possible service to their students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further education, their chosen careers and their status as global citizens.
As a teacher who can create and teach customized curricula, we see that sign language continues to be a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his mind".
If you speak to him in his native language, it touches his heart.
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show that languages are at the top of the list of highest pass rates in private schools.
68 percent of students who studied a foreign language received an A.
The data, collected from 74 schools within SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students received an A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also received an A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will surely need in the future.
At the moment, languages of choice are being equated with science-based subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of private schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that of the reasons employers reported as being difficult to hire, 17 per cent were due to a shortage of people with language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future jobs.
With more and more jobs requiring language skills, this skill is essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career people choose, learning another language will have a real advantage in the future, but it is a skill that lasts a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multifaceted personality an edge over its competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov poll of over 4,000 British adults, 75 percent of them could not speak a second language well enough to carry on a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by the two-digit percentage of the population, or 15 percent.
That is why it is important for children today to invest immediately in language learning.
Multisensing, especially in emerging markets, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, the language used varies from school to school.
A number of schools will focus on more classical languages, while others will teach languages considered to be most important for the UK in the run-up to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child's interests lie, he or she will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specialised teachers.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in a globalized business environment, languages remain essential for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern language should be regarded as a universal language of communication.
Private schools will continue to offer choice, variety and excellence to Scotland's young people.
I must have the fair.
John Edwards is the chairman of the Scottish Private Schools Council
LeBron is making his debut for the San Diego Lakers on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first appearance for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers head coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the season opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
It's not yet decided how many minutes he'll play.
"It's going to be longer than one minute and shorter than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, a commentator for the Lakers, tweeted that James would likely play for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule before the start of the season.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to play games for the season to prepare myself", he said.
Timings for Trump's campaign rally in West Virginia and YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will be holding a series of rallies, the first of which is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He's one of five scheduled meetings next week, where he'll also stop at friendly locations, including in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his choice of a new Supreme Court justice has been put on hold, Trump is reluctant to rally support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of the House when the vote is cast in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally, and how can you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to begin at 7:00 p.m. eastern coast time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the West Virginia meeting with Trump online below via a live YouTube feed.
Trump is likely to preside over the trial of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, where the nation's tension over allegations of sexual assault, the Senate vote to confirm him as a judge, was suspended for up to a week while the FBI investigates the allegations.
But the main purpose of Trump's meetings is to help Republicans get a better handle on the tough November election.
So the message from Trump's campaign was that the five meetings, which will be held next week, are aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters of the firepower the Republicans are trying to protect and increase in their majority in the Senate and the House", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so vital to the president's agenda that he will travel to as many states as possible as the special campaign period begins", an unnamed spokesman for Trump's campaign told Reuters.
Tonight's meeting will be held at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling and is expected to draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by Pittsburgh media, according to the West Virginia Metro News news agency.
Saturday's meeting will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia this month, after winning the state by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump wants to try to help Patrick Morrissey, the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, but he's down in the polls.
"It's not good news for Morrissey that the president has to come and try to increase his popularity", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show a fighting spirit to keep hope alive for the singles on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the quarter-final, which was played on a Saturday afternoon, could be just what was needed in this Ryder Cup competition.
The odds of success is a sporting concept that has been invented and that players believe in so truly, and never more so than in competitions like this.
Where would they say prosperity lies now?
"They were six points ahead and now they are four, so the luck is on our side now, I think", said Jordan Spieth as he started the race today.
Europe, of course, has the lead, four points ahead with 12 more to go.
The Americans, as Spieth said, think they have a little wind in their sails and they can be very proud of a lot of things, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each got three out of four.
Spieth has played the game from the ground up and is leading by example.
The fans' cheering increased as the game went on and he dropped a crucial puck to guard all four points of the game after he and Thomas had been two points down after two games.
His shot, which secured the game on the 15th hole, was accompanied by a cheer, the kind of cheer that tells you he still believes the American team can win.
'You just have to dig deep and think about your own game,' said Spieth.
That's all these players can do right now.
18 holes to score points.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but exciting European pair have won four games out of four and can do nothing wrong.
The Moliwoods were the only couple to have a Saturday afternoon shower, but they also managed to avoid a Saturday morning shower, a Friday afternoon shower, and a nine-hole course on a Friday morning shower.
That game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the loud crowd clearly shows that they are the pair that needs to win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to seal the potential victory of the European team than Fleetwood or Molinari, the sun is setting over Le Golf National Stadium.
The best way would be to do it both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still too early to speak of a victory for the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went lightly with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning foursome, where he played with Alex Noren.
A high-pitched shell and two doubles on the first nine holes plunged the Spaniard and Swede into a hole they never managed to climb out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The foursomes and foursomes are so exciting to watch up close because of the interaction between the couples, their counseling, the advice they don't give, and how the game plan can change in a single instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a big lead going into the final day, but this quarter-final also showed that the American team has the fighting spirit that some people had doubted it had, especially other Americans.
Europe 10-6 ahead of the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good lead for the final day of the Ryder Cup after the four-ball and four-ball Saturday, with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The star-studded Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offense with two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods, and have picked up four points at Le Golf National.
European team Thomas Bjorn, eager to recapture the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, showed a big advantage over the USA team in this morning's foursome, winning 3-1.
The United States showed more resistance in the quarterfinals, winning two games, but failed to win the title.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from 12 singles on Sunday to retain the Cup.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four straight points, and he and Molinari, who shared the nickname "Molliwood" after a spectacular weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the quadruple play, they showed great team spirit and defeated the underdog Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliant mind at odd times, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in the fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was out for the morning foursome, returned to his partner, Henriks Stenson in the foursome, and they won 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are ranked number one and number three on the list of the world's top golfers.
Europe was not all that happy, however, on this mild, sunny day southwest of Paris.
Triple champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American record with two points on Saturday.
They won 2-1 against Jon Rahm of Spain and Ian Poulter in a four-ball match and later came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the four-ball match after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup have teams won by four points at the start of an individual event, though Fury's team needed only a tie to retain the Cup.
After two days of second best, however, a Sunday attack seems to be too much for them.
North Korea says unilateral disarmament is 'impossible' without a deal
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the continued trade embargo only reflected their distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for the country to unilaterally dismantle its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly's annual general assembly that North Korea had taken "significant acts of goodwill" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and promising to stop developing nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we have not seen any corresponding reaction from the US", he said.
Without trust in the United States, there is no guarantee of the security of our country, and under such circumstances, it is impossible for us to unilaterally dismantle our nuclear weapons first.
Although Ri reiterated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to nuclear disarmament in which North Korea would be rewarded for every step it took, his statement seemed peculiar in that he did not explicitly deny unilateral nuclear disarmament as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statements made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the current US president and the North Korean leader, in Singapore on June 12, where Kim called for the "denuclearization" of the Korean Peninsula and Trump pledged to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea has sought a way to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also responded to calls to ease a string of trade sanctions against North Korea.
The US demands that nuclear disarmament take place first, and increase pressure by using trade bans to gain an advantage, and even protesting the declaration of an end to the war, said Ri.
It's just the fantasies of people who don't know anything about us that think a customer scandal can bring us to our knees.
But the problem is that the continued trade embargo is adding to our distrust.
Ri made no mention of plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump, which the US leader spoke about at the UN earlier this week.
The Secretary instead spoke about three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-In in the last five months and added: "If the party to this nuclear disarmament treaty was South Korea instead of the United States, this would not be the standout in the nuclear disarmament issue on the Korean Peninsula".
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from his speech last year when he told the US General Assembly that it was inevitable to target missiles from North Korea at the US mainland after President Trump's "devilish" speech calling Kim a "suicide bomber".
Last year, Trump threatened to "eliminate" North Korea, but this year he praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but said there was still much work to be done and that trade bans would remain in place until North Korea had eliminated all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeline on this and said, "Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council's ban on trade must remain in place until complete nuclear disarmament has been achieved and confirmed".
The Security Council unanimously agreed to increase the trade embargo on North Korea from 2006 in an attempt to cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that he had achieved success, but just hours later North Korea condemned him for making "unreasonable demands".
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to take down its missile sites and nuclear facilities if the United States intervenes in a sustained manner.
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take classes with plenty of rest
A new program at Harvard University has increased the amount of sleep all students get in an effort to counteract the increasing tendency of students to stay up and study through the night with the help of caffeine.
A recent study revealed that students at the world's finest universities often have little or no knowledge of the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course and believes it to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the class after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on academic performance.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and asked, "Why am I being told this only now, in my senior year?"
She said that no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", he told the Telegraph.
The course, held for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help with academic and athletic performance and even contribute to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the school's health care program, said that the university decided to introduce the program after finding that students were very sleepy during the week.
The course is an hour long and includes a variety of hands-on activities.
One section shows a room in a residence hall, where students are smoking coffee cups, window blinds, gym shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance can deteriorate with lack of sleep, along with the importance of a good sleep routine.
In another part, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school district with interactive symbols then encourages participants to reflect on their daily habits.
We know that this is not going to change the behavior of the students in an instant.
But we feel that they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes", added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of staying up all night studying still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increased pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate quality sleep should be the students' "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid gaining weight, since sleep deprivation increases the brain's demand for food so that the body is unable to function.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old graduate student in physics from Caltech, helped Professor Czeisler put the course together, but he sat in on one of the professor's courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the study had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a class for all students in the school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all master's students to complete a similar course before entering university.
Professor Czeisler advised that students consider setting an alarm clock, which reminds them to go to sleep, and to wake them up, and keep in mind the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic displays and LED lights, which can disrupt the body's internal clock and cause trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: mark from the menage shoot down Gerrard's men
The Rangers still struggled on the outfield as a fragmented Stevens Gerrard team had to settle for a 1-0 loss to Livingston, after a goal from Dolly Menga.
Ibrox were looking for their first away win after their defeat at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard only his second defeat in his 18 games as manager, eight points behind Hearts, who are top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
The injury scored seven minutes into the half and the Rangers team seemed to lack all inspiration and was never likely to recover.
The Rangers now drop down to sixth place, while Livingston moves up to third, trailing only Hibernian in goalscoring.
The Rangers could be in for more trouble after linebacker Calum Spence had to be operated on for a head injury after an object was thrown at him from the visitors' goalkeeper.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that knocked Ayr out and reached the quarter-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, however, stuck to the same Levi 11 lineup that reached the stage of Hearts last week and he would have been pleased with how well-trained his teammates overcame the challenge.
The Rangers may have had more of the ball, but Livingston created more chances with the ball that it caught.
They should have scored just two minutes into the game when the first pitch from Menga brought Scott Pitman ahead of Allan McGregor's goal, but he missed.
A long extra shot from Keaghan Jacobs then ended up with Craig Halkett, but Alan Lithgow, his defensive partner, shot past the goal line.
The Rangers regained control of the game but seemed to be living in hope rather than faith in their game in the final quarter of the game.
Alfredo Morales certainly felt that he should have been awarded the game at the end of the quarter, when he and Steven Lawless were paired together, but the referee Steven Thomson dismissed the call of the Colombian.
Rangers managed to take only two shots from goal in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to lose by defending a shot from Lassana Coulibaly and an easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's chances in the 34th minute came despite the other team having the lead, no one can deny that they deserved it, if only because of their bravery.
The Rangers again failed to make anything of a long extra run from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who held his composure and chose to send to Menga, who then scored easily.
Gerrard took his advice in the half and sent Ryan Kent in for Coulibaly and the switch took effect almost instantly as the fullback entered Morelos, but Kelly broke a fast and ran forward to close the shot.
Livingston, however, continued to entice the guests to play the very type of game they enjoyed playing, and Lithgow and Halkett each caught a long delivery on the other foot.
Holts' team could have increased their lead in the final minutes, but McGregor was good at denying Jacobs a chance before Lithgow ran the goal from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, the Rangers' quarterback, wanted to get another extension as he and Jacobs fell together down, but Thomson rejected it again.
Almanak: The man who invented the Geiger counter
Here is a page from our calendar Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and FAM... this is the day that futurist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, and that invention eventually led to a device called the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has gained a firm foothold in the scientific world since then, but was also popular in popular culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in unlikely roles as scientists:
Man: What the hell is this?
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive material besides uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effect of the atoms in the rocks.
Evans: "It's really needed now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer drug can teach the immune system to detect dangerous cells
A new anti-cancer drug can teach the immune system to detect and kill harmful cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of the treatment
The treatment involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them in a laboratory
They can then detect a protein that is common in many cancer cells and inject it back into the patient
Experimental vaccines have shown positive results in patients suffering from various types of cancer.
One woman who received the vaccine had ovarian cancer gone for more than 18 months.
The process involves taking immune cells from a patient and transforming them in a laboratory so that they can detect a protein called HER2 that is found in many types of cancer, and then injecting the cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our findings suggest that the vaccine is highly effective".
HER2 stops the growth of various cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and thyroid and endometrial cancers, Professor Berzofsky said.
A similar technique of extracting immune cells from patients and teaching them to attack cancer cells has worked with a type of white blood cell.
Kanye West gave a long speech in support of Trump and wore a MAGA derhuge after appearing on the television show SNL.
It Did Not End Well
Around the world, Kanye West was attacked in the studio of Saturday Night Live after a lengthy speech in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, where he wore the Make America Great derby hat, he spoke out at length against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I've talked to so many white people who say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
If I were worried about racial hatred, I would have left the United States long ago", he said.
SNL opened with a clip in which Hollywood star Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment.
Although West's video was not aired, a video of it was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear that Rock wanted to make fun of West by releasing the recording.
West had also complained to the audience that he had received poor reception backstage due to his hat-picking.
I was put in a back-row unit.
They said to me, "Don't go up to the stage with that stupid thing".
They put me in the brig!
"Then they say I'm in a deep hole", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on: "Do you want to see the deep hole?" and said he would put on his superhero costume because it means you can't tell me what to do.
Taste the love.
His comments were met with boos from viewers at least twice, and the SNL cast seemed the most embarrassed, according to Variety, with one attendee telling the newspaper: "There was a stunning silence in the studio".
West had been asked to appear on the show to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his stage performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was endorsed by Candace Turner, the chair of the conservative TPUSA party, but she tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: THANKS FOR YOUR BIG BIG RESPONSE".
But chat show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply being himself and that's absolutely wonderful.
 But I chose to NOT reward anyone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their art) that I feel I support and spread an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are too", she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "the man who used to be known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to swap his name and feet in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and not to be forgotten is the music legend Prince, who changed his name to a sign and later called himself the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder following a stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Tuesday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecution will dismiss the charges.
Kit Harington, the star of The Crown, criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor, however, has criticized the male hero stereotype, saying that such roles on screen often make young boys feel they have to be tough to earn respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt something had gone wrong and wondered how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his "The Hunger Games" co-star, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had "strong opinions" on how to handle the issue.
 Personally, I feel at this moment - what has gone wrong with masculinity?
What have we taught men in their upbringing about the problems we see today?
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity, because of the overly masculine characters on television.
He went on to say: "What is innate and what is learned?
What is taught on television and out on the streets that makes young boys feel as if they must be ruled by a man?
I think that's one of the most important questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because it is obvious that something has gone wrong with the young men.
He also admitted in the interview that he would not be appearing in any other Crunchyroll episodes after the series ended next summer, saying that he had been "swallowed up by the fortress and the horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of True West, a film by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother who is a robber.
The actor recently said that the best thing about being in the Crown was meeting his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife on this show, so they gave me some way to my future family and my life after that", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Jon Snow, who was played by Kit in this Emmy Award-winning series.
Parið married in June 2018, in the family's homeland of Lesliar in Scotland.
China reports a 14% increase in new HIV infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people in the country who are infected with HIV or who are living with measles.
Health officials say that over 820,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new infections were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
A large percentage of new infections are transmitted by sexual contact, a change from the past.
Earlier, HIV spread rapidly in parts of China through donations of infected blood.
In contrast, the number of people infected with HIV through this method has dropped to almost zero, according to Chinese health officials speaking at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people infected with HIV or who are infected with HIV has increased by about 100,000 people year over year.
Sexually transmitted HIV infection is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but there is still widespread discrimination against LGBT people.
Because of the country's strict laws, studies estimate that 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many infections result from inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked data from Republican senators, criticizing "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her staff members had posted the personal information of three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said these allegations came from "extreme right-wing" activists and websites.
"Lies, lies and more vicious lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by an unknown party on Capitol Hill during Senate hearings of Supreme Court-appointed Justice Brett Kavanaugh over allegations of sexual harassment.
The game came at some point after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
The Web sites Gateway Pundit and RedState said that the IP addresses that identified the source of the information connected to Waters' office and published information about one of its employees, according to information from Capitol Hill.
"This unproven allegation is completely false and a lie", Waters continued.
My employer - whose personal data and security are now at risk because of these false accusations - was in no way responsible for this information leak.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a lie.
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including by former White House press secretary Ara Fleischer.
"This rejection is full of anger", Fleischer wrote.
That suggests she's not fit to sit on the throne.
When someone is unjustly accused, it is not right to react angrily.
There is no room for resistance.
The accuser's motives cannot be questioned.
It must show calm and composure.
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters' response to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics said appeared to be overly angry at Thursday's trial.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate against Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"A great thing if it is true", he said.
In her statement, Waters said her office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement of these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the other suspects are found", she continued, "and that they are held accountable for all actions that are shameful and dangerous to all my employees".
The film review for Johnny English Strikes Again - spy film with Rowan Atkinson proves powerful
It's become a commonplace now to look for Brexit references in any new film where Britain is involved, and that seems to be the case in this revival of the Johnny English comedy series - which started in 2003 with the film Johnny English and just came back to life in 2011 with the film Johnny English Reborn.
Will this canny satirist about how obviously evil we are be a new export for this country?
Whether or not this is the case, the flamboyant, grumpy, and clownish Johnny English has been given a second renewed license to fuck up - his name indicating above all that he is a creation designed for display in non-English speaking countries.
He's obviously the clever detective who pretends to live off of a thrilling character, but is a little bit of a mix of Clouseau, a dash of Mr. Bean and a little bit of the man who played one note for the song Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is also based on the original traveler and enigmatic world citizen that Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, in which he threw everything at himself in disarray.
There's one or two good things about this latest Johnny English movie.
I liked to see Johnny English walk to the helicopter wearing a medieval brooch and the helicopter leaves peeking into his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his comedic ability, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superficial, especially now that more serious films such as James Bond and the Mission Impossible films also offer a hint of comedy.
The joke seems more for children than for adults, and I found the adventures that Johnny English went on not as thoughtful and focused as the silent comedy of Atkinson's Mr. Beans.
The permanent premise of the film is that Britain is in big trouble.
A hacker has broken into Britain's secret spy network and revealed the identities of every British spy, much to the delight of the spy in charge - but Kevin Eldon unfortunately plays too small a role.
This is the final story for the Prime Minister who is a haughty and controversial character and already in great danger due to massive political unrest: Emma Thompson does her best with her character that is supposed to resemble Theresa May, but the script doesn't catch many fish for her.
Her advisers tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who was already in the dark.
And then there's Johnny English himself, now the headmaster of some fancy school, but also giving secret lessons in how to be a spy: here are some funny jokes English is offering at a spy school that reminds of the movie School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets Bough, his long-tired former partner, who is played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine captain, but in that energetic role, Vicki Pepperdine can't quite make her light shine.
The light-skinned man who has been messing everything up in Her Majesty's service has now returned to the limelight and meets the High Lady Opheliu Bulletovu, played by Olgu Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dazzled by the magic of the glamorous billionaire in the tech industry, who is said to be able to solve Britain's computer problem: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their spree: they light a fine French restaurant with a dozen waiters, they cause trouble while they sneak into Volta's luxury suite, and English turns the whole thing upside down when he tries to use a virtual reality camera to introduce himself inside Volta's house.
There is no saving in that final scene, but while the picture is lively and energetic, there is some childishness in the whole.
It's a medium-sized piece of equipment.
And just like with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is creating a four-day working week for the British, with the same pay as for the five-day week.
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week, but be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants to let business executives use the savings from the AI revolution, and workers benefit from an extra day off.
This would allow workers to enjoy three days of long weekends without a reduction in pay.
Sources say the idea would fit with the party's economic agenda and its policy of improving the welfare of workers.
The Trades Union Congress has supported the reduction of the working week to four days, allowing workers to take advantage of changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party official told the Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
The change will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits with the party's approach to transforming the economy in favour of workers and with the party's overall economic policy.
Labour would not be the first party to support this idea, but the Green Party promised a four-day working week in their 2017 election campaign.
The aim is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole, however.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: The four-day workweek is not on the party's platform and the party is not considering introducing it.
John McDonnell, the Shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, used the Labour Party conference last week to articulate his ideas of social revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back control from the notorious CEOs and lobbyists of the cannabis companies.
The Shadow Minister's plans also mean that existing shareholders in water companies may not get their full share back, as the Labour government could take a 'depreciation' for misconduct.
He has also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create a joint-stock fund to give 10 percent of the assets of private companies to their employees, who could receive £500 a year in dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 Minutes" is about whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a week of controversy in the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination, raising the question of whether its findings could get Senate Republicans to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be aired Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter for 60 Minutes, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
I said when the trial started, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges were laid and asked, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, steadfast, unwavering.
Graham's vote, however, seems irrefutable.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take an incredible amount of criticism to change that", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it firmly", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And no one she named could confirm it.
This case is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new coming.
What is the International Day of Cities, and has it done anything to alleviate poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival is taking place on Saturday in New York City, an annual music event where a host of big stars will be performing with similarly powerful policies to end poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year of the International Urban Festival, and tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park, not just to hear musical performances by the likes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the festival's realistic goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Cities Festival, which was first held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project, a global campaign that aims to end poverty by increasing the number of people who fight it.
To get free tickets to the event (except for those who want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete various tasks, or "activities", such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, making a phone call, or using other valid means to help raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But how well has the festival been accomplished, now 12 years on from its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts really a way to convince people to call for action, or is it just another so-called "smiling" strategy - where people feel they are doing something meaningful by signing up to a petition or posting a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded over 19 million actions by its supporters, calling for a wide range of different causes.
It says these actions have helped to get world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to over $35 billion that will affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of 2018, the group counted 390 commitments and announcements as a result of its actions, out of which at least $10 billion has been invested or raised.
The group estimates that the funds raised have so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One major commitment came from The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based group of investors and executives dedicated to "helping children enjoy themselves to the fullest", who pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end the country's malnutrition crisis, after receiving 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, governments around the world and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of poverty a thing of the past", said Tracey Ullmann, spokesperson for The Power of Nutrition, to an audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 messages were sent out that the UK should improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
Among the list of frequently asked questions on the group's website, one question is: "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult task - sometimes we will fail in the end.
But we will reach our limits, just like the movements that fought for civil rights and the abolition of racial segregation before us, because we are stronger together.
Among the performers at this year's event are Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe. The event will be held in New York City and will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy as 'hindran' to block Russian energy exports, says Home Secretary
"If necessary, Washington could use the navy to prevent Russia from gaining access to markets, including the Middle East", US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's assistance to Syria, especially as the country works at the behest of the legitimate government there, was a prerequisite for exploring new markets.
"I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is that they want to trade in energy like Eastern Europe and Southern Europe", he is reported to have said.
And, according to the official announcement, there are ways and means to counteract it.
The United States can use the navy to ensure that the waterways are open and to form a barrier, if necessary, to ensure that energy from them does not reach the market, he said.
Zinke addressed the guests at a meeting hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charitable organization that calls itself the network of energy consumers in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran and said it was more or less the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is to use energy resources more and less and to exchange them for others", he said, adding that Russia has only one key in mind with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The announcement comes as the Trump administration is looking to increase its natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia as a much cheaper alternative for European consumers.
To do this, officials in the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to get Germany to stop participating in the controversial Nord Stream 2 project to build a new energy pipeline, which Trump says would make Berlin a "catch" for Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the current pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Russians say that Washington's strong opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
'I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for coercion and that consumers should have a choice in their choice,' said Alexander Novak, Russia's energy minister, after meeting Rick Perry, the US energy secretary, in Moscow in September.
The US position has been criticized by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industrial union of Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to abandon the EU's policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
'I am very much against foreign countries trading our energy supply,' said Dieter Kempf, chairman of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, she says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would seriously consider running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that she would be considering running for mayor in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our government, and then we need a woman to lead it", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump at the meeting and said he was taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been vocal in his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his appointee to the Supreme Court.
On Friday, Warren tweeted that "of course we have to get the FBI to look into this before the vote".
A poll released Thursday, however, shows that a majority of voters in Warren County don't think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of likely voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll published by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent said they supported her initiative.
The poll showed more support for the candidacy of Deval Patrick, the former governor, with 38 percent saying they supported his possible candidacy and 48 percent saying they opposed it.
Other popular Democrats who were discussed for possible 2020 presidential nominations included former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make his decision public in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin speaks about the impact of the Palin Trail on the campaign of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year after joining the Army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"My son is going through a lot of hardship after coming back, I feel for other families who are suffering the effects of the devastation and the emotional wounds that our soldiers bring home", she told an audience at Donald Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room", and said that her son and other war heroes "come back a little different, they're hardened, and they wonder if there's any respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen and other branches of the military have done for the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, attempting to obstruct a report of domestic violence, and armed robbery while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Washington D.C. support the challenge against the new universal suffrage policy.
Eighteen states and Washington, D.C. are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang or domestic violence who flee.
Representatives from 18 states and the city filed a court filing Friday in Washington in support of asylum seekers who are protesting the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal agency has not been released.
She said that her husband and his violent gang-member sons had abused her, but U.S. government officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was taken into custody in Texas.
The German defendants, who support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries where gang-related problems and domestic violence are increasing, and many asylum seekers come to the United States from these countries.
The new asylum policy reverses a 2014 ruling by the Immigration Appeals Board to allow undocumented immigrants fleeing persecution to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the Washington secretary of state, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "shredded decades of federal and international laws".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates that rule", the court brief stated.
Lawyers further stated in the report that a policy of denying immigrants entry was harmful to the U.S. economy, arguing that immigrants were more likely to start businesses and "create a vital workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic and gang violence in June.
"Those who leave their home countries because of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion can apply for asylum", Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
The idea of a health-care system was never intended to solve all the problems, even the most serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in the race to find survivors in Palu, the number of dead has doubled
The situation for the survivors will be even more difficult.
"There is a lot of tension in the air", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her sick son at the relief center in the city of Palu.
Ambulances keep bringing in bodies.
There's little about clean water.
The inhabitants returned to their devastated homes and searched their belongings to try to salvage whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals were overwhelmed and damaged by the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Hari, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, were lying outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were being evacuated because of the continuing strong aftershock.
Tears filled his eyes as he told how he felt the earthquake shake his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
"I pushed up the walls, I think", Haris told the Associated Press, saying his family had been in town to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe.
The US Ambassador accuses China of prosecuting the country with anti-terrorist propaganda
A week after China's official newspaper published four advertisements in a U.S. newspaper to discuss the mutual benefits of trade between the two countries, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday spoke out against an ad by a Chinese newspaper in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest newspaper, accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was seeking to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters news agency as a new step in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is natural for foreign governments to issue declarations to encourage trade, Beijing and Washington are locked in an ongoing trade war, with new tariffs on imports from both countries.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China's retaliatory dollars early in the trade war were designed to hurt exporters in states like Iowa, which have shunned Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, which ships a lot of its agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad said in his inside opinion piece in the Des Moines Register Sunday that "China is now adding to its persecution by publishing propaganda in our own free media".
"By expanding its advertising, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's cherished freedom of speech and our free press by running an expensive advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad said in his article.
"Once again, few protests can be found in the newspaper stands on the streets of Beijing, and no true reflection can be found on the differing views that Chinese people may have on China's worrisome economic policies, with the media being trapped under the heel of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that one of the largest newspapers in China had declined an offer to publish his article, but he did not specify which newspaper.
Experts warn that Republicans are distracting female voters from the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned of a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections, because many Republicans have backed and defended Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who has filed sexual harassment allegations.
There's been a lot of strong sentiment around this issue and most Republicans have already publicly indicated they want to start the ballot.
"You can't get away with these things", Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that the last-minute call by Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake for an FBI investigation will be enough to anger voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, general counsel and spokeswoman for the liberal group MoveOn, on Friday, according to the Washington D.C. news outlet.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is approaching!" as they protested at the Senate floor when the Republicans who controlled the Senate Judiciary Committee decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and passion of voters will go up from the top", Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst, told the news website.
People will say that the interest was already high, and that's true.
But it could be higher, especially among women voters in rural areas and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who like the president badly, but vote less.
Analysts predicted a setback if the Republicans pushed to confirm Kavanaugh, even for Ford's testimony in which she described her accusations of sexual harassment from him.
"This is a big mistake for the Republican Party", former Republican National Committee member Michael Still said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets to sit on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her", Guy Cecil, chairman of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the Post.
However, the Americans seem to be divided on who to believe, after the testimony of both Ford and Kavanaugh, and with a majority supporting the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents said they "certainly or probably" believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they "certainly or probably" believe Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said they believed Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's call, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other woman, Deboruh Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her when she was 17 and that he was under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says Kavanaugh carried his penis in front of her when they were both at a Yale University student party in the 1990s.
The man who invented the Internet has plans to start a new Internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the Internet, is going to start a startup company to compete against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech giant, Inrupt, is a company built on Solid, Berners-Lee's open source project.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access what information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said that the purpose behind Inrupt was "global conspiracy".
"We have to do this now", he said of the shoe business.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own personal online data store, or POD.
It may contain a list of contacts, to-do lists, a calendar, music memories, and other personal and work-related devices.
It's like having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all in one place in your browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal data store is that it's completely up to the user who can access what information.
The company calls it "personal data privacy".
According to John Bruce, the company's CEO, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company provides the resources, processes and relevant knowledge to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Today, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security contractor who was bought by IBM, several programmers who were hired as developers to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers around the world could build their own standalone apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team would not be talking to Facebook and Google about whether to launch a complete overhaul that would overturn their current business model overnight.
We don't ask their permission.
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published on Medium on Saturday that Inrupt had set out to create a business and ecosystem power that would help protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on SolidWorks.
Berners-Lee revolutionized the Web in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past few months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate over the impartiality of the web.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even as he comes to Inrupt's feet.
"I am very optimistic about the next era of the Internet", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest and recipient of the Victoria Cross from the First World War honored
The only English priest to be honoured with the Victoria Cross as a soldier in the First World War has been buried in his home town 100 years later.
Séra Bernard Vann, a lieutenant colonel in the army, was awarded the Cross on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, and he was never told that he had received the highest honor of the British Army.
Two of his victims unveiled a memorial to him at a screw-in in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "wonderfully symbolic" that the monument had been unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's death.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the First Army Sub-Commander led his troops across the Canal de Saint-Quentin through a thick fog and under heavy fire from parachutes and machine guns.
Then he ran to the line of fire and, with great courage, led the line forward before attacking the parachute of one of his squad and overpowering three soldiers.
The vice-admiral was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's heroics were "something I could never do, but something that makes you humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the procession, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was "very honoured to be part of the procession" and added that "the courage of true heroes is shown by the support of so many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they got to see the greyhound.
Just imagine, having to stay up all night to see the overcrowded Bellator 206, only to be denied the main event.
The schedule included 13 fights from San Jose, six of which were on the main screen and were shown live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for their fight, British viewers were taken by surprise when the broadcast was changed to Grey.
Some were unhappy after staying up all night to watch the battle.
One Twitter fan described the change in the children's theme as "a sick joke of sorts".
"According to official rules, the material was not suitable for viewers at 6 a.m. so they had to switch to children's material", Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator, said when asked about the broadcast.
Good pig, yeah.
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said they would be reviewing their schedules and taking UK viewers into account in the future.
"I think when I think about the review that we could probably sort out this", Coker said.
But it's 6 a.m. on a Sunday morning there, and we can't solve this until Sunday, our time, which is Monday for them.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was being exchanged, there were a lot of text messages going back and forth, and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a public problem.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We're limiting the night to five fights instead of the usual six, but we tried too hard and we outdid ourselves.
This is an unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley found guilty of sexual abuse
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says that his sexual orientation caused him to feel disrespect for others as a child, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old Daley said he didn't realize he was different from other people until he went to art school.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said he spoke about gay rights to give others a "show".
He also said that parenting had taken away his interest in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular program coordinator, has taken a few months off because of illness.
Daley appeared on Laverne's first episode and said that he felt like he was a lesser man than everyone else when he was a child because "it was not accepted in society to be liked by both boys and girls".
He said: "To this day, those feelings of being different and of being different have given me the strength and the power to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was somebody, he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint anyone when the truth came out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has made a name for himself as an LGBT advocate, and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more nations to legalize same-sex marriage.
He said he was happy to live openly without punishment and wanted to give others "the benefit of the doubt".
The three-time world champion said it came as a surprise to him to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he is, last year, but said the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - after participating in his first Olympics at age 14 and losing his father to cancer three years later - he said that it would be hard to find a peer who had experienced similar success and hardship.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his views on life had all but collapsed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would have been all about winning a gold medal", he said.
You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not come to terms with the fact that he was going to die, and one of the last things he had asked was if they had finished their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't live long enough to sit in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until his breathing stopped and he was dead that I finally admitted that he wasn't invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics, winning a bronze medal.
"I just knew that I had dreamed of this all my life, to dive in front of the spectators in the Olympic Stadium.
It was also the inspiration for the choice of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had given him inspiration for the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 British time.
Mickelson in poor shape and left sitting on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he needs to find his old rhythm again so that the record is not surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who is playing in the tournament for the 12th time, which is a record, was left on the bench following the decision of forward Jim Furyk for the four-ball and four-ball matches on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the controversy, as has been so often the case in the United States, the five-time champion's day is divided between being a cheerleader and practicing his moves on the field, hoping to correct his faults.
Mickelson, 48 years old, was never the one who shot the killer, and is not the best player for Le Golf National golf course, where long-arm misses often result in bad shots.
And not only is the course a challenge in itself, Mickelson will face Frances Molinari, the British Open winner, in the ninth match on Sunday, with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, who has won all four of his matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points down, take the first game of 12 singles, get a good start, Mickelson's game could be a turning point.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he could hardly say much more.
"He understood perfectly the role he had today, patted me on the back and took me in his arms and said he would be ready tomorrow", said Furyk.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's been such a big asset to the teams before and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I had a lot more in mind, but that's how it ended up, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everybody else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never been matched by another record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, but Furyk said his absence had a certain uncertain impact on the team.
"He's funny, he's cool, he's friendly, he likes to make fun of people and it's great to have him in the team room", he explained.
I think the younger players enjoyed playing against him this week, too, and it was fun to watch.
He's so much more than just a golf player.
Thomas Bjorn, the European Commissioner, knows that a big advantage can be lost quickly
European skipper Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a good lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
The Danish made his debut in Valderrama in 1997, where the team led by forward Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but managed to claim victory in the final by the smallest possible margin, with a 141⁄2-131⁄2 victory.
"You always remember that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama where we won, but only right", said Bjorn, pictured here, after watching the 2018 season win 5-3 both Friday and Saturday and reach the 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
History will show me and everyone on this team that this is not over.
We're all going to work hard tomorrow.
Let's go and make this right.
It's not over until all the points are on the board.
We have our goal and that's trying to win this cup, we're focused on that
I've always said this, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we're very aware of our opponents on the other team - the best golfers in the world.
Bjorn was very pleased with the way his players had handled the difficult pitch, adding: "I never outdo myself in this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow it's the performance of individuals that counts, and that's another thing.
It's great to play with a partner when everything is going well, but when you play alone, it's a test of your golf skills.
That's the message that you need to send to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind and he's got to play his best game himself.
Unlike Bjorn, his manager Jim Furyk found that his players performed better in singles than in doubles, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four.
Furyk has experienced both sides of this great transformation himself in the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline but ended up losing when Europe performed the "Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every fucking word", he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 champion, had encouraged his players for the final day.
We have 12 big games to play tomorrow, but you want to start as fast as we did in Brooklyn and Medinah.
When the muscle is near erection, it puts great pressure on the muscles in the center.
We'll rank our players accordingly and let them play the way we think will be best tomorrow.
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defense and will play against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the games.
"I chose these players in this order because I think they cover all the way through", said Bjorn about his selection of players in the individual competition.
A New German Battleship Delayed Again
The German Navy's newest warship was supposed to be built in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be ready until at least next year due to faulty systems and ever-increasing costs, according to local news.
Construction of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class of luxury ships, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a spokesman for the navy who spoke to Die Zeit.
The ship was scheduled to be delivered to the Navy in 2014, but serious post-delivery problems plagued the project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the navy in 2007 are to replace the aging Bremen-class battleships.
They must be equipped with powerful parachute guns, multiple air and naval fire engines, and stealth technology, along with reduced radar and sonar.
Other important features are longer service life - the latest ships should be able to be used for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, the constant waves mean that these state-of-the-art ships - which are said to enable Germany to show its strength at sea - will be obsolete when they are finally taken into service, says Die Zeit.
The F125 battleship made headlines last year when the German Army officially refused to accept the flag and returned it to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the dismissal, but the German press reported that many women had serious "software and mechanical problems" that rendered the ship useless if it were to be sent to war.
The software gauges were especially important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class battleship will be manned by a crew of 120 men, less than half the number of the Bremen-class battleships.
It was also discovered that the ship was becoming too heavy, which impaired its performance and limited the navy's ability to make future repairs.
The 7,000-tonne ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as a similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the hardware failure, the cost of the whole project - including the training of the airport - is starting to cause problems.
It is said to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), but originally it was supposed to be €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the new ships are particularly significant in view of the warning that German operations at sea are dwindling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was becoming a "submarine with a task force".
The official said that the problem had been solved over time, since older ships were being retired and no replacements were being built.
He resented the fact that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships could be taken into naval service.
National Trust for the Protection of Nature spy on the secret life of the leather-padded
A new study of the Scottish Highlands, Scotland, aims to find out how the leatherback bats use the landscape for foraging.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behavior of these solitary flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study, led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will examine different types of leather blocks in the Inverewe Estate in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations around the area to monitor the behaviour of the leatherback flies over the period.
NHS staff and volunteers will also be on handheld sensors.
Experts will analyze all the recordings to find out the frequency of calls, what the leather blocks are saying, and which species are doing what.
Habitat maps and reports will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour on a geographical scale.
Rob Dewar, a night-life consultant for NTS, hopes the findings will shed light on the habitats most important to the leatherback and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the costs of habitat management, such as creating forests and how best to maintain forest land for leatherback turtles and other related species.
Leather blocks have declined dramatically over the last century in Scotland and throughout Britain.
They are threatened by construction and development projects that affect their numbers and diminish their habitat.
Wind turbines and lights can also pose risks, as can flying paper and certain materials used in construction, as well as attacks by house cats.
Lead blocks are not really blind.
However, their ears are much more effective than their eyes when it comes to hunting by day, since they are accustomed to hunting at night.
They use sophisticated meteorological techniques to locate insects and other objects in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes mud blocks very seriously.
The organizations are staffed by ten experts who regularly conduct inspections, surveys, and sometimes rescue operations.
The Association has even established Scotland's first and only leatherback country at Threave Farm in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten leatherback species.
According to David Thompson, the park's superintendent, it is a perfect territory for them.
"The area here at Threave is great for leather blocks", he said.
We have old buildings, plenty of mature trees, and plenty of good housing.
But there is still a lot of uncertainty about leather blocks, so the work we are doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to clean up.
He stressed the importance of checking the leather blocks before any maintenance is carried out on the equipment, as a possible accidental destruction of one nest can kill up to 400 female leather blocks and young and contaminate all leather blocks in the area.
Leatherbacks are protected and it is forbidden to kill, harm or disturb them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about leather blocks, and we don't know how many of them are doing well".
Ronaldo denies the rape allegations. His lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations against him "fake news" and says people want to draw attention to themselves by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is alleged to have paid her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, told his 142 million followers in an Instagram Live video that they were "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do that.
"What we've heard today is fake news", the world champion said five times to the camera.
These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's only natural.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldos' lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "a disgraceful disclosure of a suspicion of privacy", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said Ronaldo would be required to pay "a fine equal to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Attorney's Office in Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her that he was a 99 percent good man who fell into temptation because of 1 percent.
The documents show that Ronaldo agreed to the couple's sexual activity, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga maintains that she went to the police and had her effects photographed in a hospital, but eventually agreed to settle out of court because she was "scared of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
She says she's not going to continue the series because she's still in shock from the incident.
Ronaldo was close to moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged rape took place, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve on a 100 million euro deal.
Brexit: Britain would lose its car makers forever
Britain would regret it forever if it lost its position as global leader among car manufacturers after Brexit, says Trade Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a contract", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of the border loss if no-deal Brexit becomes a reality would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which makes the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European countries.
'My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production ceasing at our plant,' said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive in Burnaston.
Other British carmakers have expressed concern about leaving the EU without agreement on how to conduct business between the countries, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford in a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are what car manufacturers say are the main risks if a no-deal Brexit becomes a reality.
The Toyota production line is based on 'last minute pick-up', with parts delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption to the border, which industry believes could lead to a shortage of supplies.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than day-ahead storage at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU was specifically aimed at preventing these views at the border.
"We need to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that allows us to enjoy not just success in the modern world, but as an opportunity that we can seize", he said on BBC Radio 4.
The evidence, not just from Toyota but from other manufacturers as well, shows that we must be able to continue with very efficient processes.
Toyota could not say how long their production would be halted, but warned that in the longer term the increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a trustee of the factory's workers' union, said that his colleagues are increasingly concerned: 'My experience is that once these jobs are gone, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have drawn up a detailed and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU".
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
The White House announced Sunday that a crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, the assistant attorney general, could be "postponed by a week" as the controversy over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Robert Mueller, the special counsel, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump associates and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
For weeks, there has been speculation in Washington that Trump will fire an assistant U.S. attorney, putting Mueller's independence in jeopardy.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a recording device to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of overthrowing the president using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
But last Monday, he visited the White House, amidst reports that he was considering resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday, but he was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "didn't want to fire" Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who has accused him of sexual assault, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sander, Trump's press secretary, was on the air on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set for him, it could be this week. I think it's possible that he will be postponed for another week because of everything else that's going on at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'm always happy to inform the media.
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the small number of meetings was not due to dissatisfaction with the fact that TV reporters were "spectators", but she did say: "I don't disagree with the fact that they are "spectators".
She then gave hints that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
The President answers more questions from the media than any other President has done before,she said, without citing sources:We have looked at these figures.
Press conferences will still be held, Sanders said, but if the media has a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of that, and you've seen us do a lot of that in the last few weeks, and it's going to replace the media censorship when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with other leaders who visit him.
Media meetings with him alone are rare.
Perhaps the president showed why in New York this week, when he displayed a reckless and at times bizarre demeanor in front of a group of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU healthcare workers in Scotland over Brexit concerns
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working within the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland to express the nation's gratitude and wish it to continue its work after Brexit has been passed.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter already less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to cover the cost of job applications for EU nationals working in the public sector.
In his letter, Mr Freeman wrote: 'During the summer, discussions between the UK and the EU on the issue of failure have continued and a decision is expected in the autumn.
The UK Government has also been preparing for the possibility of no deal.
I know this must be a very uncertain time for all of you.
So I would like to emphasize again how much I appreciate the work of all the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Partners from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and expertise that enhances and improves the work of healthcare and benefits patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is indeed your home and we very much want you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie had to undergo emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to Mike Organ, a reporter for the Tennessean.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred before halftime.
"He got to the sideline and fell down there", Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was put on a gurney and carried out for further evaluation.
Tennessee State rep Chris Harris, a radio personality for WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, said Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there was little information about the nature or severity of the impact yet and that Tennessee State was trying to figure out when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, who is in his senior year, is playing his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five tackles in total on Saturday before he left, bringing his total to 18.
Foreign buyers will be squeezed for higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, with the proceeds going to help the homeless, under the Conservative Party's new plan
The measure will make no difference to Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Increased stamp duty to be imposed on UK tax evaders
The government's budget is £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, with the proceeds going towards helping the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by promising affordable housing and taxing the wealthy.
Individuals and businesses that do not pay UK tax will have to pay higher stamp duty, and the surplus will go to government efforts to help the homeless.
The increase - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the increase that was imposed two years ago on the additional home and the mortgage for rent - could be as high as three percent.
The government estimates that the increase will raise up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of new London homes are bought by foreign buyers, which causes prices to rise and makes it harder for first-time home buyers to enter the market.
Many of the country's more affluent areas - especially the capital - have become ghost towns because of the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in child support to help more young people get their first homes.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged May to end quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain's "housing tax".
Mr Corbyn has announced a number of credible reforms to housing policy, including rent controls and the end of rent-free rents.
He also wants to give the councils more power to build new homes.
Theresa May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate myself to the restoration of the British dream in my first term - that every new generation should enjoy a better quality of life.
And that involves fixing our un-enriched real estate market.
The doors of Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be true that it is as easy for foreigners and companies with headquarters abroad to buy homes as it is for able British citizens.
For many, the dream of a home of their own has become too distant, and the stigma of homelessness is still too real.
Jack Ross: "My main goal is to coach Scotland"
Jack Ross, the Sunderland manager, says that his biggest ambition is to become Scotland manager one day.
The 42-year-old Scot is now enjoying the challenge of breathing new life into the North-East club, which is currently third in the Premier League, three points from the top.
He moved to Sunderland this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I injured my knee and that was the end of it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching a lot of Scotland in Hampden with my dad, as a kid, and it's always something that has drawn me back.
But that opportunity would only come if I was successful in coaching the varsity team.
Ross's previous coaching experience at Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic said he had no qualms about following the footsteps of such big names at such big clubs, having previously turned down coaching positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Even so, I will measure my success by thinking, 'Can I get this club back in the Premier League?
"This club is twice as good at home in the Premier League because of its structure and facilities", he said.
It's not an easy job getting him there, but I'd probably only consider myself a success here if I got the club back up there.
Ross has only three years of coaching experience, after a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third division, and turned St Mirren, who were then relegated, into league champions the following season.
Ross says he is more confident now than he was at any point in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real time trial", he says of the period when he became coach of Alloa.
I really believed that coaching was for me, even more so than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was doing well, making a decent living and enjoying great success.
But change can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of stuff every week.
I still go through the stress and pressure of the job, but coaching just seems right for me.
I always wanted to train and now I do, I've never felt better about myself in all my adult life.

The best time for a beer is 5:30 on a Saturday, according to a poll
This summer's heat wave has proved to be a boon for British bar owners, but it's also put pressure on restaurant chains.
Sales at pubs and children's stores rose 2.7 percent in July, while sales at restaurants fell 4.8 percent, according to the figures.
Peter Martin of business consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "The continued sunshine and England's unexpected success at the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to June, when prices rose 2.8 percent, except that restaurants sold even less.
Sales at restaurants fell by 1.8 percent in June and worsened again in July.
Pubs and bars, which mainly sell liquor, were at their peak with more activity, while restaurants were down.
Food stores also had difficulty in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
The sales of beverages at pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent for the month, while the sales of food decreased by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, from the analyst firm RSM, said: "These results are a continuation of the momentum we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales in out-of-home markets.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups are still struggling, although the 4.8 percent drop in monthly sales is especially painful in the face of continued cost pressures.
This long, hot summer could hardly have come at a worse time for the measurement, and only time will tell whether the tempered temperatures we experienced in August will improve the situation.
The overall increase in sales at pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the pace of the opening.

One in five children have secret social-media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children as young as 11 years of age has secret social network accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 students showed an increase in the number of Instagram accounts
The news has raised concerns about the publication of pornographic material
Twenty percent of students say they have a checking account that they show their parents
One in five children, all the way down to age 11, secretly create social media accounts that they keep from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a huge increase in the number of Instagram accounts - a reference to the website Instagram.
The news media has added to the concern over the publication of sexual material.
Twenty percent of the students reported having a clean checking account to show their parents, as well as having a secret account.
A mother who accessed her 13-year-old daughter's secret Web site found a teenager who encouraged others to rape her.
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC, showed that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 had two accounts, and half of them admitted to having online accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: "It is worrying that so many young people are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the athlete's representative on the Scottish Athletics Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful female athlete and Ian Beattie, chairman of the committee, said the appointment was a great opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from her vast experience on the international stage over the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected within the sporting community in Scotland, the UK and internationally, and we are sure that sport in Scotland would benefit greatly from her being on the committee", said Beattie.
Doyle said: 'I am very interested in speaking on behalf of athletes and hope that I can contribute and help to take the sport forward in Scotland.'
The American, who won four Olympic gold medals in the 200- and 400-meter events at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and is now a regular on the BBC, was paralyzed after suffering a stroke.
He tweeted: One month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I recovered, and how much.
It has been hard work, but I have recovered completely, have learned to walk again, and am doing gymnastics today!
Thank you for your words of encouragement!
Breast-pump ads that compare a cow to a cow are causing controversy online
A company that makes breast pumps is now the subject of an online controversy because of advertisements that feature milking mothers with cows that are milked.
Inspired by music videos, Elvie, a company that produces commercials, is promoting what it says is "the world's first portable breast pump with sound". The commercial is intended to showcase the freedom that the new pump offers pregnant mothers.
Four real mothers dance to a chorus of hooves and songs with the words: "Yes, I'm milking, but you can't see my tail" and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't eggs, they're my breasts".
The process continues: "Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I pump the milk out of the jules".
However, the ad, which appeared on the company's Facebook page, has caused a stir on the Internet.
The video has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and has received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it is a reference to the "shock" that accompanies the milk crisis.
Really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
"Like us, they need to be calf-fed and pregnant to produce milk, except that the calves are taken from them only a few days after they are born", one commentator said.
The Elvie breast pump fits comfortably into the Elvie/Mother breastplate.
Another viewer wrote: "Obviously difficult for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who are allowed to hold their babies?
Another added: "This ad is totally out of date".
Others took notice of the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she found the song "very disturbing".
I think it's a great idea.
I would have bought one of these if I had a baby on my chest.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping milk out of my mouth.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it as it came.
"This is a brilliant idea", wrote one of the audience members.
Another said: 'This is a fun ad targeting mothers who pump milk (often in the workplace or in the bathroom) and feel like a 'mummy.'
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the commercial, the group of women shows that they have all been dancing with the breast pumps folded in their breasts.
The idea behind the campaign is that many women say that they feel like a cow when they pump milk.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires or guides, and fits comfortably on top of the breast holder, giving women freedom to move, hold their baby, and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and manager of Mother, said: "Elvie's pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a spectacular presentation that would make headlines.
By comparing women to cows, we wanted to highlight the breast pump and all its challenges, and show in an even more entertaining and familiar way how much relief a new pump would provide.
This is not the first time that Elvie the pumpkin has been in the news.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared in front of designer Marta Jakubowski, wearing the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved into tent camps along the Texas border
The number of immigrant children in custody has increased dramatically, even though the number of people crossing the border each month has remained relatively stable, in part because the rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration have made it harder to get the children into foster care.
Usually, the foster parents have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and have been afraid to jeopardize their chances of remaining in the country by offering to adopt a child.
The threat was heightened in June, when the government announced that prospective foster parents and other adults in the home would be required to provide fingerprints, and that the records would be shared with the Immigration Service.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before the Elders' Committee that his organization had arrested a number of people who applied to adopt single children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on the list of persons in the system.
 Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or foster parents are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are registered illegal immigrants.
"So we kept looking for those individuals", Mr Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the handling of child cases, deputies announced new rules requiring some children to appear in court within a month of being placed in custody, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to officials working on the cases.
Many of them will appear via videoconference, rather than in person, to argue their legal position before an immigration judge.
Children deemed unfit for entry are deported immediately.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent behavior or attempted escape, according to the staff of the detention center and reports published by the system in recent months.
Spokesmen said that these problems were even more likely in a larger facility like Tornillo, where the likelihood of a child having a problem is negligible because of the number of children.
They added that moving the children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare them spiritually or to say good-bye to friends could add to the trauma that many of them are already experiencing.
Syria says US, French and Turkish "experts" to withdraw as soon as possible
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also said in his speech to the UN General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the country's conflict is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syria under the false pretext that they were fighting against terrorism, and that "they will be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the House.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror was almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territory of both terrorist groups and illegal foreign entities".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of them training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arab fighters fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that conditions were good enough for them to return and he taught some Western countries to "spread unfounded fear" that encouraged refugees to stay away.
'We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return,' he said.
They're making politics out of something that should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funding for reconstruction in Syria unless a political settlement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN experts say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a neutral zone at the last major stronghold of the conflict has created an opportunity for continued political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major offensive by Syrian forces backed by Russia into the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualem emphasised that the agreement had a 'definitive deadline' and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, and that they would be 'eliminated'.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN ambassador, hopes to attend the first meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and opposition, to negotiate a constitution for post-war Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to "overriding the provisions of the current government", and warned against any aggression.
Reasons Trump will win a second term
According to that rationale, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless impeachment and impeachment end his presidency, as many liberal voters would likely hope.
In what would undoubtedly be the most dramatic end to a presidential career ever!
Just like the audience doesn't wear a tri-color.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has topped the ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers on prime time.
"It's a fire that people are drawn to, because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, host of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" about a government employee who becomes president after the U.S. Capitol is bombed.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned humorist and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different view.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The cab driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh", Mrs. Scovell said to me.
There is entertainment value in the mess.
However, unlike what is shown on television, the stories from Washington could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Only the most privileged viewers can afford to stop watching.
And yet, this is more than being an enlightened citizen when you watch the sixth hour of a panel of experts arguing about Bob Woodward's use of "almost" references for his book "Fear", or the $15,000 street-leather jacket that Paul Manafort wore (a look that is lined with pride, the Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's detailed biographical descriptions of Mr. Trump.
At least I'll never look at Super Mario with the same eyes again.
"Part of what he does and makes you feel like it's a reality show is he gives you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the show "Pawn Stars", he discusses the staffing of Trump's show and daily changes to the storyline (e.g. starting a fight with the N.F.L. and praising Kim Jong-Un in the garden).
You can't miss one episode, or you'll lose your TV.
When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss, it was 75 degrees and sunny outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he stayed inside and watched MSNB while he recorded CNN.
He couldn't just shrug it off, not when Brett Kavanaugh was about to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
I remember when we were making all these crazy things in the old days and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out that people were right.

Money outside flows in the most important election of the middle ages
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is seeing a flood of money, thanks to a redistricting that resulted in two representatives running for the same seat.
The newly redrawn Pittsburgh district sends out Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in the second district in a special election last summer.
Lamb is running against another congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now representing the old Pennsylvania's 12th district, which is very much in line with the new 17th district.
The redistricting map was reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old redistricting was in favor of the Republicans and was unconstitutional.
The race for the new 17th district has been a race to fund campaigns between the major funders of both parties, the Democratic Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after his narrow victory in a March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, which was closely followed by many.
Republicans had previously held that seat for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by a 20-point margin.
Political pundits have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its support of China, but then withdrew.
Government insiders noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a secret meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, the President of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until co-owners raided the Trump administration's assembly away.
"Foreign Ministry officials decided to recall the US ambassadors in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions were only contemplated against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million from the United States for aid in 2017, including for drug control, development work and economic support.
The penalties, which included cuts in financial support and restrictions on residency permits, would have been painful for the Central American country, which has high unemployment and high homicide rates.
As the community meetings continued, U.S. and Central American representatives postponed a conference on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting held last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent people from moving to the United States.
But by mid-September, delegates at the top of the ranks made it clear that they wanted the convention to go ahead, and thus all talk of sanctions against El Salvador ended.
Vice President Mike Pence is now referring to the conference, due to take place in mid-October, as a sign of how important it is to the administration, the officials said.
The three American envoys also returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to discuss the discussions described by the three American delegates, including two senators, who agreed to discuss the internal affairs of the country, against the wishes of the anonymity.
Their accounts were corroborated by an outside source working closely with the administration, who also spoke on the matter on condition of anonymity.
Learning the Lesson
The next scandal could be the report by special counsel Roberts Mueller on Mr. Trump's possible actions to impede justice, but that claim is backed by a wealth of official evidence.
It's also been said that Mr. Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on our election.
If Congress is controlled by another party, Trump may have to answer to that, as he prepares to meet his constituents again, and perhaps a jury of his peers.
But it's very uncertain, and I don't want to say that Trump's fall is uncertain, nor is the fall of his colleague in Europe.
We all have a choice, on both sides of the Atlantic, that will affect how long the struggle will last.
In 1938 German advisers were ready to depose Hitler if only the Western powers would give him a counter-attack and support the Czechoslovak people in Munich.
We failed to do so, and we missed an opportunity to avoid the disaster that followed.
The story revolves around such important points and the pace or the reason for the unstable progress of democracy.
Americans are facing some of these critical issues right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the state's attorney, the man who is in control of the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad place since this paper reported that last year he proposed secret taping of the president and discussed whether he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times story is wrong.
How will we respond if the newly launched FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not thorough or fair, or if he is confirmed to the bench by a Supreme Court judge despite religious allegations of sexual harassment and perjury?
And most importantly, will we elect a midterm congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, the republic will have to endure a long winter.
But I think we will not fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother, a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia, was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had previously occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later, she sent me to light a candle on a table with a swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not look to the future with optimism?

Graham Dorrans, a Rangers player, optimistic for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory against the Austrians will put them in a strong position to move up from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first start of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villareal, but he believes Rangers can use the result as a springboard to better their form.
"It was good to get this point for us, because Villarreal is a strong team", said Dorrans, 31.
We started the game believing we could achieve something and ended up taking one step.
We might have been able to claim victory in the end, but overall, the tie was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came in strong in the second half and played better.
Thursday is another big night for the European League.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they did well in their last game, but with the fans supporting us, I'm sure we can overcome this and get a positive result.
Last year was difficult, both because of my injuries and the changes that took place in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling in the place.
It's a good team, the guys are having fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put the last game behind us and succeed.
Women lose sleep over fear of losing their retirement savings
Although survey respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide survey said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they discussed this subject with their children.
"People want a family member to care, but they don't take the right steps to have those conversations", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
That's how it starts.
Talk to your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not make your wishes clear to them with good reason.
Discuss with your counselor and your family where and when you will receive care, as these choices can make a big difference in terms of cost.
Get your financial adviser involved: Your adviser can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are traditional life insurance with long-term care, blended life insurance that pays out in cash to help pay the costs, or self-insurance with your own money - as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Avoid legal disputes in advance
Get a healthcare representative so that you can appoint someone you trust to manage your healthcare and ensure that healthcare professionals take care of your wishes if you cannot express them yourself.
Consider also getting a bookkeeper for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and to see that your bills are paid if you cannot do it yourself.
Remember the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has an emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Could you answer some questions about medication and allergies?
Make sure that you have a written schedule that details your preparation.
"It's not just about the money, it's also about who the doctors are", said Martin.
What are the medicines?
Who's gonna watch the dog?
Have that plan ready.
Man shot multiple times with an aerial gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle while walking home after a night of partying.
The victim is a man in his fifties and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, groin and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred at about 2:30 a.m. local time, as a random act of violence.
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The man was not seriously injured, and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Floods in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a massive earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With all communications down, rescue workers have been unable to provide any information from Donggala County, which is an area north of Palu and lies near the epicenter of the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16,000 people were forced to flee their homes in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the bottom of a narrow strait on the west coast of Sulawesi island.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a prefecture covering more than 380 kilometers of coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
Sislan, an administrative subdivision of the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries in Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is most concentrated in Morowali, on the coast of Sulawesi, on the other side of the island.
According to the Indonesian Maritime Administration, Palu and Donggala have been hit by floods several times in the last century.
In 1938, more than 200 people died when a tsunami struck and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Also, in 1996, a flood in the western part of Donggala killed nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, and earthquakes are a regular occurrence.
Here are the major earthquakes and floods of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra struck on December 26, triggering a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of them die on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale strikes southern Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that kills nearly 700 people on the southern coast.
2009: An earthquake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
Over 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami that rose to 33 feet [10 m] and destroyed many villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: A major earthquake rocked the Pidie Jaya district of Aceh, causing devastation and overpopulation, as people recall the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No floodwaters formed this time, but over 100 lives were lost as buildings collapsed.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded on the island.
The eldest son of Sarah Palin arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on a charge of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence for attempting to prevent a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report by the Alaska State Police released Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin took his friend's phone when she tried to call the police to report an intentional crime.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su station where he is awaiting his sentencing hearing, and is being held on $500 bail, according to a news release from KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared that he was "not guilty", when asked to declare his guilt or innocence, according to the news agency.
Palin is charged with three Class A felonies, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which is punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been accused.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is now before the Alaska Court of Military Appeals.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence, and carrying a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claims he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of insurgents in 2016 after she taught a crash course on her son's violent behavior after his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake, measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami that has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communication systems are down, and we expect the death toll to rise in the next few days.
The quake struck just off the central island of Sulawesi, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Video of the incident is now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the waves hit the beach.
Prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspected terrorist in New York City.
Prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of involvement in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare punishment not used in the state for federal offenses since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is believed to have hired a Home Depot van to attack people on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the will to apply the death penalty, filed in the Southern District Court of New York.
Both of these charges can lead to the possible death penalty, according to court records.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for criminal purposes, which is usually used by prosecutors in charges against organized crime groups.
The attack involved "highly premeditated acts of violence", prosecutors said, describing Sapiov's work as "horrific, cruel, and immoral".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was subjected to physical injury, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last tried a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution was in a New York court case in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court records.
He told the investigating officer that he was fine with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he got the idea for the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked him to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea against life in prison without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of this incident for all concerned", Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutor not to pursue the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage pledged to "make the people's army" at a rally today at the Conservative conference.
This former Ukip leader said politicians should be wary of pressure from EU sceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham protest that Britain would leave now if Mr Farage was the leader of the Brexit party.
But the challenge May faces in reconciling deep divisions among her own party members was further highlighted as Conservatives, who want to remain in the EU, joined other anti-Brexit protests in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers plan on track and is under fire from Brexit supporters, opponents, and the EU.
Allies said she would continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition - forcing those opposed to Brexit and the Labour Party to choose between her plan and the Brexit referendum.
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave protest march in Solihull that he wanted to get rid of the Chequers' plans.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been allowed to participate and assume responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would be out now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit but we have to get rid of the Chequers plan".
He explained his opposition to the EU, saying: "We did not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own songs in our own country.
Mr Bone cited indications that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: "The notion that the British public has changed its mind and wants to stay the same is completely false".
Andrea Jenkyns, a staunch Brexit supporter, was also at the rally, telling reporters: "I want to simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular with the public and the opposition will not vote for it, but it is unpopular with our party members and activists who are out in the streets voting for us.
Do that, stop with the Chequers plan and start listening.
In a direct message to May, she added: 'Prime Ministers keep their promises when they keep their job.
Mr Farage said politicians should be made to feel the pressure if they were to back down from the decision taken following the 2016 vote.
"It is now about trust between us - the people - and our political party", he said.
They want to try to derail Brexit, and we're here today to tell them we're not going to let you get away with this.
He added in his message to the crowd: 'I want you to put pressure on your political party, which is about to give up on Brexit.
We are the public forces in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud Great Britain.
At the same time, pro-EU protesters held a rally in Birmingham, which culminated in a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved the anti-Brexit Conservative flags after the group was set up over the weekend.
Adonis Lavarður, from the Labour Party, made fun of conservatives because of security issues that were raised in the party's phone program when the conference opened.
"These are the people who are telling us that we can have all the computer systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for border without barriers, for free trade with Ireland without borders", he added.
This is a complete shock.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he said.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
Elizabeth Warren, a U.S. Senator, says she's considering a serious run for the presidency after the November election.
A report in the Boston Globe says the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has been a vocal critic of U.S. President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the focus of concerns that she might run against Trump in 2020.
The Holyoke meeting on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting in the form of a town hall meeting with residents of her constituency since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she had any plans to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our government, and then we also needed a woman to lead.
Arrested after fatal shooting of Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the case of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who was shot to death on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. this morning.
She had earlier posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying a man seen on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot to death near the campus of Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died from his injuries", Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, told reporters Saturday, according to a 247sports report.
Wayde came to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the scene, with a weapon in his holster, and admitted to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was six feet tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, he played in 32 games, including 10 starts last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 assists per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the winning car at the behest of their team.
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas took the front seat in front of Lewis Hamilton at the pre-race on Saturday that the commands of the Mercedes team would play a big part in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start in the fight, and almost separated Hamilton after he defended his position in the first two laps and ordered Vettel to fight against his teammate.
Vettel went first into the trench and had Hamilton drive into the end of the group, but it should have been able to score.
The Mercedes entered the pit lane one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton emerged after a close battle where the Ferrari driver was forced to leave the inside after running the risk of being left behind, after a safety attempt in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started late in the group and was seventh at the end of the first lap, on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race, having delayed changing tyres to try to finish quickly and outperform Kimi Raikkonen to finish fourth.
He eventually went into the ditch on lap 44, but could not pick up speed for the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri has been splendid all weekend and was a true gentleman to help me out.
The team has put in a tremendous effort to achieve this", said Hamilton.
That was a really bad physical.
U.S. President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein in a meeting on Saturday, over her alleged failure to leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court's nominee, of sexual harassment.
The president was speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, but did not directly address Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead saying that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "bad and cruel and untruthful".
"The only thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has been going on these last days in the Elders' Hall, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and hurt and cruel and untruthful", he said.
When you see the signs and the things and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it".
I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you gonna let this go?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document - oh, ha, what?
Oh, no, you are not.
I'm not going to lie.
Now, wait a minute.
"No, we don't", he said, and he followed the senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, which revealed Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and was therefore leaked in early September.
"I didn't cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to a report from The Hill.
 She asked me to keep it confidential and I did as she asked me to.
But her denial didn't seem to go over well with the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday, "I'll tell you what, it was a really bad physical injury.
Maybe she didn't do anything, but that was the worst bodybuilding I've ever seen.
The president continued his defense of Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, and suggested that Democrats were exploiting the allegations to their advantage.
They are determined to regain power, whatever the means necessary.
You see the cruelty, the despair, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to take over to get power and control", the president said, according to a report by Mediaite.
The Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for their loss on Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants, winning the next game in a row, 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took an early two-point lead after scores from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for home, but Dwyer got the Giants back on the board.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee and two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen then secured their victory.
It was the third loss of the season for Adam Keefe's team in the Elite League, having beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the fourth minute at 3:35 after a stop by Kendall McFaull, followed by a second by David Rutherford when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
There was a lot of first-minute action, and Sullivan returned to the game at 1:10 p.m. with Cownie equaling after a fifteen-minute stoppage from Matt Marquardt.
Dwyer helped the Giants get a halftime lead when he scored his second touchdown of the game late in the first quarter.
The home team came together and Bouchard recovered a goal when they were one man over in the 27th minute of the second half.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together and helped Nielsen bring Dundee to the first of the game late in the second quarter, and he secured his team's victory with a fifth goal as half of the final quarter was over.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will take on Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller gives his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a massive earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Large aftershocks continue to hit the area, with many trapped under the rubble in the city of Palu.
The 21-year-old, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, refused to leave, despite the fact that his colleagues had escaped the control tower that had been violently suspended at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He was on the ground to ensure that Batik Air flight number 6321, which was on the tarmac when the earthquake struck, could safely take off.
He then jumped off the handlebars when he thought he was going to fall.
He later died in a hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News of Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could reach Palu.
"We are very sad to hear this", he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could exceed a thousand, with the country's transport agency saying access is restricted to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The number of deaths is still rising, as many bodies are still buried under rubble and unreachable", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Tides of up to 20 feet [6 m] have wreaked havoc in Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are working to bring in relief supplies and provisions.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is arriving with a body.
There is little clean water.
The retail stores have been robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to find survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the projects related to the bridge transportation.
Are you ready?" she said on CNN.
Earlier this year, earthquakes struck Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia air crash: Air Niugini now says one is missing after plane crashed into the air
The airline that had a plane that crashed over the island of Micronesia now says that one person is missing, after previously saying that all 47 passengers and crew were rescued from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, it was unaware of the disappearance of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about the passenger's details, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane had crashed into the bay just ahead of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had gone too far over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane's approach was extremely low.
"It was really good", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to swim the mid-water mark and reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the pilots were frightened and screaming, and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors, who were at work near the dam, also assisted in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people ashore before the plane sank in about 100 feet [30 m] of water.
Data from the Air Safety Authority shows that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered aircraft in the past two decades, none of which were related to Air Niugini.
Expert describes the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The defendant closes his case on Saturday in a retrial against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert from the U.S. Department of Justice, spent many hours in the courtroom as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to combine the travels of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to his earlier claims, according to a report in The Clarion Ledger.
When records showed that his cell phone was with Chamber at the same time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said it was a lie because my car was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Phone records show they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her text messages, phone calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He took her out of his life", Hale said.
The guards are scheduled to deliver their final address on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be heard by a grand jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip hop trio wants to combat negative attitudes toward the music industry by infusing positive messages into their music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, argues that hip hop has moved farther from its roots, as it has political messages and social issues.
They want to find their origins and make hip hop conscious again.
Artists including The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
A New York City couple sues for divorce after a "disgusting" text message from their daughter.
A New York City couple sued for illegal divorce after she received a surprise text message from her mother complaining that she was "just a black person".
Pariad denies being biased and likened the lawsuit to "money laundering".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her displeasure when she learned that her new foster daughter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first went to work in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
After discovering his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman's "unfortunate" Mrs. Maurice said that their former foster child, who was a German, had been ill, and that she had been expecting a Filipinos wife, according to a report in the New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day of work and then sent home in an Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple and is seeking damages for the breach, in the amount of $350 a day for the six months she was originally hired for, although no contract was signed.
"I wanted to show them that this is not the way to do it", she told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination.
The couple have denied accusations of prejudice and say that Maurice's dismissal was the right thing to do, since they felt that they could not trust her after she had been abused.
My wife sent her a message she wasn't going to tell.
She's not judgmental.
"We are not prejudiced people", her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
But who would trust their children to someone after showing the appropriate kindness, even if it was surprising?
His newborn?
Don't look like that.
Plasco compared the lawsuit to a "money scam", saying that his wife was seven months pregnant and in "a very difficult situation".
Are you going to attack someone in this condition?
It's not very nicely done", said Plasco, who works in the investment industry.
The case is still pending, but the public has been harshly criticized on social media, and the couple has been shamed for their behavior and rational thinking.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would find it difficult to like a talking bear, according to a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, born shortly after the book was approved, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny now that we know of the great success of Paddington.
She said her father, who worked as a BBC photographer before being inspired to write a children's book about a little teddy bear, had taken the writing of his work with a calm positivity, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "a real pain" after his death last year.
As for Paddington, whom she described as "an important family member", she added that her father had shown quiet pride in his eventual success.
"He was a very quiet man and did not usually mount", she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who accomplishes something, you're proud of it even if you didn't actually do anything yourself.
I think he's seen Paddington's success in some ways.
Although Paddington was his creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been taken to the Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but to no avail.
"Nad called regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to survive", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
 Then Nad called me and said that she would die within the next two minutes and that I would have to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you in a moment.
I'll be with you.
The medication that the doctors had given her to keep her heart rate up was slowly losing its effect and being excreted from her body.
She had died shortly before, and this body was giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all happening.
I couldn't yell or scream or cry, because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to control myself.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who were unaware of the ordeal she had experienced.
"Nobody knew anything", she said.
I nodded and cried the whole time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a great empathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Mourning women hang up messages to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose lovers committed suicide are now trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted messages on a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Miss Davis' son, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I have to feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son had been a successful chef with an infectious smile.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could light up any room.
He stopped working before he died, for he was cast down into a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother dead after he took his own life.
Miss Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that it's going to be followed by that".
Miss Davis created the message to let people know that it's possible to go and talk to someone else, even a friend.
Don't sit and say nothing - you need to talk to someone.
Miss Humphreys, who has been a friend of Miss Davies for years, lost her husband, Mark, when she was 15, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about being sick or depressed or anything like that", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was up to his worst on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or anything.
She said that his death was a shock to them, but that they would have to work through it: "This could affect our family.
This is gonna tear us apart.
But we must keep going and fight.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance as the FBI investigates
'I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for - a study with limited time and scope - we might be able to reach a little bit of a compromise,' Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was being divided into two camps where everything was backwards.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their attraction is due to the timing.
With the midterm elections only five weeks away, on November 6, if the Republicans do as badly as they're expected, it will seriously weaken their efforts to get their man elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has been calling Senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases their investigation report?
The measure will be voted on in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting as-is.
It's not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, but it would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him as the highest-ranking judge.
Number of people fleeing North Korea 'decreases' under Kim
The number of people fleeing North Korea for South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Council, said that 1,127 people fled last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher fees charged by smugglers with people were key factors.
Pyongyang has not issued any official statement.
The vast majority of those who flee North Korea are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee to China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the virtually neutral zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the migrants to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often forces them to return to their home country.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for discussions that focused on the negotiating deadline for nuclear disarmament.
This followed the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in broad terms to work together towards a nuclear-free Korea.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho informed American businessmen of the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to unilaterally dismantle our nuclear weapons first", Ri said in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "a moron" and says he's unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "a moron" and said he was too creative to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these remarks in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever done that, she would have been called a gynecologist", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh passionately denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was highly emotional, sometimes almost shouting and getting a lump in his throat when discussing his family and school years.
He also publicly denounced the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "a fraudulent and orchestrated man-made attack" orchestrated by liberal activists angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed that he was biased against Democrats.
"I think these allegations and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats show that he is unfit for office", she said.
Pelosi did not respond to a question about whether she would try to get Kavanaugh fired if he is confirmed and if Democrats win a majority in the House.
"I'll say this: if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only unfit to be on the Supreme Court, but also on the court that he is now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential rulings against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion laws in Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is no time for a morbid, prejudiced person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say 'this is wonderful.' " Pelosi said.
And women have to take advantage of that.
This is a true saying, months and years of zeal flowing out, and she does not leave it without crying.
"We cry when we get angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's uncommon, but you?
And she went on, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was the executive of a place and said that she cried when she got angry, too, but she had developed a technique so that when she got angry and started crying, she said to her interviewer, "You might think I'm dumb because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you.
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was great.
Tears are permissible expressions of anger in part because they are based on a fundamental misunderstanding.
One of my vivid memories from my previous job in a male-dominated office, where I started to cry with a rage I couldn't express, and an older woman came and grabbed my neck, and she was a cold boss who I had always been a little afraid of, and she pulled me into a stairwell.
"Then never let me see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're a firecracker.
They think you're a Baptist and are happy to have you.
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart in the presidential campaign, but she was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught cheating on board a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew his candidacy, Ms. Schroeder, in exasperation, felt there was no reason why she couldn't consider running for president herself.
"It was not a well-considered decision", she told me laughingly, 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
As the campaign was in full swing, she was concerned about the fundraising, so she called to say she would not run unless she could raise $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" she wondered.
When she delivered her speech announcing that she would not be officially running, she was so overwhelmed by emotion - gratitude to the people who had supported her, resentment of the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and direct her views to voters instead of representatives, and anger at the gender gap - that she burst into tears.
'You might think I had a nervous breakdown,' said Ms Schroeder, recalling the media reaction.
You'd think Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my tombstone?
Did she cry?
The prospect of a trade war between the US and China could be good for Beijing
The first shots of the trade war between the United States and China were devastating, and although the war is far from over, the trade war between the two countries could be profitable for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired his first warning shot earlier this year by imposing tariffs on China's major exports, including solar panels, steel and iron.
The biggest blow came this week with new tariffs that will hit $200 billion worth of goods, taxing as much as half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has responded in the same coin each time, recently imposing 5 to 10 percent tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has been reacting to the US tariff and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will be able to withdraw soon.
To make Washington jump, you have to make concessions, but it would be too humiliating for President Xi Jinping of China to publicly bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing is to keep the ball in its court, the pressure from the trade war with the US could have a positive impact on China in the long run, by reducing the mutual need of both economies for each other.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in either Washington or Beijing could lead to a situation that leads to an economic collapse in either country is actually more dangerous than observers have previously admitted", said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria is preparing for the return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to welcome refugees back voluntarily and is seeking help to rebuild the country, now in a bad shape after seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
'Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the successes in the fight against terrorism,' he said.
The government continues to maintain a state of normalcy by building up areas that were previously occupied by terrorists.
The stage is now set for the return of refugees willingly to the countries they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic decisions that targeted their daily lives and jobs.
An estimated 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people still living in the country need help.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian authorities would welcome assistance in rebuilding the country.
However, he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
A European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating a US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 points at the Le Golf National course outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when the team, led by Danish goalkeeper Thomas Bjorn, scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling for most of the tournament, hit his opening shot from above into the water on the 16th hole, which is a par 3, and lost his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari skipped all of his matches and became the first of four players to have a 5-0-0 record since the tournament began using its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, but he was in the bottom of the rankings of players in the European team.
Dustin Johnson, the top ranked golfer in the world, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have been playing in his last Ryder Cup match.
Sergio Garcia, an eight-time Ryder Cup winner, became the most successful European player with 25.5 points.
I don't normally cry, but today I can't help myself.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to get my cup back.
It's about the team, and I was happy to help", said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He is the defending champion, but he defeated American golfer Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a singles match on Sunday.
"I was incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup competition.
This is a strange result for one of the greatest players in history, who has won 14 major titles and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a tough time all weekend finding themselves on the court, apart from Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played well throughout the tournament.
The U.S. team leader, Jim Furyk, after being disappointed by his team's performance, said, "I'm proud of them, they fought.
It was sometime in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We dropped him.
I'll take over for Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 of his players play very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee and we'll keep going.
I love these 12 men and am proud to be their leader.
You have to take the top.
They played better than us.
