Obama becomes the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
The American president Barack Obama will fly into Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The award will be a diploma, medal and cheque for his exceptional efforts to improve global diplomacy and encourage international cooperation, among other things.
The Head of the White House will be flying into Norway in the morning with his wife Michelle and will have a busy schedule.
First, he will visit the Nobel Institute, where he will have his first meeting with five committee members who have selected him from 172 people and 33 organisations.
The presidential couple then meets with King Harald V and Queen Sonja of Norway.
Then, in the afternoon, the visit will conclude with a grand ceremony, at which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
The fourth American president to receive the prize, and only the third to have received it while in office.
The White House has stated that, when he accepts the prize, Obama will speak about Afghanistan.
The president does not want to skirt around this topic, as he recognizes that he is accepting the prize as a president whose country is currently at war in two countries.
A few days ago he stepped up the war effort by sending more troops to Afghanistan, something that his critics will be stressing.
The ceremony will also include a gold medal, diploma, and a cheque for ten million Swedish kronor (around 24 million Czech crowns).
The donor is planning to give this money to charity, but has not decided on which.
Their busy schedule will then take them to a banquet, which will be attended by the Norwegian king and queen, the ministeral chairman and another 250 invited guests.
Obama has always been reticent about his prize.
The former has reported that he feels that he does not fully deserve it.
The prize is not for him, but for everyone who values the same values.
After hearing about it, he described it as a challenge to take action.
Nature protection officers accused of blackmailing
Litoměřice police have accused the Litoměřice Nature Protection Society civil association of blackmail.
The latter has been a repeated case of a building permit dispute, and has then claimed money from investors for retracing the appeal, according to Litoměřice police spokeswoman Alena Romová.
The Chairman of Litoměřice Nature Protection Society is Lubomir Studnička.
The man is now under arrest and faces up to three years in prison.
Recycling containers do not smell so good in Brno
In Prague, normal people can sort their drink bottles, and in South Moravian, villages have recycling containers on every corner.
And Brno?
There, it will take you a good few minutes to find the right sort of bin.
I do not mean to imply that garbage is not sorted in Brno.
It seems to me that considering we are the second largest city in the country, the authorities are not showing enough interest in this problem.
However, Brno is going way back in its garbage sorting, not only because people here can still only put paper, glass and plastic into these bins, but mostly because of the lack of containers for this type of waste.
You have ever tried throwing a plastic bottle into a city centre?
It is a real art form, and you need time and steady nerves.
The only place we have managed to get to is on Moravské náměstí, opposite the Potrefená Husa.
No complaints to Mr Onderka and his colleagues, but it is really not good enough.
Not to mention that it is no easy task sorting garbage in other parts of the city.
Plenty of my friends do not bother sorting their garbage.
Out of laziness.
It is just too far to the bin, you see.
I do not blame them.
After a party I offered to throw out a few glass and plastic bottles.
Then, on Kounicova ulice, no coloured bins were seen.
Luckily, on the way to the tram I found the right place.
It was overflowing with garbage.
This is the centre of Brno. Does it look good?
It should, but ecology and aesthetics do not seem to interest Brno socialists much.
The city prefers to buy a new hockey extra-league, which would put us in the shame of the country, instead of buying a few more containers and letting us sort other garbage for a clean Brno.
I am glad to see that, after browsing the net for a while, my assumptions are confirmed by official statistics.
Reports from EKO-KOM show that Brno is the worst off in South Moravia.
"Parobek's budget takes money for pensions and sick pay
The fact that the left gave extra money to farmers and civil servants in the face of government opinion means that there may not be enough money in the budget to cover pensions, sick pay, or building society savings.
It is also not enough for interest on national debt or to cover international judicial disputes.
This will bring problems for whoever is in office in the latter half of next year, said Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists raised interest rates for certain groups, they rely on the fact that the government would loan money for susceptible expenses, pensions, and sick pay.
The higher interest is paid on loaned money and, at some point, it must be paid back.
The state has no choice where to find it.
If it does not reduce social benefits or the costs of running the state, it will have to increase taxes.
For all those that the left just handed money to: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later, their children also.
People do not have to worry about pensions or sick pay, where 1.8 billion has disappeared from the accounts; they will get them.
However, at the cost of further debt - next year the treasury will be 163 billion short.
However, despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will continue to increase at an ever increasing rate, as will interest costs.
The state will need money to cover it, and it is no longer enough to bump up VAT or reduce maternity benefits, as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
As money has been diverted to several groups of voters, next year there will be a shortage of five billion for highways and railroads.
This is mostly tendered out and half-finished and cannot be redesigned or made any cheaper.
At most, conserve what is not free too.
This means that delaying or delaying thirty major building projects and European fund is also at risk, says transport minister Karel Hanzelka.
The Communist Party of the Republic has suggested that the deficit should be resolved Solomon-style – it should draw on the dividends of the Czech Republic, mostly state-owned, and use them to top up the transport fund.
The problem is that the level of these dividends is never certain, and they are certainly not a bottomless resource.
This year, 18 billion of Czech Republic money went into the budget.
Every year, these dividends are used to clear up environmental damage, topping the pensions account, or are used as a reserve for the upcoming pension reforms.
Moreover, according to EU regulations, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP.
This is not the end of these transfers.
The budget is almost three billion shot to cover various damages owed to the victims of communism and crime, to meet the cost of judicial disputes, and even to cover building society savings.
It is still unclear if the state can survive without this money.
It's a gamble.
If we lose an international dispute, we still have to pay, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save money within the resort or, in worst case, reach into the government's budget reserve.
The two billion-crown State Treasury project, which is already underway, is also lacking a hundred million, and what each office is spending can be followed on-line.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister cannot find the money elsewhere, the project will have to be aborted and sanctions will be imposed.
Next smartphone will run two operating systems
The Americans are talking about the future of users being able to switch between different operating systems on their mobile phones with a button.
The plans so far look promising.
One key and in a few seconds you can switch from Windows Mobile to Android.
This is the goal of the American company Vmware, which mainly develops computer virtualisation software.
This will allow you to have two user profiles on the same phone.
You can switch between them or have one for work and one for home.
Both will run at the same time, says Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview with Computer World magazine.
It was presented last November and first demonstrated just a few days ago.
It will go on sale in 2012.
Virtualisation of smartphones is not science fiction.
VMware has already given reporters a demonstration of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was a modified N800 with 128 MB of RAM, running Windows Mobile and Android at the same time.
The development of new mobile phone technology is going on.
VMware is now working with European and American operators to test smartphone virtualisation and the sets should reach customers sometime in 2012.
lack of snow in mountain areas cause problems for hoteliers
It is not only Krkonoše ski lift operators who are concerned with these bare slopes.
The lack of snow is driving people away from skiing in hotels and guesthouses.
This means vacancies are still available in the Krkonoše throughout the winter, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We are getting a lot of visitors to our site.
People are browsing the offers, checking prices, but, until now, are still hesitant to make a definite booking.
When they call, the first question they ask is if we think they will see snow or mud.
Anyone who wants to spend New Year’s Eve in Špindlerův Mlýn just how they want should start thinking about booking soon.
The ones who want to save money and go for cheaper accommodation can still give it a few days.
Hospitality businesses in Špindlerův Mlý are currently only offering week-long stays for New Year’s Eve.
I think they'll try to keep that up for a while, but even they will give in and offer shorter stays.
Then there will be sudden shortage of vacancies, says Jandura.
The Vrchlabi travel agency Ingtours is still offering vacancies throughout the winter.
What we are interested in is Christmas week, which is still not sold out.
Half of our capacity is still available.
The reason for this is that we have been preparing some last-minute Christmas breaks.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can still offer New Year’s Eve in the Krkonoše, but vacancies are fewer.
The second fortnight in February is a good time for bookings, but bookings for the winter dates tend to be average.
This year, winter breaks are low due to the fact that there is still no snow on the Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if any fall.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountain when there is no snow.
If snow falls on the slopes this week, Christmas will sell out too.
The other hand, the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou has seen better bookings this year than last year.
We are up about 5 percent.
We have last few vacancies for New Year's Eve and Christmas.
The interest is very high in Poland holidays in January and we usually get a lot of bookings in February too.
The Omnia Hotel, by the central car park in Janské Lázně, is eighty percent booked up for New Year's Eve.
Newest hotel in Janské Lázně still has half its beds free for Christmas.
January this year has been a nice surprise, as we are already sixty percent booked up.
The February weather is not quite as good, but as soon as it snows, the interest in staying in the Krkonoše will definitely rise, says the owner of Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
The Krkonoše hoteliers will have to wait for heavy snowfall.
Very cold weather is forecast for Thursday, so if anything falls, it should be snow.
The temperature should increase again, said Jiří Jakubský of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute in Hradec.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
The funny thing is that Obama, known to be the most wise president, is trying to replicate the strategy of his predecessor, having himself considered him to be the most foolish.
When he finally came out with his long-awaited Afghan doctrine, it appeared to have made a carbon copy of Bush's Iraq scenario three years earlier.
The text is not only that he repeatedly uses the words "just like in Iraq", but he even used the name of Bush's declaration from January 2007 as the title of his own declaration: The new way forward.
While three years ago he himself called the idea to send fresh troops to help in the beleaguered civil war in Iraq as "an irresponsible decision with fatal consequences".
The following months showed that Bush's strategy, recommended by his field commanders, was the only possible course of action and so successful that no reports about Iraq are reported.
It did not help Bush's reputation, but in objective terms, it left his successor in a much better position than might be expected.
Obama hopes that, in Afghanistan, the miracle will repeat itself.
The military contingent was again requested by his field commanders, particularly the supreme commander of the Afghan operation General Stanley McChrystal, who even went against the custom of his subordinates to harshly criticize reluctant gunners in the White House.
The commander asked for 40 thousand men to turn the situation around.
The president hesitant for three months, but failed to come up with anything better, and so the general took out of 10 thousand soldiers.
The promise was almost a promise for another 5 thousand, although he was originally counting on 10.
The most difficult aspect of Obama's strategy seems to be his plan to start troops out of Afghanistan within 18 months and to finish the process in three years.
Many doubt that this half-hearted increase will produce the same fruit as the action plan in Iraq.
Although recent internal crisis has been a relatively stable society, its leaders have been adhering to the treaties.
The Afghan situation is exactly the opposite - nobody can be relied on and no treaties are being enforced.
In such conditions, it is difficult for Afghan security forces to prepare, being so used to changing leaders to suit themselves.
Political institutions, no matter how formally they are set up, will be nothing more than a Potemkin village in which patriarchal tribal relations will run wild.
Conflicting interests of a variety of ethnic groups is usually difficult due to the complex relations between them, which is further complicated by the influence of Pakistan and Iran.
Even building an operational state, which is the most basic aim of the operation, seems to be almost impossible.
The time of Obama's strategy is controlled by his voluntarism.
The situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now on the verge of exploding.
Only a true romantic soul, totally unaffected by reality, could believe that the soldiers sent into the turmoil of this war for an "early return home" will bring any miracles here.
From a political perspective it is pure irresponsibility setting a date for the withdrawal of the troops, as the Taliban will see it as indirect recognition of an American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the European people are increasingly willing to participate in Afghanistan operations.
European politicians cannot and are unwilling to explain to voters what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the Hindu Kush mountains.
Other factors that could radically stir things are what is going on around Iran.
If the situation continues to get worse and increase sanctions against Iran do not have any effect, the United States will face the difficult question of whether to try to resolve the situation with military force or not.
This will be answered when, according to Obama, America orders the victorious withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan.
Any such solution will certainly mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only saving grace for Obama is that there are three more years to the presidential elections, so there is still time to come up with another strategy if this one turns out to be a total whitewash.
Goldman Sachs Management no longer receive cash bonuses
The top management of American bank Goldman Sachs will not receive their cash bonuses this year.
The announcement came from the company in response to the harsh criticism of their salary policy.
Instead of money, the group of 30 top managers will receive shares, which cannot be sold for another five years.
The shares can also be confiscated if the management take excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is leading the effort to link Wall Street bonuses with long-term performance.
I assume that Wall Street is well aware of the broader path it has to take, said former investment banker for JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has been targeted by critics since it set aside near 17 billion dollars (almost 300 billion crowns) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The announcement does not include any bonuses for the business this year, despite today's announcement.
High bonuses in the banking sector, with the economic crisis, have become a political hot potato.
The UK announced that it would charge a one-off fifty percent tax rate on bankers' bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds (around 712,000 CZK).
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women were awarded the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics.
In Stockholm today, a record five women received Nobel Prizes from the Swedish king Carl XVI Gustaf in the professional and literature categories.
In addition to four scientists, they also included the German writer Herta Müller, originally from Romania.
The Nobel for medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their fellow countryman Jack Szostak, for their research in chromosomes.
The Chemistry prize was won by the Israeli Ada Jonath, together with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for their work to clarify the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last award was the Nobel Prize for Economics, which was awarded to the Americans Elinor Ostrom and Oliver Williamson for their analysis of economic management.
The only specialised category that nobody won this year was physics.
Today, this award was awarded by the scientists Charles Kao for his research in optical fibres, and George Smith and Willard Boyle for inventing the CCD ship, which is the basis for all digital cameras, faxes, and astronomical telescopes.
All the winners received diploma, the Nobel Medal, and a certificate for monetary reward.
In each category this award totals ten million Swedish kronor (approximately 25 million CZK).
If there are multiple winners, they share the prize money between them.
The most highly anticipated award, the Nobel Peace Prize, was awarded to the American president Barack Obama in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged that the award was controversial, as he is just starting in office and also heads a country currently in a conflict with two countries - Iraq and Afghanistan.
In his defense of his policy he added that these wars were essential to bring about peace, despite the high cost.
Klaus invites him to the Castle.
The President will meet with finance minister Eduard Janota, who is considering resigning as he is not agreeing with the government's next year's budget as approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
The budget and Janota's possible continuation in office will be the topic of Friday's meeting.
The budget has also been criticised by Klaus.
The deficit is too high, which is worsening the public funding crisis.
The meeting was announced by the President's spokesman Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to discuss his future on Monday with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer.
The Budget Act, which Klaus is due to sign, would allow Czech Republic to get by with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
However, on Wednesday, the House approved the left's proposals to transfer funds, gave state employees a pay rise, and allocated extra money for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticised the social democrats' proposals, which threatened to increase the budget deficit.
The political dispute has broken up between the left and the government, Klaus, and the right, leading to questions about the future of Fischer's interim government, which was agreed on in spring by the ODS, ČSSD and Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as approved by the House, essentially takes away from the saving measures implemented by Fischer's government in autumn, which it believes will prevent the state falling deeper into debt.
The breakfast meeting with entrepreneurs today, Klaus, who is behind the state budget but is not obliged to sign it, called for a "serious problem" which is the "unsustainable deficit level" of public finances.
Now he claims no good solution to this.
The only thing that can improve the situation is a strong government which could fall back on the broader consensus of the political parties, the president says.
ODS chairman Mirek Topolánek said that it was a terrible budget and that the government should rethink its continued office.
The vice chairman of the ODS, Petr Nečas, told ČTK that the concept of an interim government supported by the Communist Party, ODS and the Green Party is no longer working.
In response to this, Premier Fischer described this statement as "strong words."
The head of the Czech Socialist Party, Jiří Parubek, spoke to Topolánek by warning that the deficit in the previous Topolánek government for this year exceeded 200 billion crowns.
Wednesday the CSSD declared the approval of the next year's budget a success.
People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman is played by Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's new film.
They claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus will tell the world about their country, its struggle and its victories, despite some people criticising the fact that the main roles are played by American actors.
It is a story about sport, race relations, and Nelson Mandela.
The life of the tireless fighter against apartheid in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played by the Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman told a friend that he had asked Mandela if he could play him in Eastwood's film.
The second lead role in the film is played by Matt Damon.
If I am going to play you, I will need access to you.
The seventy-two year old actor, who won an Oscar for his role in Eastwood's boxing drama Million Dollar Baby, has already played roles such as the leader of the anti-slavery movement who eventually became a slave, a fictitious president of the USA, and even a god in Evan Almighty.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his active role in the eradication of apartheid in South Africa.
The release of the prisoner occurred in 1990 and he was then the country's president for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is Latin for 'unconquered' and is a poem by the English writer William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like he does.
The film tells the true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unify the country.
The believer in sport is that people can unite through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who, to the world, are outsiders.
The South Africa team eventually reaches the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story to the big screen.
My only aim was to play this role as realistically as possible, said Freeman.
Naturally, the most difficult challenge was to speak like Mandela.
The actor told that if he and world politicians were in the same ball park, he would try to meet Mandela, go for dinner with him, and be behind the scene with him before his speeches.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found out that when I take your hand, I draw on your energy, it flows into me and I feel that I know how you are feeling, he said.
For me it is important to try and become different person.
In the film, Matt Damon portrayes François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, which was dominated by white players.
The actor says he spent six months in the rugby world to prepare for the role.
It was a great surprise for him when he first saw Pienaar at his home.
When I remember ringing his doorbell, he opened it, and I remember talking to François Pienaar, he opened it and the first thing I said to him was: 'I look much bigger on the screen.'
In spite of the apparent differences in the stature of the actors compared to their real-life counterparts, under Eastwood's direction, Invictus has received positive reviews and even talks of an Oscar nomination.
The Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summarised the film by saying: "It was a great story, a very well made film."
In Rotten Tomatoes reviews, Invictus has a 76 percent positive rating.
The secret of the glare over Norway was solved: Russia was testing a rocket.
Strange lights of unknown origin have been seen over Norway.
Today Russia’s defence ministry finally admitted that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile not far from the Norwegian border.
However, it was another unsuccessful launch and the missile, which should have been the pride and glory of the Russian army, gradually becomes a nightmare for the Russian generals and Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
The repeated presence of him at test flights on the rocket has not affected the success rate of the test flights.
The Bulava is generally not lifted off or has been damaged in the air.
The Russian newspapers are describing the "Bulava" as "the flightless rocket."
The rocket that does not fly but lights up
This, the 13th test, started off according to plan.
Then near the end of the flight there was technical damage to the missile.
According to the engine blew up in the rocket's third phase.
This time, the "Bulava" was launched from the atomic submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which was cruising under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of rocket can be launched from a craft which is moving and even submerged.
The mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object is likely to be the malfunctioning "Bulava."
Anyway, the Norwegians never believed that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals are defending themselves this time, claiming that it cannot be defined as a total failure.
The first two phases of the rocket went well, and the accident occurred during the third stage.
Previously, engines have always malfunctioned during the first phase.
The test launch has not been error-free, but the defence ministry considers only six out of the thirteen tests have been failures.
The generals are optimistic about this almost fifty percent success rate and keep pressing that the "Bulava" will eventually fly smoothly and will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks weighing 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signs a year's contract with CSKA Moscow aged 51
The legendary defender Vjačeslav Fetisov will again play a professional ice hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup holder will be playing in the fifth KHL duel against Saint Petersburg.
FETISHOV, who retired at forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
Denis Kuljaš was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is regularly training and has agreed to help the team.
The Moscow club coach Sergej Němčinov told the AP agency.
The rumors are still awaiting for the famous hockey player's return.
FETISH is someone who can boost the morale of other players, according to Němčinov.
If Fetisov returns to the ice, he will be the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, the legendary defender Gordie Howe played for Hartford for a whole season at the age of fifty-one and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet of Fetisov, Kasatonov, Makarov, and Krutov is one of the most successful hockey players of all time.
In the Soviet Union uniform, he received two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship tiles, and triumphed in Canada Cup and Junior World Championships.
In the second half of his career, he also enjoyed success in the NHL, when wearing the Detroit uniform he twice raised the Stanley Cup over his head.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai obliges unions. All overtime is cut.
The management of the Hyundai car plant in Nošovice has agreed to cut all overtime.
It is because of all this forced overtime that the unions have declared a strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the Hyundai spokesman, Petr Vaněk.
The management however wants to reach an agreement with the trade union leaders for one Saturday shift this year.
Because we cannot give up on our production plan, it is essential, so we have proposed voluntary overtime on Saturday December 19th, involving two shifts, said Vaněk.
The website Sedmička.cz reported that the firm offered all employees who work the Saturday shift a bonus of 400 CZK.
This bonus will also be paid retrospectively to those who worked on Saturday November 28th.
According to Vaněk, the firm has decided to change how it motivates its employees to take the proposed overtime.
Both will claim the additional wage for overtime or they can take time off in place on December 28th and extend their Christmas holiday by one day, said Vaněk.
Additionally, all employees working the Saturday shift will have their travel and lunch paid for.
The most pressing and thorny question for the unions and for the protesting workers that caused the collapse of production last week, the management decided to immediately cancel all overtime for December, added Vaněk.
The workers kept working for almost every day, including every day they had to do two hours' overtime on top of their normal eight-hour shifts.
After signing the agreement, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the strike.
Next meetings are planned between the plant management and union leaders on Friday morning.
The head of the unions, Petr Kuchař, said if they agree on the demands and sign the document, they are willing to strike.
The situation at the plant deteriorated sharply last Wednesday when some 400 workers held a spontaneous strike to protest against the rising overtime.
The students were also protesting against poor pay conditions and alleged persecution.
The management responded by telling employees to work overtime to meet the demand for cars.
In Monday’s announcement of the strike, the unions also requested no sanctions against the workers who halted production last Wednesday.
The trade unions are asking the firm to keep overtime to a minimum.
Moreover, this year they are requesting that a 5000 crown bonus be paid for this work.
The Hyundai car plant in Nošovice now employs 2000 people.
The firm started series production last November.
By September, it produced around 80,000 cars, and its current capacity is 200,000 vehicles a year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on 'tough' forms of HIV virus
The Czech and German team have been testing a new compound that can slow the spread of HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of this improved substance is that it also works on viruses which have become immune to medication.
In some cases, this does not offset the fact that the compound used for the normal form of the virus has such a strong effect as some drugs that are available.
No cure has yet been found for AIDS.
Patients' lives can be greatly prolonged by a mix of drugs that prevent the HIV virus from multiplying in the body.
However, they have many side effects.
Moreover, if the virus is not completely suppressed, it can lead to the development of resistant viruses, against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work done by experts from three institutions, Czech Academy of Sciences, VŠCHT Prague, and Heidelberg University, is opening the way to deal with the virus' resistance.
They have shown that substances known as metallacarboranes act on the protein responsible for HIV virus proliferation.
Metallacarboranes are a compound of boron, hydrogen, carbon, and cobalt.
This compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way to all other drugs in use today, and so they may get over the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists are coming up with new ‘improved’ compounds, prepared using knowledge of the molecular mechanism and its relation to the virus protein.
Metallacarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected to a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
The treacherous and harsh virus is a treacherous and hard virus.
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential to the virus’ lifecycle.
The mature infectious viral corpuscles would not occur if the HIV virus was not split by HIV protease.
If we stop HIV protease, we will also stop the virus from spreading through the patient's body, the scientists explained in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see diagram) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
Somewhat weaker, but more reliable
The effectiveness of this series of substances against HIV protease has been tested in a test-tube, as well its effectiveness against the more immune(resistant) strain acquired from HIV virus infected patients.
The effect of metallacarboranes on the normal strain of the enzyme is not as strong as that of currently used drugs, but they do not diminish against the resistant strains, whereas currently used drugs are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of its effect and other properties, such as its biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications, make metallacarboranes an important compound for future research aimed at suggesting effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the Structural Biology laboratory at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
ODS attacks Fischer, who defends himself.
The head of the ODS, Mirek Topolánek, described the next year's budget as "terrible" and asked the government to seriously rethink its position in office.
The government chairman described the ODS statement as strong words.
Maybe he will take time to think about it.
The vice chairman of the ODS, Petr Nečas, said that the concept of an interim government supported by the ČSSD, ODS, and Green Party was no longer working.
According to Nečas, the government chairman must decide if he wants to leave the minority in the House to fight the growing deficit or if he wants to stay in office with the support of the left.
The approaches taken by the ODS and social democrats on public deficits are diametrically opposite, Nečas pointed out.
The House approved the 2010 budget, naturally with the left's proposed amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House gave extra money for state employees, social services, and direct payments to farmers.
The government called for the social democrats' proposals, which threatened to increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should get by with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
After the vote, the ODS left the room, following the government's wishes that the amended budget is not as poor as the provisional budget.
Disappointment and utility
The finance minister, Eduard Janota has spoke about his disappointment and failure, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has added that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to resign should the proposed amendments be accepted, the situation would look completely different.
According to Czech TV, Janota has made an appointment to meet the Prime Minister on Monday after the session.
At the same time, he added that he was rethinking his position in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment in the budget talks.
If Fischer commits to continue the fight against the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the appointees who carry through the budget amendments have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should clearly state that he will resign if the House approves other laws that could increase the deficit, such as sick pay, pensions or the amendment to the Civil Servants Act for example.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed to the ODS have committed no offence
This is a matter for the Minister of State Fischer and the whole government.
Ministry appointed to the ODS have done nothing wrong, stressed Topolánek in a text report from USA.
The minister pointed to several ministries in under-secretary posts who support TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer chooses to resign on the basis of the fight against the public finance deficit, it is totally logical and correct that he falls back on the left majority in the House.
If he does not have the support and tolerance of the civil democrats, he would not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the civil democrats.
However, I have not thought about it, and I will concentrate on that when I get the time, according to the House of Representatives.
This afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels to attend a European Council meeting.
ODS stands down at the request of the Prime Minister
Nečas also stressed that the ODS would have voted against the amended budget if the Prime Minister had not explicitly asked the civil democrats to allow the budget to be approved.
ODS does not look like orphans, we are not little children, was how he reacted to the question of whether the ODS was not hampered by the presence of the party chairman in the parliament and in Czech Republic during the political negotiations regarding the budget.
I did not notice that my vote was missing.
The next months would see the Bolshevisation of the House and the destruction of all positive, Topolánek himself added.
The new Czech Railways timetable shows that fewer trains will be running for almost the same fares.
From December 13, Czech Railways will be cancelling or restricting some less frequent express and local trains, but will add more services to other lines.
The new timetable will be implemented on the day the new timetable becomes in force, and there will be two percent less services compared with now.
Most fares, including basic and special tickets, will stay the same.
More links to the capital will be available, for example, to people in Ostrava region, as the railways are adding one Pendolino to that line.
However, the express will stop running to Bratislava.
The number of express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice route will be reduced, and the direct service from Prague - Letohrad will be cut dramatically.
The region planning the most transport cuts is the Region of Hradec Králové, with a total cut of eight percent, but Prague and the surrounding area can expect to see a rise.
The Prague - Tábor - Czech Republic line is also being cut, and several express services on the Prague - Písek - Czech Republic route will be reduced to a few days a week.
The most important change is the introductory of the new direct line from Milovice to Prague, as people now travelling from Milovice have to change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifth line in the Esko suburban system, which can now be open since the track from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice has been fully electrified.
Long distance services to the capital will end at the Prague Hlavní nádraží station.
Czech Railways is introducing more Pendolino routes between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run on two hour intervals.
From December 13, passengers will no longer be able to take Pendolino to Bratislava.
This year's cost of regional railways: 200 million more
Railway trains are ordered and paid for by the Transport Ministry, and next year it will give the railways four billion crowns to cover demonstrable losses, while about three billion will be contributed by the state.
This year, regional trains are costing 200 million more.
Czech Railways have signed a new ten-year contract for local and express trains, whereas previously the contract was only for one year.
The railways have appreciated the system, despite the fact that most of the fares have not been increased.
Only change is ČD Net one-day network tickets and eLiška cheap internet tickets.
Travellers without a customer card will find that the ČD Net price has changed from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The eLiška price will now depend on the distance travelled, where previously it was a flat rate of 160 crowns to travel between any regional city.
Filipino gunmen still holding more than 50 people, children have been released
Today, gunmen in the south of the Philippines kidnapped 75 people, including several primary school students and teachers.
This from AFP agency, which originally announced only 65 abducted persons.
All 17 of the captured children, together with their teacher, were released after eight hours.
The kidnapper was kidnapped in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Around 19 gunmen are apparently using the hostages as human shield in their escape from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to arrange the release of the remaining prisoners.
The gunmen are part of the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed force of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police initially started hunting the kidnappers after violence that occurred as accounts were settled between two local family clans.
In the province of Maguindanao, in the south of the Philippines, martial law has been declared after the recent mass killing that left 57 people dead.
The victims of the November 23rd mass murder, which was related to the governor’s election, included 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern province has been arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, together with his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family.
Muslim separatists are also active on Mindanao.
Then on Tuesday, the separatists re-renewed peace talks with the Filipino government.
The story of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela.
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Invictus by Clint Eastwood will hit American cinemas, which shows part of the life of the former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid advocate is taken on by Morgan Freeman, who was apparently chosen years ago by Mandela himself for his talent.
The supporting role of the legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar is played by Matt Damon.
With film in cinemas critics and the public are involved.
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18th, 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk.
The President of South Africa was elected from 1994 to 1999.
The expectations were high as he appeared in public at a time when not only was South Africa preparing for the World Cup, but the media was also rife with reports of increasing racial hatred and discrimination by the black majority.
The AP news agency says the response to the new film has been generally positive in South Africa, despite the number of objections to "brat-pack Hollywood stars" being cast in the main roles.
However, despite what he says, Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I have dreamed about this role for many years and prepared well.
When I meet Nelson Mandela many times to draw on his energy, he told an interview after the film's grand premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it is good that we can celebrate Mandela and his mission in a film.
It is a story about South Africa, but it affects everyone, he added.
In the national rugby team uniform
The film, based on the book by the British writer John Carlin, “Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation,” shows the South African human rights activist during his first presidential campaign.
In the film, Morgan Freeman tries to unite the two races and the populations that have been so long divided and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, appears in the film in the South African national rugby uniform at the World Cup match, which was won by South Africa.
The appearance in the kit, which is almost sacred symbol in South Africa, fourteen years ago, Mandela received a standing ovation from the mostly white spectators and gained the confidence of the white people.
Maybe a football championship can actually bring people together as one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only black person on the national team.
The tense situation in South Africa is only now being apparent.
White South Africa players are hesitant, as rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who left the country to go to Britain, told LN in a recent interview for LN.
The championship starts on June 11th, 2010.
Tesla transformer worth tens of millions of crowns burns in Louny region
In the morning a fire broke out in a transformer owned by Čeps at the switching station in the village of Výškov, near Louny.
Six fire engines took part in the fight, according to the spokesman for the Ústí regional firefighters, Lukáš Marvan.
The firefighters wanted to let the transformer burn, but later changed their minds and are now fighting the fire with a mix of water, foam, and special fire-suppressing agents.
The fire was caused by technical fault, a short circuit inside the transformer.
Nobody was hurt, and according to company spokesperson Pavla Mandátová, the incident will not affect the safe operation of the distribution station.
The damage is estimated to be several tens of millions of crowns, but the exact figure will not be known until the fire has been extinguished.
Mandátová says that the transformer will have to be replaced with a new one.
The nurse added that nothing like this has ever happened in the ten years that Čeps has been operating, and this kind of fault was a one-off.
According to ČEZ spokeswoman for northern Bohemia, Sonia Holingerová Hendrychová, no power cuts occurred and households, offices and companies were not affected by the transformer fire.
In Czech Republic, the joint stock company Čeps is the exclusive operator of transmission systems and 400 kV and 220 kV power lines.
It maintains, restore and develops 39 switching stations with 67 transformers converting electricity from the transmission system to the distribution system, and 4339 kilometres of power lines.
Jančura files a slander suit against three ČSSD commissioners
The owner of Student Agency, Radim Jančura, will today file a slander suit against three social democrat commissioners.
The following are Michal Hašek, South Moravia Commissioner, Radko Martínek, Pardubice Commissioner and Martin Tesařík.
Jancura announced this in the Twenty Minutes programme on Radiožurnal.
The suit relates to the company's attempts to operate regional trains in certain regions.
All regions eventually signed a long-term contract with Czech Railways.
The three Commissioners are attacking us and saying that we are getting the best out of it, while the offer we presented was just what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true, as we know the Czech Railways prices that were completed last week.
So all we can do is defend ourselves.
It is for slander against Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnal.
The chairman also told him that he has evidence from all regional authorities that they did not act in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing a motion for the European Commission.
Hašek sees the suit as a continuation of Mr Jančura's great media show, which works as a free advertisement for him and his company.
It is understandable that I am prepared to defend my good name and that of my region, and I call on the other Commissioners to do the same.
It is expected that this matter will clearly show that it is Mr Jančura who is manipulating the public over regional rail transport and using lies and false arguments, Hašek added.
The latter announced that he is investing several million crowns in advertising to draw attention to these inappropriate actions by the regional authorities.
The campaign was being stopped for Christmas and would start in New Year.
The campaign defined corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions decided to operate regional rail links with Czech Railways and had not announced tenders for the order, worth around 150 billion crowns.
Jančura says this is illegal and contrary to the European Court of Justice.
Jančura claims that his criticism of regional rail transport has already led to his threats from a member of the Czech Socialist Party.
The only threat was that if we do not stop this, we could lose our bus licence.
The person he introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD is known to be but I will not mention his name.
Pneumococcus vaccinations will be free and voluntary.
January 1, pneumococcal vaccinations will radically change ingrained habits.
This should be the first free yet voluntary vaccination for families.
However, some are believed that compulsory vaccinations would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free anti-pneumococcus vaccinations are reaching peak.
The pharmaceutical Institute is already setting the maximum price for vaccines to be paid by health insurance companies.
Experts now know how to proceed with the vaccinations.
New vaccines
Free vaccinations for children born in August
Starting January, free pneumococcal vaccinations for children born on or after August 2nd.
The condition is that they have not received any prior vaccinations.
Anyone who began to be vaccinated last year or earlier will have to pay for any later revaccinations.
The first batch of vaccinations must be given when the child is between 3 and 5 months old.
Last year, one in four families took their children for voluntary pneumococcal vaccination.
Parents paid 1600 crowns or more per vaccination.
The youngest children require four vaccinations.
Overall, health insurance companies spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns a year on vaccinations.
Save on the treatment that unvaccinated children would otherwise need.
The state has been paying around 500 thousand crowns a year for general vaccinations for children.
Subsidised vaccinations were introduced in the Janota package.
Pneumococcus causes infection of the middle ear, but also serious infections of the brain membranes and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections claim the lives of up to 28 children under the age of ten every year, according to hospital figures.
In addition to Czech Republic, around 40 countries have introduced general anti-pneumococcus vaccinations for children.
Should vaccinations be compulsory?
Some believe that in the future these vaccinations could be compulsory.
As of January, they must be paid by the insurance companies and not compulsory.
The head of the Nahlas civil association, Rudolf Kalovský, says that compulsory vaccinations are better.
The association has long been promoting pneumococcal vaccines.
The specialists at the international conference that our association attended were not very happy to hear that we have voluntary vaccinations.
It is not completely ideal.
The other hand, we are happy that we managed to get at least these voluntary vaccinations in place.
This is the route we have to take, says Kalovský.
The Health Minister does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination system.
We are not considering it at this time, according to Ministry of Health spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccinations have their drawbacks, say doctors
The Chairwoman of the Professional Society of Paediatricians, Hana Cabrnochová, recognises that voluntary vaccinations have their drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, the number of revaccinations could then be reduced.
Scientists expect that, starting next year, more than 80% of new parents will get their babies vaccinated against pneumococcus.
Anti-pneumococcus vaccinations are a major milestone in that they are the first general vaccinations for children paid by insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should fund prevention to save money on later treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy vaccines themselves.
However, practising pediatricians are concerned when buying the vaccines.
The original plan called for the purchase of vaccines by insurance companies, and doctors would receive them in the same way that the state issues drugs for other vaccinations.
Some ministers are concerned that the insurance companies could "run wild with health insurance funds".
The doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until the insurance companies refund the money.
The estimate is that pediatric professionals will have to spend 40 thousand a month on vaccines, which is a lot of money.
It certainly won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.
US artist's son 'in museum theft'
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta, has been charged with trying to steal $20m (£12m) from his father’s museum.
Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
The investigation says Mr Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr Frazetta Snr, aged 81, is known for his depiction of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The artist was in Florida at the time of the incident, the Associated Press news agency reported.
The AP quoted an unnamed police official as having been involved in a family feud.
The police affidavit said Mr Frazetta Jr, 52, was instructed to "enter the museum by any means necessary to move all the paintings to a storage facility", the agency reported.
Mr Frazetta Snr denied any such permission, the agency said.
Labour defends budget tax rises
Ministers have defended the tax rises and spending cuts announced in the pre-Budget report against criticism from the opposition, business and unions.
The Tories said Alistair Darling "blew an opportunity to show he was serious about reducing the deficit by delaying decisions until after the election.
The Chief Executive was also hit by low and middle income workers.
The main proposals include a 0.5% rise in National Insurance and a 1% cap on public pay settlement from 2011.
National Insurance complaint
Unions have protested that low-paid workers are being penalized for a recession not their own and warned of "problems" ahead.
The National Insurance increase - which will raise about £3bn a year - has been a thorn in the business community, which says it is a tax on jobs when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than £20,000 a year, will hit about 10 million workers.
Key Points of PBR
National Insurance up by 0.5% from April 2011
Economy to shrink by worse than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bank bonuses
1p rise in corporation tax for small firms scrapped
Taxes for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension to rise by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, someone earning £30,000 will be £90 a year worse off and someone on £40,000 will be £190 worse off.
They called the target of halving the deficit by 2013 difficult decisions, but stressed that 60% of the burden of extra taxes would fall on the top 5% of earners.
The Treasury minister Stephen Timms denied the proposals were a drop in the ocean compared to what was needed.
The large numbers will deliver for us this halving of the deficit which is essential over the next four years.
The economist believed the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
However, Labour forecasts for future economic growth - which will influence the amount it has to borrow and how quickly it can cut his deficit - have been questioned after the chancellor forced to revise earlier figures.
In his statement, he said the economy would contract 4.75% this year - far worse than the 3.5% forecast in April.
'Blown opportunity'
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday warning of Labour's "debt crisis", said they believed the debt crisis was unsustainable.
Mnisters had failed to lay out a credible plan for how they would pay this back, which must be held by June 2010.
They have not included anything of significance they are going to do, shadow Treasury minister Philip Hammond.
" All important announcements will come after the election, whoever wins it "
Roger Booth, Deloitte
Labour believe that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts unlike Tory proposals which would see the deficit cut faster and further.
The Lib Dems said the money raised by tax rises and spending cuts would be used to support spending next year, acknowledging the plans were "built on sand".
The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson said some of the timing of the announcements - such as the above inflation increase in some disability benefits next April - would leave the chancellor open to accusations of electioneering as the money may be simply clawed back the year after.
However, Labour says the extra help is provided when people need it most and the situation will be assessed in September 2010.
Phoney budget
Although ministers do not publish spending details for beyond 2011, economists said the squeeze on public spending would only start to bite in the medium term.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies believed the chairman's figures could mean substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence.
It is really holding off pain until later, said its Director Robert Chote.
The most important announcements will come after the election, whoever wins it.
This has been the phoney pre-Budget report. The markets realise this.
FBI investigates 'US Pakistan arrests'
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five reported US men with suspicion of extremist links.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda in eastern Punjab province, Pakistan's US embassy told the BBC.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who were reported missing from their homes in Virginia last month.
The US State Department said it was also seeking information on the men.
Three of them are reported to be of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni background.
If they are American citizens, we are going to be very interested in the charges they have been detained on and in what circumstances they are held.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
They are working with Pakistan authorities to identify their identities and the nature of their business there.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to an uncle of one of them.
The house was already of interest to local police and no charges were yet filed against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, but added that the US needed to work closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.
The five students were reported missing from their homes in northern Virginia by their families in late November.
Amnesty condemns Iran 'abuses'
Human rights in Iran are as poor as any other time in the past 20 years, according to a report from Amnesty International.
The report details "patterns of abuse" by the regime before and after disputed presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another was threatened with rape.
Iran has dismissed previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials have said such criticism is politically motivated.
thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran after the disputed election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest street protest since 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been given prison terms, and authorities say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
The BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyen, who is now in London, says that early in the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, accepted some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
Then, there has been almost no tolerance of criticism by the authorities, our correspondent says.
'False confession'
Amnesty International cited the account of 26-year-old computing student Ebrahim Mehtari, who was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the result.
Then he was quoted as saying.
"I was smoked under my eyes, neck, head... They threatened to kill me and humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and was taken out and left in the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, defeated president Mehdi Karroubi reported some protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
Iranian officials denied the rape claims, but admitted that abuses had occurred.
Amnesty also cites the case of a former detainee who reported he was held in a container with 75 others for more than eight weeks at a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty accepted that the Iranian parliament and judiciary had established committees to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response, but it said the mandate and powers of the committees were unclear and the parliamentary committee's findings were not publicised.
The group said at least 90 people have been arrested in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes are created in city park.
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to transform a Bristol landmark into a competition piste.
The Piste in Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snow borders competing for cash prizes.
The top of the slope in Brandon Hill park there was a short jump ramp before a 100m-long slope.
The third year medical student John Hickman said the view was lovely but it was a bit difficult.
It's a beautiful view with all city lights below all twinkling.
There are some of the best skiers and snow borders in the county - some real talent.
awards were awarded for the best tricks - or manoeuvres performed on the slopes.
After Thursday evening's event the snow will be left to melt.
Still them and us
Islam is French?
Pluralism and Pragmatism in a Secularist State.
A time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on minarets and there is widespread debate about the supposed Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written an informed and measured account of how Muslims can integrate—and are forming in one of Europe’s most avowedly secular societies.
The author’s new book will be a tribute to his last work, "Why the French Do Not Like Headscarves" (2006), a brilliant and closely argued study of an issue that has divided and moved the country for a decade and half, and which still has effects today.
The new book is broader and more ambitious.
As an anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media are talking about Islam in France, but what is actually happening on the ground.
The mosques, schools and institutes now provide France’s 5m-6m Muslims with what Mr Bowen calls “Islamic spaces”.
The speaker is a good listener, reproducing debate between teachers and students about the questions they most concern.
Should a Muslim get married in a mosque or town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and gay rights?
Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is seemingly mundane issues, he argues, that are the stuff of daily life rather than the political dramas that surround the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them household names, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how to be both good Muslim and good citizen in a modern secular society.
The argument is not going all the way.
Conservatives are suspicious of the very idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists whom Mr Bowen interviews tend to be at odds with their Salafi counterparts—advocates of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia—who now have a small but important presence in Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
Accommodation requires give and take on both sides.
The question is how far French policymakers (and the intellectual elite that so proudly guard laïcité) are really committed to pluralism.
The theory suggests that Muslims are probably getting a raw deal than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic compromises with secular republicanism.
However, instead of growing pragmatism, he detects a "tightening of the value-screws".
If Islam is French, one is inclined to say, “Yes but not yet.”
The bleedingest world view
Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environment on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting with alarming speed, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
Fuel, gas, shipping and fishing interests have been heading into the newly open water with diplomats, lawyers, and now authors.
In “On Thin Ice” Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the north’s icon, the polar bear.
The author is well versed in the complicated history and politics of whaling, and describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by taking on the white bear.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter as a plucky 14-year-old midshipman fighting only with his butt of his musket is surely a myth, but others are true.
Young bears, captured as they swam after the bodies of their newly killed mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
One early 20th century big-top act featured 75 polar bears at once.
The zoo enclosures are still typically a millionth of the area of a wild adult’s range.

Ellis draws on other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat posed by hunters to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and skidoo-riding Inuit Indians both use high-powered assault rifles to bring down their quarry.
The ice will last for most long in the waters north of those two hunting nations.
After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, gives a clear and chilling account of the science of the Arctic and a stunning glimpse into how the future may look.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Both atmospheric scientists and oceanographers cannot adequately account for the speed of the change.
It is not for wanting to try.
Fridjof Nansen’s pioneering journeys in the mid-19th century and early 20th century first hinted at the ice pack warming.
Cold War submarines then took the shifting ridges running under it.
Satellites and large arrays of iceberg-mounted probes are useful additions, but much is still done by hardy individuals kept out in the cold.
The remarkable, tiny world of the tributary system within the Arctic ice, formed by trickles of briny water which squeezes as it freezes.
The bear above to the microscopic wonders within, all doom once the summer ice goes, which is expected to occur somewhere between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months...this could be us'
Marines among 6,000 who place wreaths on graves in Arlington
Pfc. DeAngelo Robinson, 19, travelled seven hours by bus to place a single wreath on the tomb of a soldier whom he never saw.
The day was about remembering men and women who once walked in their shoes.
In a few months, from where we are getting shipped out, this could be us, said Robinson of the fallen soldiers.
If it is us, I would like somebody to do the same for me so I am just trying to show respect.
The volunteer was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to place wreaths on veterans' gravesites across several sections of the Arlington Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, began the event when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred gravesites at Arlington Ceremony.
Their wife Karen takes the trip every year to host events dedicated to the people in the military and terrorists.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit, Wreaths Across America, which has spread the event across several states.
The year started with more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at Arlington Cemetery, areas at the Pentagon, Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shankssville, Pennsylvania.
The second year, Walmart Foundation donated $150,000 to purchase, and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she took the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a career military man.
While her husband is not buried at Arlington, Hunt said this was her way of giving back to those who made sacrifices.
It is a small way civilians can support our troops, she added.
It's like visiting a family gravesite.
Layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked across the huge lawn and hills.
Volunteers targeted older tombs from World War I, World War II and Vietnam because they are not visited as often as newer graves, organizers said.
The mood was upbeat as children play and couples held hands while carrying the fresh pine to the graying tombstones.
The circular wreath was a deep green with a small red bow on the top.
Near, Section 60, where most veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained virtually silent.
United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate the section but the harsh mood of current wars filled the area.
Individuals openly weeped, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the cold air.
They read aloud names in the stone, and others bowed to see small black and white place cards pushed inside wet mud for those whose tombstones are yet to be completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers wiping tears from her eyes in front of her son's grave.
The wife took eight hours to visit the gravesite of Marine Gunnery Sgt David Shane Spicer who died in combat in July.
Nobody should ever forget why we are free. . . my son paid for that, she said.
"When I'm long gone, I want someone to remember him."
US government contractor arrested by Cuban officials
The Cuban government has arrested a US government contractor who was distributing cellphones and laptop computers in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the US Agency for International Development and World Bank.
Foreign officers with the US Interest Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested Dec. 5.
The specific charges are not publicised, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor can be arrested for nearly anything under the claim of "dangerousness."
All counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical writing, are at risk of arrest.
Antigovernment graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
The fledging blogging community is led by the popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has repeatedly applied for permission to leave the country to accept awards but has been denied permission.
The detention of an American contractor may likely raise tensions between the Castro brothers Communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been pursuing a "go-slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported by New York Times Friday night.
The new US policy states that if Cuba takes concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, the United States will reciprocate.
Phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, but they are new and attractive commodities in a country where the average wage of a government worker is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy cellphones this year, mainly for texting, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost up to a day's income.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and to foreign visitors there, and at some government outlets such as universities.
Cubans who want to log on often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many Web sites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press officer at the US Interests Section in Havana.
Bebena could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
New Castro, Same Cuba
Vivanco said that the accused are often arrested, tried and prisoned in a day.
The latter added that any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provokes negative reaction in the United States as the two countries begin to move towards more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unraveling plot to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday took a look at the alleged mastermind of a Northern Virginia men sent to Afghanistan to kill US troops, adding that the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters who search the Internet for radicalized young men.
They were hunting for a shadowy figure known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one made comments approving terror attacks on Internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah guided the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt that is home to al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
The Pakistani Intelligence official who was briefed on the case said that Saifullah was unsuccessful in convincing the al-Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
The prisoners were kept for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the north that have become a terrorist haven.
The operation was considered as a sting operation.
The petitions were rejected, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the case.
The official said the men were still trying to acquire the right endorsements to access the al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of the five remaining in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determining who can be trusted.
Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, US Intelligence has made it a top priority to try to place human assets inside al-Qaeda.
The organization's recruiters act as gatekeepers, keeping out those who are not serious about their faith in the Holy War and those who could be spies.
The would-be American recruits are treated by al-Qaeda with special scrutiny, analysts said.
The latter are considered to be enormously appealing to the group because of their potential to access U.S. targets and because of their propaganda value.
The intelligence agency has also become much more aware of who they allow in because the US intelligence agencies have become more experts in recruiting methods.
If you are trying to sink someone into these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
The model is one that has become far more Web-based.
Climate 'action' calls for Copenhagen thousands
Numerous thousands of protesters marched on the streets here Saturday, demanding bigger action on climate from the negotiators working inside the city's Bella Convention Center.
They claimed as many 100,000 people participated in the event, but police estimate the number was close to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, though a handful of masked activists set off small explosives near a group of government buildings in downtown.
On a day when little was known about the U.N.-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked across the city holding banners in English declaring "There is No Planet B" and one in Spanish declaring, "The Earth is Saying, 'Enough.'
Various celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to Peru made her aware of the heartbreaking issues the country is going through due to climate change.
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the big march - to pass on the word and to appeal to the world's leaders to deliver a fair, ambitious and binding deal, she added.
It is not easy, but it must be done, no way around it anymore.
The police kept the protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and arrested 19 people, mainly because they had either wore masks or carried pocket knives.
The activities are prohibited during demonstrations under Danish law.
According to one observer, who asked not to be identified, activists wearing masks and black outfits set off several explosives near Copenhagen main canal, which is close to several ministries.
The flares started as flares but followed by "a couple big explosions."
In the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
The protest did not seem to penetrate key officials such as Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if the demonstration had a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "Actually, that is something I was not aware of."
Then he continued in Mandarin, adding, "Because the venue is large, I cannot hear what is happening outside."
The assessment was that whether the march was hurting or helping depends on one's perspective.
It shows the concentration of the general public and different sectors on climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "They also disrupt the negotiations or the freedom of other people.
Test data reveal stubborn racial gaps
The last week’s federal report on math achievement was a welcome piece of good news for D.C. public schools.
The report card showed fourth- and eighth-graders making progress at a faster pace than cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
The most persistent gap between African American and white students both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white D.C. fourth graders over the past two years changed from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but their African American counterparts' rose by three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap actually spread between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
African American progress in eighth grade remained essentially flat, dropping a statistically insignificant one point, from 245 to 244.
Average white scores were not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture across a six-year stretch is not more encouraging.
The gap between white and black fourth graders in 2003 was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
Although the scores of children in both groups have increased over this period, the difference has only limited to 58.
The Education Advocacy Centre in the District expressed concern last week that the achievements of the Chief Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were fueled by white students who are already high achievers.
The aggregate is a problematic and troublesome situation, according to Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates for educational equality in the District.
When I am talking about two- or three-point spread, I am not jumping up and down about it, said Council member Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in fourth grade at Eaton Elementary.
The latest evidence of the test scores is that the city's middle schools are in need of attention.
Always look for the plus signs, and I respect that.
What's scary is we are not spending nearly the time and energy we need to spend on our middle schools.
Rhea added that the District needs to continue to find better ways to address low-income students.
This fall, some teachers are training to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, targeting students in the upper elementary and middle school grades who did not master the basics of reading early in their school career and are significantly behind their peers.
Everyday Mathematics, a K- through sixth grade math curriculum emphasizing games and real life experiences, is credited with some of the progress reported last week.
However, I think we have to keep working on bringing the best interventions to those students who are below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that the results of the NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to lift the overall performance of the system and still provide the additional money and resources for low-performing schools that will be needed to close the gap.
The Michelle Rhee dilemma is a sort of rough-edged dilemma, according to Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California at Berkeley who studies urban test scores.
The conventional policy remedy is to target your resources and management reform on schools located in the poorest parts of D.C.
The targeting may produce political consequences that go against that important agenda.
The rub is like other urban supervisors, she is trying to keep on with the white and black middle class.
Our focus is on building a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, are confident that their children can get an excellent public education.
Jennifer Janey, now the new chief of schools in Newark, told a recent interview that one essential element to close the gap is to extend the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with charter schools.
The teachers' union agreed to a 185-day year, which he considers as a marker for further increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a part of more futures
The tour bus pulled into Gettysburg College with a loud wheeze.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stepped off and stood behind the white columns, brick facades and emerald lawn.
Graciela's parents had barely graduated from high school in El Salvador.
In recent years, Graciela, born in Silver Spring and living in Riverdale, has never been on a college campus.
However as she and the other eighth-graders in the group explored Gettysburg, where the tuition is $38,690 a year, their attitude was less like awe-struck visitors than of interested prospective students.
This is where I will be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they were entering the science building.
Really? she thought, when told of the low professor-to-student ratio.
The Pennsylvania college was the seventh the kids had visited on their three-day tour, and by now they have fully absorbed its message: The question is not whether you are going to college.
The question is where.
Although there is growing concern about the large number of U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or get pregnant as teenagers, there are also hundreds of thousands who are getting the college education they need to enter middle class.
In fact, one in five of these second generation Hispanics graduate from college, a significant achievement given that so many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without getting high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they point to a generation that will play an outsize role in the country's workforce.
The highest achievers often have natural affinity for school and an innate drive to succeed.
Many parents set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their unfamiliarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play an important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her make it to college, particularly if they are sustained over time.
When you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to navigate through the system, any single intervention at any one time is not going to solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a research researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has studied Latino students.
We need to think about providing supportive networks for these children from preschool all the way on through high school.
The federal program that funded Graciela's college tour is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to run college prep programs that begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they finish high school.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent of which graduate to college, according to the US Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches deals with 10 foreign oil companies
Although violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in two auctions that took place Saturday.
The 10 deals the Iraqi Oil Ministry has reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil firms are ready to play a major role in refurbishing Iraq's oil industry, which has been damaged by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies walked away with stakes in two of the 10 auctioned field.
Seven American companies paid to participate in the second auction, which starts Friday.
The only one that submitted a bid lost.
Two American companies reached deals for fields auctioned in June.
The lack of American oil giants in Iraq's opening oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of US companies you have Asian and European companies leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news outlet.
It will be long before anything else will be offered in Iraq.
Fears of security, underlined by mass coordinated bombings Tuesday, and political instability as the US military withdraws, likely prevented American oil companies from going more forcefully into Iraq, which has the world's third-largest proven crude reserves, analysts said.
However, US firms were in some cases at a disadvantage because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy firms, have significantly lower labor costs and are more prone to risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that reached deals with the ministry.
Important US firms such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have cultivated close ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and have provided technical advice in recent years, walked away empty-handed.
Ukrainian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the top stakeholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
State-owned China National Petroleum Corp. bid on more contracts than any other company and walked away with large stakes in two major fields.
All know that China is on the way to become a major economic and technological power, Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said.
The Chinese company is confident that it will be on par with its competitors and will fulfil its Iraqi obligations.
Companies selected to submit bids made offers that were then compared to the per barrel fee the ministry was willing to pay for boosting output above current levels at each field.
Top al-Qaeda planner apparently killed in Pakistan
The apparent US missile strike along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan has believed to have killed a top al-Qaeda operations planner this week, US counterterrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second death-causing attack against a senior terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men thought to have been killed when a pair of missiles hit them Tuesday in North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
The missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type operated by the CIA inside Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
The two were driving in a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit by a helicopter, according to an official with Pakistan's civil intelligence agency.
The official said suspected local militants rushed to the spot and quickly confiscated what was left of the dead.
They were unable to verify the identities of the dead, but two US counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a senior al-Qaeda military planner who ran the terrorist group's operations outside Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
The senior official was involved in plotting worldwide, which cited the sensitive nature of US airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given his central role, this probably included plotting attacks against the United States and Europe.
The operative guidance was taken from the top leadership of the al-Qaeda leadership and translated it into operational blueprints for potential terrorist attacks.
The second US official said Somali had quickly become a member of al-Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
The name may not be familiar to some Americans, but that does not reduce the threat he posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If Somali is confirmed, Somali would be the second senior al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar strike killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal belt, and three other top operatives.
The pace of strikes by CIA-run drones has declined since summer, from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to a report from the Long War Journal, a Web site managed by a non-profit group.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerabilities while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site said.
Top U.N. envoy in Kabul to step down
The United Nations' top envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would step down from his position in March, ending a tumultuous tenure that was marked by widespread corruption in Afghanistan's U.N.-backed presidential election.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send additional US troops to Afghanistan.
The US envoy said that he supports the surge but expressed concern that the US timetable for a military drawdown starting in 18 months would prompt other NATO countries to withdraw their forces.
The priority is to accelerate the buildup of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants aiding Afghanistan's political transition.
The surge on the military side must be copied on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning but simply fulfilling his family’s promise to spend only two years in Kabul.
The notice was sent to the U.N.
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is now ready to take his place so that he would have time to find a replacement.
What I have said is that you better start looking for a successor, Eide said.
Then I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
WHO has begun searching for a replacement, according to U.N. officials.
The officials say he has been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian national who recently headed the U.N. mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led U.N. peacekeeping operations.
Eide's standing in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and of covering evidence of mass electoral fraud.
Eide denied the allegations but said the accusations by Galbraith "certainly damaged the mission, because there was already a great degree of skepticism about international interference in the election.
Eide proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate relief efforts by the US-led forces in Afghanistan.
The leadership also asked the United States and other Western countries to allow more staff from the USA and other Western countries that donated to the Afghan mission, adding to the confidence that they are being properly used.
Eide expressed frustration with the limitations on his capacity in Afghanistan, says that harsh U.N. hiring regulations restrict his ability to attract talent.
The U.N. rules are such that I have only been able to recruit one person since May, he added.
It is tragic and cannot continue.
Gates: Iran to face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran over its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Secretary of State Bill Gates, speaking to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a weeklong tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, played down the prospect of military action against the Islamic republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said in response to a question from a soldier about the likelihood of such development.
One of the things I ponder is that if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of the sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
The chairman added that "a package of incentives and disincentives" would be needed to convince Iran government that they are less secure with nuclear weapons, because "their people will suffer enormously from sanctions.
In a statement Friday by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in warning Iran that it will face "credible consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the U.N. Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on Oct. 1, it announced that it would return to talks on nuclear restraint and agree to give up substantial portion of its enriched uranium stockpile in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has called for such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two sides and to buy time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran has appeared to have walked away from the tentative deals, mainly because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether to engage with the United States.
Because Iran's stiffing the international community on some of the proposals that they actually agreed to at the beginning of October has brought the international community together in a way that has not been before in terms of significant additional sanctions on Iranians, Gates said.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has set a Dec. 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals before he goes on to review other options, including using what Clinton once called "crippling sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, Iran's Mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "baseless and unfounded claims" Thursday by some Security Council members about Iran's nuclear activities and said it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers to achieve an appropriate long-term solution.
Following his return to Washington, Gates will meet with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before flying to Iraq's oil-rich Kurdish region for meetings with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Conflicts remain high between the Kurds and Iraq's Arab majority, particularly over boundaries, property rights and revenue sharing.
Both sides urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to prevent any delays in the US plan to cut the number of American troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by August.
officials quoted Gates as telling Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon you.
In aging China, course change
Wang Weijia and her husband growing up surrounded by propaganda posters teaching them that Mother Earth is too tired to sustain more children" and "One more baby means one more tomb.
The lesson was so well learned that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by their low birthrate and aging population, abruptly changed course and started encouraging young couples to have more than one child, they immediately replied: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy for just one child.
We have no left for second, said Wang, 31, a human resources administrator with a 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after China's one child policy was introduced, creating two generations of notoriously chubby, spoiled only children nicknamed "little emperors," a population crisis is looming in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple compared with six when the policy was implemented, according to the U.N.
While the number of residents 60 and older is predicted to increase from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1% by 2050, that is far above the global average of about 20 percent.
The balance is worse in wealthy coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
The percentage of people 60 and older accounts for almost 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, and the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, has stressed that fertile couples need to have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and reduce a workforce shortage in the future."
Shanghai is about to be "as old as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she added.
A gradually easing
The country's constitution was written into the country in 1978, and China's one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and discrimination at work.
Officials have credited the policy with helping the country avoid critical strain on its natural resources, while human rights advocates have denounced abuses in its implementation of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced women pregnant with second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had sex-selective abortions, resulting in unnaturally high male-to-female ratios.
In recent years, population officials have gradually softened their stance on one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, minority groups and cases where both husband and wife have only children, and in 2007, they took down many of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Peking University, said central government officials have recently been debating radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is only a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Soon, posters advising families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be eligible to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet with couples in their homes and slip leaflets under doors.
It has also committed to providing emotional and financial counseling to those who have more than one child.
The response has been underwhelming, family planning officials say.
Response was disappointing
Although officials in one rural town on outskirts of Shanghai report a rise in applications from couples wanting a second child after the campaign, the more urban districts report no change.
Huinan township, with a population of 115,000, still receives about four to five applications a month.
However, despite the campaign, the number of births in Shanghai in 2010 is still expected to be about 165,000, a slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai's Caolu township, said financial considerations are probably the main reason many people do not want more children.
The first one wants to give the best to their first, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and are legally allowed to do so.
However, like many Chinese, they only have the limited medical and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social safety net, the choice would be irresponsible.
People in West wrongly view one-child policy as a right, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
Yes, we are being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
The problem is not just policy.
money is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for hesitate.
Because she was one, she wanted an only child because she was one with her family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to taking care of and do not really want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, took it more harshly.
For dual-career, middle-class parents who are bringing down the birth rate, he added, it's about being successful enough to be selfish.
Today's 20- and 30-somethings grew up seeing their parents struggle during the early days of China's experiment with capitalism and do not want that life for themselves, he said.
Even one child requires huge demands on parents' time, he said.
Mothers must give up at least two years of social life.
Then there are the space issues -- "You have to renovate your apartment" -- and the strategic planning -- "You have to have a résumé ready by the time the child is 9 months old for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to deal with this once, but not twice.
Ours are the first generation with higher living standards, he added.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
U.N. group drafts plan to reduce emissions
The U.N.-sponsored climate conference, which has been characterised by unruly posturing and mutual recriminations, has gained renewed focus Friday with the release of a document outlineing ambitious greenhouse-gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized countries shouldering most of the burden in the near term.
The text, which could provide a final political deal to control greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles as well as it outlined a path forward.
It was seen as an important advance in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
The text is silent on how much money rich countries would give poor people to cope with global warming over the short and long term.
The report provides a range of options for the key questions, including how developed and emerging economies could cut their carbon output, and what would be the upper limit of global temperature rise that policymakers would allow.
Flexible processes are a good way to carry out the process, said John Coequyt, senior Washington representative for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, focused on the big picture.
The outlines for a possible deal, which would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries would cut emissions by 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union gave the talks a boost on Friday by pledging to provide $3.6 billion a year for poorer countries to adapt to climate change, from coping with flood and drought to prevent deforestation.
Still, Friday featured the same sort of verbal fireworks that have dominated the talks for the past week.
Todd Stern rejected language requiring binding cuts of greenhouse-gas emissions for industrialized countries compared with voluntary ones by emerging economies if funded by the developed world.
The move signals that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China than Bush administration officials did two years ago.
The United States is not going to do a deal without the major developing countries stepping up and taking action, Stern added.
Stern made his comments a hour after China's vice foreign minister He Yafei said America's top climate negotiator was either lacking common sense or extremely irresponsible for saying that the United States would not help China to cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's major powers at stake, faultlines have erupted both within the developing world and between industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is as much about individual economies as saving the planet, with China and the USA fighting over their respective obligations, while poorer countries argue that the world's two dozen most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should be responsible for curbing greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in trying to hold the major emitters accountable for their action.
This is clearly a game where new economic hegemony is being developed, according to Ulate, who also serves as the regional Mexico and Central America climate change adviser for Conservation International.
The most vulnerable countries to climate change stressed they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, but most major participants believe they will produce a political deal at best.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, produced a 24-page draft treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations has "put political pressure on the whole political process" in part because they are now unified and demanding action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on new urgency as delegates focus on the fact that most of the issues must be resolved before the government headquarters arrive to agree a deal.
Chief officials such as Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese vice minister stepped off planes and ran through the Bella Center's halls to closed-door meetings and news conferences to stake claims that will be closed in the next week.
The sheer size of the event -- where 13,000 people walk in and out of the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists play nightly shows mocking the countries they think are selling out, and draft proposals are hand-to-hand hand-to-hand written on paper rather than via email -- is a challenge.
The intensity is growing: nearly all key ministers are now here, and as early as Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are getting into the big leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain’s first 140mph train to redefine Monday feeling
At 5.13 on Monday morning a whistle will pierce the dark to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The first high speed commuter train in the country will reach 140mph as it streaks from Ashford, Kent to London St Pancras in 38 minutes.
Adonis, the Transport Secretary, will then join Dame Kelly Holmes on the first Javelin commuter service out of London.
The new service will eventually plug Britain into an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great conurbations of Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
Neglected backwaters would become growing commuter towns, business travel times would be reduced and the shift to the railroad would reduce national carbon emissions as well as reducing congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties agree with this vision.
The tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental harm may yet block the British high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the Government with feasibility study, will hand its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, The Times has learned.
It will provide him with a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to West Midlands will be drawn to within five metres in urban areas and sites where the environmental impact may be contentious.
In open country, the plan will be drafted to within 25 metres of a final route.
HS2 is also expected to set out three options for a wider high-speed network running north.
Adonis will respond in spring.
The most common option is a y-shaped configuration with one high-speed line running up to the West Midlands.
The line would split at or near Birmingham, with one branch running west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another running northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would run into Scotland.
It looks like it is going to be the best-performing option, a rail insider said.
After the successful completion of the journey, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first leg, which would not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to about an hour at present.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 250mph, making the UK network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is designed to take 400m long trains with capacity for 1,100 people.
As many as 18 could operate each hour on a London-Birmingham line.
The London terminal would require capacity of 20,000 passengers an hour.
Given space constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston have that potential.
Adonis will announce his opinions about the scheme, but long public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision would not be made until after a general election.
Even if he does drive the wheels, the network would have to be built in sections.
Trains would first have to run off high-speed lines to the existing rails north of Birmingham, keeping journey times between London and Scotland below three hours.
The crucial point of turning from planes to trains is seen as the crucial tipping point to ensure a switch from planes to trains, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Farmers meet with mortgage on Tory's £75,000 orangery
Alan Duncan, the frontbench Tory MP, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for his own orangery.
The party’s prisons spokesman, who was deemed to be a "ration spokesman", added his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak-framed extension to his second home in Rutland.
The IRS was allowed to charge the extra interest, totaling hundreds of pounds a month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities approved the claims at the time and they have not been queried by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of members’ expenses.
The wealthy Member of Parliament, Mr Duncan, is a two-storey house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
Near by houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fees office agreed that Mr Duncan needed more space.
The house was updated last year, which is described in plans as an orangery.
Neighbourhood describe it as a "glasshouse for entertaining".
The mortgage arangements were not reported to Mr Duncan in recent investigation by the Commons’ Standards and Privileges Committee into his previous mortgage arangements.
The Committee cleared him last month of breaching the rules after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004 Mr Duncan changed the legal security for a £271,406 mortgage from his London property to his constituency home, which he bought in 1991, the year before he became an MP.
Documents released this week show that Mr Duncan was claiming about £1,400 a month in mortgage interest.
In April, his claims reached more than £1,800 a month.
The interest rate on Mr Duncan’s RBS mortgage was not changed in that time, suggesting that all the increase was to fund the £75,000 borrowed.
The RBS standard variable mortgage rate went down from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year.
The latest document release by the Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan was continuing to claim £1,250 a month this May.
The Shadow Leader of the House was appointed in September after an undercover reporter filmed him talking about how MPs could survive on rations after the expenses scandal.
"Basically, it’s being nationalised, you have to live on rations and are treated like s**t."
The elder says, “I spend my money on my garden and claim a small fraction based on what is proper.
I can claim the bloody lot, but I do not.
The MP, a wealthy trader, was first challenged over his expenses in May when he claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the fees office that this was "excessive".
The activist dug a hole in Mr Duncan’s lawn in protest after it was revealed that he claimed £4,000 over three years.
When asked about the increase in mortgage last night, Mr Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements approved both by the fees office and later by Legg."
There is no issue of duck and weaving or anything.
It is absolutely straight down the line, within the rules, authorised and everything.
It just cannot in many ways be clean or simpler.
Welcome all you faithful to see Brighton’s beach hut
Brighton beach huts have found a new life for winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploring through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for each day in December, using Christmas carols as their theme.
The event started on December 1, with visitors allowed to view the latest hut from 5.30pm to 6.30pm each day, with mince pies and mulled wine laid on for free.
The most recent chosen carols are I Saw Three Ships, O Come, Come and The First Noël, where the hut features work by Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a non-stipendiary clergyman in the Chichester diocese and the leader of Beyond.
The Chief rabbi added, “We want to make religion more relevant to people in post-Christendom society.
Why do we expect people to come to a strange old building? It’s my feeling the Church should come to the people and celebrate in exciting ways.
The idea for the beach hut Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends over dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we are trying to represent that through spirituality.
Large climate change gatherings in Copenhagen and around the world
thousands of people gathered on Saturday to support an ambitious and restrictive global warming agreement, which took several hundred arrests.
The gathering of at least 30 thousand people, according to police, and a hundred thousand, according to the organizers, took place in the cold in Copenhagen outside the United Nations climate conference, which is tasked to reach an agreement by Friday that will take effect on 1st of January 2013.
The increasing number of climate rallies around the world, illustrated by these protests, has contributed to the political cost of failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents in Copenhagen occurred shortly after the main procession, when a group of 300 protesters, entirely in black, broke shop windows with paving and hammers, observed a reporter from the AFP.
Riot police provided an immediate and unhesitated response.
According to the police, there are about 600 to 700 hundred arrests, most of which are members of the 'Black Blocks', a small ultra-violent group that appeared at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in East France in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the protest organisers, reported conditions where hundreds of protesters were arrested "without discrimination" and a hundred of them "remained in the street on Saturday night" handcuffed and held in a sitting position despite the extreme cold.
After leaving the Parliament, the procession continued in orderly fashion towards the Bella Center, where negotiations were to take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to enter.
The stage was raise to receive the expected speakers before a candlelight vigil, in which the former South African Archbishop from Cape Town, Desmond Tutu would take part.
The majority of the protesters had arrived by coach and train from major European cities, but many Asian protesters, including some Chinese and Korean, were also present, as well as those from Africa.
Around 3000 people, mainly in sky blue raincoats, formed an initial rally in Copenhagen on the morning, called by Friends of the Earth, who were planning blue waves for "climate justice".
Together we are marching on the street today to demand reparations for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist in the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to tell ourselves that there is no time left, says Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers drying out in Africa; water courses, where you can walk and never before.
The first time in the history of Climate Diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalisation movement has become closer to environmental organisations.
The French Eurodeputy, José Bové, a face of anti-globalisation, explained that he has come to Copenhagen to connect climate justice with social justice :
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands, particularly vulnerable to warming, had kicked off the protests.
According to organizers, some 50 000 people took to the street in Australia.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, took the stage in red, carrying banners about the benefits of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Djakarta, and Canada, demonstrations of several hundred demonstrators were organized to demand more forceful action against climate change.
In France, the "350" network gathered several hundred people, including Paris, Marseilles (in the South), Lille (in the North), and Lyon (in the East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president; Georgia calls it a "farce"
Azerbaijan elected its president on Saturday, a little over a year after Moscow's recognition of the pro-Russian region of Georgia, while Tbilisi calls it a "farce".
The first vote was called to take part in this first vote after the Georgia-Russia war in August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another secessionist Georgian territory recognised by Russia.
The polling stations close at 17:00 GMT.
Attendance was at 58% a few hours before closure, according to Abkhazian Electoral Commission officials.
The first provisional results were to be announced during the night between Saturday and Sunday.
The five candidates in the running, among whom the current president, Sergei Bagapsh, all categorically disapprove the idea of a reunification with Georgia, which has condemned the vote.
This election is a farce.
The Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under total Russian occupation," told his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
Other than Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognised the independence of the area's 216 000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After being separated from Georgia in 1992-1993, after losing its independence from Georgia, Abkhazia is trying to show that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as independent state, declared Svetlana Kvarchia, a 54-year-old historian, who confirms having voted for Mister Bagapsh.
The voter was among the many who took the polling station in a white school building with several palm trees on the front of the building.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential debate in this region given a lush landscape on the Black Sea.
Massive billboards showing Mister Bagapsh beside the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are spread across this small territory of 216 000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the West of the country, the District Chief, Beslan Archba, greeted the Russian officials who came to oversee the vote.
We, the Abkhazian people, are thankful, he said during a small ceremony, referring to the support from Moscow, and particularly to the decision to recognise the independence of Abkhazia.
Soon you will be recognised by the United Nations, while raising his glass of vodka.
The opposition represented in the vote by the former president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, attacks the agreements with Moscow in the previous year, such as the one giving Russia control of the Abkhazian rail network for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he is not supporting the current Government or the opposition.
50% plus one vote is the majority required to win the vote.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second vote must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: demonstrations around the world, incidents in Copenhagen.
Numerous thousands of people across the world marched to demand an ambitious and restrictive climate agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where police were alert and arrested nearly 700 people on the fringes of an aggressive rally.
The crowd, according to police, hundred thousand, according to organizers, gathered in the cold afternoon in Copenhagen, which is expected to receive 193 countries until 18th December, which will be meeting with 193 countries until the 18th of December, which will be meeting with a agreement to be effective on 1st of January 2013.
After leaving the Parliament, the procession headed to the Bella Center, where negotiations were to take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to enter.
The stage was installed to accommodate the speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of former South African Cape Town archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
The procession started a few minutes after the departure of the procession, a group of several hundred demonstrators, entirely black, holding bricks and hammers, reported an AFP reporter.
They immediately surrounded them and intervened no known terms, throwing several of them to the ground.
They reported on the arrest of 600 to 700 hundred people, mainly members of the 'Black Blocks', a small ultra-violent group that appeared at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in the East France in April.
The following afternoon a policeman was injured on the jaw by a piece of paving and four cars were set alight near a squat, which led to the arrest of some 20 people, according to police.
They are kept in close sight of small extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warning.
The majority of the demonstrators were European origin, arriving in coaches and trains from main German cities, London, Amsterdam and Milan.
Large numbers of Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
Around 3000 people, mainly clad in sky blue raincoats, formed an initial rally in Copenhagen on the morning called by Friends of the Earth, who were planning blue waves for "climate justice".
Lily Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee Coalition Group in Copenhagen, explained.
We cannot continue to tell ourselves that there is no time left, says Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers drying out in Africa; water courses, where you can walk and never before.
The first time in the history of Climate Diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalisation movement has become closer to environmental organisations.
The French Eurodeputy, José Bové, a face of anti-globalisation, explained that he has come to Copenhagen to connect climate justice with social justice :
They asked for the help of several well-known personalities, including Danish model Helena Christensen, and the former UN Commissioner for Refugees, Mary Robinson, to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands, particularly vulnerable to warming, had kicked off the protests.
According to organizers, some 50 000 people took to the street in Australia.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, gathered in red against the city hall, carrying banners about the benefits of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, demonstrations of several hundred demonstrators were organized to demand action against climate change.
In France, the "350" network gathered several hundred people, including Paris, Marseilles (in the South), Lille (in the North), and Lyon (in the East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
Historical-Geographical studies are strengthened by the reform of secondary schools, according to Chatel.
Foreign Education Minister, Luc Chatel, told the Weekly Paper on Sunday (JDD) that History and Geography were "reinforced" by the reform, despite being no longer obligatory subjects for the French technical Sixth Form.
The first year students will have four hours per week, and the same programme for common shared culture, says Mr. Chatel.
The minister says, "We need to get out of this hypocrisy" because, he says, "the 'S' course of study is no longer science course, but more generally it is a magnet for the stronger students".
The 'ES' and 'L' courses cannot remain inferior choices behind the 'S' course, he says, adding that "I have not heard many historians or academics expressing indignation at the absence of History-Geography in the technical Sixth Forms either."
The latest IFOP (French Public Opinion Institute) poll revealed that nearly seven out of ten (67%) French people disapprove of the Government project to end compulsory teaching of History-Geography in technical Sixth Forms.
The minister added that there was no question of eliminating the 'S' course philosophy.
Luc Chatel also defended the teacher education reforms, as 16 organisations (students and associations) called for a day of protest to protest against the project, which, in his opinion, threatens the training of future teachers.
For 2nd year Master's (M2), an entry exam focusing on the candidate's discipline will be required at the start of the year, and an acceptance exam testing their capacity to teach will be held at the end of the year, the minister explained.
Additionally, they will cover in-class placements throughout the M2 year, and will then be in front of students for a year as student teachers.
If you add up all the placement work proposed before the exam you already end up with more presence in front of students, which equates to over 300 hours, he continued.
The minister states that he will be taking forward "individual's right to education; something that is not available in national Education".
The plan to abolish the school map is defined as "by 2012".
At the University of Strasbourg (one of France’s top schools), experts have 15 minutes to change opinions on climate change.
fifteen minutes to discuss what is going on at the Copenhagen summit was the challenge posed by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the international group of Climate Evolution experts (GIEC) invited by the EOC in Ulm (Paris).
Ernest Jouzel, Nobel Peace Prize winner, inaugurated the first of the conferences, which was a series of 15 minute lectures from experts, filmed and open to the public, reported an AFP reporter.
They wanted to do something to attract people's attention and make them want to know more, explained one of the day's organizers, 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, outside the conference.
The lecturer interviews are chosen from the most experienced experts in their field and the most charismatic ones are selected.
The topic of global warming is "long, but we can cover the key objectives in a few minutes", Jean Jouzel told the AFP.
This is part of our scientist's role, he stressed, adding that the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely solid scientific case.
The video footage from the conferences will be available on the school website starting 15th December.
The next "Ernest" day is planned for February, followed by others on bimonthly basis.
Late payments: angry from prison guards, action planned
Prison guard unions called for a general rally on Friday to demand payment of their bonuses and overtime before the end of the year holidays.
Prison guards' Association (PFA) has requested that staff, who are not on duty, demonstrate Tuesday morning in front of prison buildings and to "block" them, in order to "expose theft of their earnings".
The CGT-penitential calls for them to "unite in general, rallying at the different prisons to show strong turnout", and calls for the non-payment of "overtime, nightshift bonuses, Sunday and holiday pay" in December for their work in October.
The first prison guard union, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (UFAP/UNSA), calls for general rallying to re-activate discontent and anger.
The penitentary administration Management and the Justice Ministry explain that overtime has increased considerably in 2009 and is not fully covered in the budget, but promise that the balance will be settled in January.
The Chancery stated that Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a communication to the prison guard unions guaranteeing the payment would be made next month.
I do not ignore the efforts made by staff for the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this communication.
Please take immediate action to ensure that this situation, caused by poor evaluation of the number of additional work hours, will not recur in the future, says Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The December pay packet will be very low, except for management staff who benefit from the so-called target and position-related bonuses, says the UFAP/UNSA.
It is absolute scandal, says the inter-regional union from Marseilles, which has announced its decision to boycott all meetings and convocations until further notice.
Staff will not be given Sunday or holiday hours if they are not settled in December, and same goes for overtime, threatens the Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne trade union.
In a time when our goals and responsibilities are expanding but our staff are not, it is more than regrettable to attack the staff's salaries, says the CGT-Penitentiaire de Bordeaux.
The situation is not the same in all regions, with some regions being worse than others.
If anything, the balance is not there, says Jean-François Forget, general secretary of UFAP.
Obama says he gives "nicer stuff" than he receives
The American President, Barack Obama, preparing for his first family Christmas at the White House, tells TV icon Oprah Winfrey that he gives nicer stuff than I get.
In a special programme to be broadcast on the ABC channel on Sunday evening, the president and his wife, Michelle, give an insight into how they plan to celebrate the end of the year festivities in their new home.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged friend, will join in.
Michelle Obama says Bo is a very loyal dog, according to the advertising trailer.
The President took a harsh stance against his claims about the quality of his gifts: "No way; I gave you good gifts last year."
Absolutely, he agreed before laughing and pointing at the First Lady's pearl necklace.
The hourlong lighthearted programme with the famous presenter, who was a fervent Obama supporter during the campaign, the president and his wife also recalled their childhood presents.
Obama remembered a ten-speed bicycle but also a basketball that his Kenyan father had given him for Christmas.
I remember a time when I met my father, who had come to visit us for Christmas, and he gave me a basketball, said the president.
Then I realized that he had given me the ball.
The First Lady, for her part, remembered her dollhouse.
Michelle Obama says I had no idea how to organise a house, so I lined all the furniture against the wall, rather than arranging them around the fireplace.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated on, RTL claims he is in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-opered in Los Angeles due to significant "lesions" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims that the singer has been placed in an artificial coma to prevent pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-opered on Wednesday and Thursday at the Cedars Sinai hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors noticed "lesions resulting from the operation" for the slipped disc undergone in Paris on November 26th, according to his press office in Paris.
The singer's press office wanted to be reassuring, stating that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical bulletin would be communicated within 48 hours.
According to RTL, the first tour partner of the singer, Johnny Hallyday may have been placed in an artificial coma to prevent pain and complications.
The patient will only be in 48 hours after he has at least one eye open, added RTL.
If asked by the AFP, the press office neither confirmed nor commented on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no drain was installed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker was operated on for a slipped disc at the international clinic at Parc Monceau.
The operation, scheduled for several days prior, was carried out by neuro-surgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in artist circles.
The presenter was not available to comment on RTL's information on Thursday evening.
After the operation that he carried out on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was sent to the Cedars Sinai hospital for infection.
The singer, Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his friend was "going through a rough patch", but kept everyone in mind that he was not concerned about the rocker, who is a "fighter".
The airline called me before leaving for Los Angeles and I told him that it was crazy, because taking a 12-hour flight after such a huge operation is not realistic, said Eddy Mitchell.
Johnny Hallyday's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, had wanted to be reassuring, adding that the infection was "contained".
The singer also reported to have spoken with Laeticia, his wife, and not to have noticed any signs of concern.
The singer’s health problems have only spread since he was hospitalized for nine days in July after he fell on his yacht.
Then two months later, to surprise all, Johnny Hallyday was revealed to have had a "minor colonic cancer" operation, then a slight infection.
The singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", which was a tribute to his last goodbye tour.
However since then, every health problem has been reported. Fans and reporters have noticed the singer's difficulty moving around on stage.
In mid November, his entourage even declined further hospitalisation.
Euro-2009/short course: Bousquet's first in his lucky distance
The Frenchman, Frédérick Bousquet, triple medal holder in the long course 2009 World Championship, took the international title for a distance he particularly favours, the 50m freestyle.
The first day of this competition, where full-length swimsuits are permitted for the last time, has seen only three world records beaten, while a wave of them was expected.
One record was improved by the Hungarian, Evelyn Verraszto, 200m medly, and two others by Russia in the 4x50m medly relay.
A regret for Bousquet, who has been taken on the 50m freestyle world record, for which he holds the long course title (20.94).
The two highly competitive swimming events, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman took his mark with a time of 20.53 in a final, where ten swimming teams start - a first at international level.
Bousquet took the Czech, Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian, Sergey Fesikov (20.84).
The world record is always in my hands, and I believed that if the world record was in my reach, I would certainly try it.
According to Bousquet, most swimmers were in polyurethane swimsuits, which will not be permitted starting 1st of January.
The swimsuits have unleashed 238 world records since February 2008, and they will end their epic story in Istanbul, which saw the first ones in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of these swimsuits did not assist the German, Rome's two-time world champion Paul Biedermann on this occasion, where world records were at stake.
The young swimmer failed to reduce his current record in 400m freestyle (3:32.77), but kept the impression by getting second personal best time (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian, Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Dane, Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I do not give it my all in this race.
I knew I could not achieve a world record, but I managed to defend my title and have accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a strong rival in the future, explained Biedermann.
USA: a Zola sarcophagus panel fetches 1.5 million USD
The Roman sarcophagus panel, which was known to be the work of Emile Zola, fetched 1.5 million dollars on Thursday, a significantly higher figure than was expected, announced art auction house Sotheby's.
This front panel, measuring two metres in length and 63cm in height, dating to the 3rd century AD, was valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble "depicting four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and bacchanes" is a rare piece, Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions for Roman and Egyptian antiquities, explained to the AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among around a hundred other lots.
The auction is still going on, but this lot is certainly the one that has attracted most buyers, according to Sotheby's spokesman to the AFP.
The discovery of Emile Zola's acquired this marble piece dates back some time.
The panel remained in the Borghese family collection for over 300 years, then it appeared with the French actress, Cécile Sorel, who made it a feature of her bathroom in her private Paris home, then Paul Reynaud, a minister in the 3rd Republic and briefly the Council's Chairman before Marshal Pétain's accession to power.
The area left a grey area of about fifty years.
The panel was part of an Emile Zola inheritance, opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "The Scarlet Witch" and the series of "Rougon-Macquart" novels.
Zelaya's departure from Honduras to Mexico aborted
Mexican authorities judged on Thursday that conditions are no longer suitable for the transfer of the deposed Honduran president, Manuel Zelaya, who was refused safe passage by the coup-installed Government.
The moment, after a phone conversation with President Zelaya, everything seems to suggest that the possible options for carrying out this transfer are not suitable, according to the Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican Government plane arrived on Wednesday in El Salvador to bring back Mr. Zelaya, according to a source from the General Directorate of Migration.
The Coup Government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "resign" and requested a foreign asylum to allow him safe passage to.
The president refused, because he wanted to travel to Mexico as the incumbent Head of State and an invited guest.
The Coup Government has again met with failure by wanting me to resign, which has taken up five months in Central America.
They could stay here ten years, I have my guitar here, added the deposed president.
The Mexican Embassy sent us with a safe passage request but we cannot accept it because it did not contain an asylum request, the Coup Government Interior Minister, Oscar Raul Matute, announced on Wednesday on HRN radio.
I am not requesting asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya told the Telesur channel, based in Caracas.
Any departure from Honduras would have to be as the president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
The rumours of Mr Zelaya's departure have mobilised the loyalists of the deposed president, who have gathered around the Brazil Embassy, where military forces strengthened their position.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticised the Coup Government position.
This shows the marginal character of this Government in relation to international standards, he added.
Supreme Court, the Army and Congress have rejected the election of Zelaya on June 28th, a day after he organised a public consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the views of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
Once sent to Costa Rica, he returned on September 21st and took refuge at the Brazil Embassy.
If he goes out, he will be arrested to answer to charges of "high treason" according to the Coup Government.
The Coup President, Roberto Micheletti has managed to organise a presidential election on 29th November to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected in the controversial vote, recognised by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina, and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted by landslide against Mr Zelaya's return to power for the remaining term of his term up to January 27th.
Wall Street rises, the US commercial balance feeds optimism
New York Stock Exchange finished higher on Thursday, as American commercial equilibrium figures indicate a return of activity in the United States and with its partners: the Dow gained 0.67%, and the NASDAQ 0.33%.
The final closing figures showed the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 68.79 points to 10 405.83 points, and the NASDAQ, with a technology dominance, rose by 7.13 points to 2 190.06 points.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index had a 0.5% (6.40 points) increase, bringing it to 1 102.35 points.
We have good news from several sides of the Economy, assessed Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial.
However, this is an anecdotic evidence, she added, suggesting the market was focusing on "half full glass".
Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners believes that investors have particularly focused on America's commercial balance figures, which show an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.
The US commercial deficit declined by 7.6% in October compared to September to 32.9 billion dollars.
Analysts were expecting the opposite, a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the increase in trade volumes, especially in the export of goods, reflecting the economical growth of the US commercial partners, according to Christopher Cornell from Economy.com.
In contrast, new unemployment claims in the United States have reached beyond all expectations in the past week, to reach 474 000 claims.
However, in the last four weeks the average number of new employment seekers has fallen to its lowest in a year, according to Scott Marcouiller from Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
Treasury 10-year bond yields have grown to 3.482% against 3.423% the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of Government supporters speak out against the "Ladies in White"
Around 100 pro-government demonstrators spoke out against political prisoners' wives, who had gathered in Havana for International Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration, for which around dozen dissidents were arrested.
Around forty "White Ladies", wives and close to the political prisoners, were slaughtered in the street by supporters of the Castro government as they marched towards the centre of the capital to demand the release of the political prisoners, reported an AFP reporter.
They shouted down with the Yanks!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the Revolutionaries!", and they raise their hands.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes agents, who had come to "ensure their protection".
The previous evening, a similar demonstration was held against the "Ladies in White" in Havana without any injury or arrest.
However, in the Vedado district of Havana, a dozen dissidents, preparing to gather for the International Human Rights Day, were arrested by plainclothes police, reported an AFP journalist.
The police forces forced the dissidents, who were being threatened by pro-government supporters, into unmarked vehicles, according to the journalist.
Dissident arrests in similar circumstances normally last for a few hours.
The 2005 Sakharov Prize recipients, the "Ladies in White" organized a non-authorised march to demand the release of all political prisoners, totaling 200 according to the dissident side.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of which are still behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opposition as "mercenaries or agent" on the books of their sworn enemy, the United States.
Once again, Cuban television covered the demonstration of pro-government supporters against the "antirevolutionaries" on Thursday.
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is frequently accused by European or American NGOs of flouting human rights and freedoms, including the freedom of expression.
The madman kills an eighty-year-old with a knife and wounds 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
The man with two knives has killed a man in his eighties and wounded five others in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) during rush hour, last Thursday.
The initial findings of the investigation are based on evidence from witnesses and police, and the attacker, aged 28, appears to have struck an eighty-year-old with two knives for reasons unclear.
The elderly man, born in 1929, according to the police union, Alliance, died from his wounds in the hospital.
In or near the same pharmacy, he started attacking a couple, including a pregnant woman.
The husband, around thirty, came between them and was wounded.
The first two victims, severe wounds, were admitted to the hospital, where the eighty-year-old man died.
The days of the other injured person may be numbered, as vital organs have been affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman was then taken ill and was hospitalized in shock, according to one police source.
The armed man, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, fled into the street on Jean Jaurès Boulevard.
The reported murderer has wounded two passers-by, apparently randomly, one thirteen-year-old and one forty-year-old, the latter severely.
By evening, the scenario remained unclear.
The officer was armed with two butcher's knives that he carried crossed on his back, explained Arnaud Pressé at the scene, an officer from the Alliance of Hauts-de-Seine Union.
The suspect was able to overcome by a group of passers-by, including youngsters, according to witness reports collected by the AFP.
I saw a guy of about thirty with green jacket.
Three young people tried to intervene.
They could not manage it, because the guy was well-built, according to Alberto, a server in a nearby bar.
The crowd fell on him, including a town policeman, who broke his wrist, he added.
Then on Jean-Jarès Boulevard, outside number 61, two town policemen, one of whom was the chief, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured by punches, police sources said.
The events took place on one of Clichy-la-Garenne's main street, where many local businesses are operating.
Some passers-by came to tell me that there was someone in the street.
When I went out, I saw a 70-year-old on the ground, put the person in recovery position, then I noticed a severe wound on the abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, aged around 30, with knife wounds.
National police officers were the ones who arrested the man, who was not carrying any identification documents.
The case will be brought to the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office by the region's police service for Haut-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The madman was taken to a hospital on Thursday evening.
The man has not yet had the chance to speak after being taken into custody.
A police source did not exclude the possibility of him being committed to a psychiatric hospital.
The police source says six police men needed to subdue the man at the police station in Clichy, where he was taken.
The fever was "hyperexcitement" as are all these types of maniacs, whose strength increases tenfold under its effect".
USA: Polanski's lawyer calls for afresh drop of cases
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish film director, Roman Polanski, called again in Los Angeles on Thursday (California, western United States) to abandon the investigation against his client, who is currently house arrested in Switzerland for a vice case over 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of "The Pianist" cited serious errors in the procedures at the Second District of the California Court of Appeal.
They are calling for the dropping of charges here and now, added Mr. Hummel, adding that the behaviour of the judge, who was handling the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, sends chills down the spine.
According to him, Rittenband was believed to have spoken with one of the prosecutors, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison before passing sentence, which is a serious error in procedure.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" from the words of the suspect, David Wells.
However, Mr. Wells eventually declared that he had "lied" to the author of the documentary at the end of September.
In the event of the court's refusal to abandon proceedings, Mr. Hummel called for a trial to be held, which would allow him to present evidence to back his arguments.
The Prosecution has re-iterated its earlier argument that no abandonment of the charges could be considered while Roman Polanski did not appear in court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker had fled the United States before his sentence was given for "unlawful sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
The man has not been seen in the United States since.
The deputy prosecutor for Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, therefore declared that Roman Polanski must be present at the hearing.
This case is trying to send a message not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants that it is ok to flee.
The filmmaker is asking for a favour from the court, while at the same time showing disregard for its authority.
The three judges now have 90 days to return their verdict.
Hummel was not the only one to request that the prosecution against Roman Polanski be abandoned.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also called for an end to the proceedings.
Warning that her client can no longer be harassed with every resurfacing of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can claim that this was a right procedure.
Thirty two years is enough.
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26th September in Switzerland on an American warrant.
After more than two months in the prison, he was placed in house arrest at his chalet in Gstaad, pending his possible extradition.
Wall Street closes without momentum, slowed by a strengthening dollar
New York Stock Exchange closed with no particular heading on Friday, in a market torn between better than expected indicators in the United States and a strengthening dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% but the NASDAQ dropped 0.03%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 65.67 points to 10 471.50 points, while the NASDAQ, with a technology predominance, has declined by 0.55 point to 2 190.31 points.
The wider Standard & Poor's 500 has advanced by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1 106.41 points.
Very calm, says Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It is still within a narrow margin; trading volumes have become very low, and I think that this will continue until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better than expected economic indicators, which have "contributed to improving market opinion on the strength of the economic recovery", summarised Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the United States, retail sales have climbed by 1.3% in November, for the second month in a row, and far more than was expected.
Moreover, American consumer confidence has clearly bounced back in December, to 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month.
The indexes have been slowed by a re-raise of the dollar to a new two-month high against the Euro, which “puts downward pressure on the sectors that are most sensitive to the economic situation”, explained Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank.
Technology securities have thus lost some ground.
The bond market has fallen.
Treasury 10-year bond yields have grown to 3.540% against 3.482% the previous evening.
World pageant once again in South Africa
After a month-long trek across South Africa, the 112 candidates for the World’s Most Beautiful Woman are preparing to enter the final straight on Saturday to achieve their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
The five ladies have already landed their tickets to the semi-final.
Congratulations to Miss Japan, Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldino from Gibraltar, and Yanbing Ma from Canada.
It was a real whirlwind.
The opportunity to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Cape Town is incredible.
Sierra Leone - I saw so many things and I have so much new experience, said Miss of Sierra Leone.
This competition, which is taking place in South Africa for the ninth time, will be transmitted live on Saturday from Midrand, north Johannesburg, starting at 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I could not have dreamed of a better country to award my crown.
The experience was fascinating.
Congratulations to have been able to live it twice, says Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
The young Russian candidate has been remembered for many talks with candidates and the rediscovery of landscapes in this country that take your breath away.
After a month of galas, rehearsal, and safaris, the candidates are focusing on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra is planning to follow the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present at this vote, as well as Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both who have become Bollywood stars.
It is the dream of every woman to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not all about appearance.
Ambassadors for our countries are ambassadors for our countries and I want to return home with the crown, says Miss India with a broad smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
Candidates will parade in traditional outfits and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by Angela Chow, an ethnic Chinese television presenter, the South African ex-beauty queen Michelle McLean, and an official from the World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa showed that it could welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is difficult to improve, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates went on safari, as they did last year, visiting the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bicycle, and sampled the local food.
Exceptionally, they also meet the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who stood up and handed them hands.
Unusual for a Head of State, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
The most beautiful memory will be the World Cup draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for football in June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I have mixed with people I never thought I would be able to approach.
I will without doubt be returning for the 2010 World Cup, says Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is very positive, according to his son David.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is very positive, says his son David, who is in hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
The youngest son, David Hallyday, took the plane from Paris at 13:00 local time (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son had a calm air and promise to be heading "without delay" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles.
The singer was "put in an artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for comfort reasons, to prevent his suffering, and to allow his treatment to be administered", according to the press service.
Johnny Hallyday was already in an artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for infection from a slipped disc operation on 26th November in Paris.
The singer was operated on in the night from Wednesday to Thursday because of significant lesions resulting from the operation.
The wife, Laeticia, went on Friday morning to the Los Angeles French High School, where their daughter Jade is enrolled, to attend a school performance, observed an AFP photographer.
The Head of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery of the Pitié-Salpétrier hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to see the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer took the singer to the serious question of Dr Stphane Delajoux, the neuro-surgeon who operated on the singer on 26th November at the International Clinic of Parc Monceau in Paris.
Then they told us it was a huge disaster.
The Los Angeles surgeons were aghast, declared Mr. Camus.
I heard talk of possible legal proceedings, he said.
Jean Claude Camus believed that Johnny Hallyday had "left too soon for Los Angeles with the Paris surgeon's permission".
The doctor told me that there was no problem for this trip, which shocked me as I have two slipped discs, he added.
The singer was reported to have left without drain or anything, after his Paris operation.
Dr Stphane Delajoux is well-known in art circles.
The actress Marie Trintignant was operated on in Vilnius a few days before her death at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at the time.
In 2007, he operated on the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb haemorrhagic haemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a very famous reputation, convicted by the Law on several occasions in medical liability, as well for fraud and tax evasion.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer for the Doctors' governing body, accused him of being "a man without scruples", who regularly answers to the governing body's Council and who is "far from reputable".
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux made an announcement on Friday through his solicitor, David Koubbi.
The latter reported that the operation was "perfectly done" and that post-operation tests returned normal.
The operation was not haemorrhagic and therefore did not require a drain to be installed.
However, the singer's tour, for whom health problems have been multiplying since summer, appears to be on hold.
The tour is very soon, according to Mr. Camus.
The UDF alliance speaks out and orders the New Centre party to stop using its acronym.
The UDF alliance, controlled by François Bayrou's Democratic Movement (MoDem), reacted on Friday to the bid to buy out the acronym of the former Giscardian party, by ordering him not to use it under any circumstances, threatening legal action if he does not.
Hervé Morin announced publicly that he would recoup the UDF acronym, holding that François Bayrou was not worthy of its political heritage, having extended his hand to the left.
The Defence Minister, whose party is partner to the UMP, had reportedly planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC's national Council.
In support of his move, he received support from deputy Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP switched to NC), who claims his ownership of the UDF trademark by being the first to record it at the National Industrial Property Institute.
However, Friday evening, the UDF Alliance office, headed by François Bayrou's friends, has come out of silence to attack the deputy, ordering him not to use the acronym and to transfer the trademark to them, otherwise threatening legal action.
In recent days you have added declarations that you are proposing political action to regain the UDF acronym, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from the MoDem, as well as the senator Jean Arthuis from the Centre Alliance.
You thought it acceptable to include in your campaign literature and on your website the movement's name, the New Centre, followed by the slogan: Today's UDF, remarks those who signed the document.
As you are well aware, you have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office, requiring that the NC remove "immediately any mention of the UDF name from all material, and from (their) internet site".
The request also requests that Hervé de Charette "transfer ownership of the trademark to its rightful owners".
If you fail to do this, the matter would be referred to the courts to ensure that the Law and the legitimate rights of UDF members were maintained, warning the document's signatories.
In their communication, they emphasize that the UDF has been a political movement since 1978 and that they have "made their choice" to leave him in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002 to establish the UMP".
The New Centre, according to them, has no right to use the UDF acronym (Union for French Democracy).
The last assembly voted in 2007 for its union with the MoDem for three years, and for the creation of a Office charged with defending the material and moral interests of the body founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
The Office continues, when he registered the trademark, he had not been a UDF member for three years, but in fact he was with the UMP.
The suspect is profiting in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the lack of a registered trademark for the UDF acronym by taking it to benefit his own account.
The incident is turning into a major offence, they state, before adding ironically about the NC's strategy that: "in politics as well as in real life, it is more dignified to make one's own name than try to become somebody by fraudulently acquiring a name we have no right to".
Liliane Bettancourt Case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for "abuse of strength"
The Nanterre tribunal on Friday appointed François-Marie Banier to trial to determine whether he used her weakened mental state to defraud her of some of her wealth.
The photographer, 62, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for "abuse of strength" a crime that carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a 375 000 euro fine.
The decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in this case, which is turning into a worthy family saga involving one of the richest families in France, where mother and daughter are torn apart while holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
However, the 15th Magistrate's Court has also orderd a combined expert medical opinion of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87, to be led by three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L’Oréal has always refused to undergo such an exam, at least not with the conditions proposed by the Nanterre court at the time of the investigation.
The doctors nominated on Friday have to submit a report by 10th March 2010, including whether Liliane Bettencourt could have found herself in a weakened state and at which times.
I think she will submit to it.
They will talk with her about it, according to Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman.
The lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, congratulated himself on the court's decision.
It is good news (...) Expert opinion will prove that he (Mr Banier) manipulated this elderly lady, whom we should protect, he added.
The daughter and only child has been involved in taking to court the case against François-Marie Banier, the photographer and all-round artist, whom she accuses of using her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros in donations, in form of cheques, life insurance contracts, or art.
The photographer has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, who she considers a long-standing friend.
The court on Friday was due to examine the admissibility of the case brought by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, and the lawyers’ arguments often turned into unfamiliar family matters.
The lawyer cited three letters from his client (in 1999, 2003, and 2005) to her solicitor, in which she expressed suspicions about Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer, "could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Mr. Banier once or two times a day for fifteen years?"
Françoise has been unable to speak to me since her marriage.
In its part, the Court in Nanterre has again ruled that the plaintiff's claim was not admissible for action, especially after a judge supervising guardianship refused her request to initiate a procedure allowing legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt is fully capable of participating in legal proceedings, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
Nobody needs to act on her behalf.
The Court determined that it would make a decision once the case concerning the admissibility of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers' claim had taken place.
Management revolution or end of competitive intelligence?
If nothing changes in how France's biggest enterprises are run, our fight for competitive intelligence will have been in vain...
The Management's attitude towards employees reflects the position of enterprises and their consumers before the marketing revolution: employees should be taught to adhere to "values" dictated from above, as it was in the past, when products created by the factory engineers were drop on the consumer.
The marketing revolution moved the strategies for conquering markets again, even if authoritarian temptation to impose products that are unrelated to the consumer’s preferences often resurfaces!
Demobilisation of employees can lead to terminal demoralisation.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the visible part of a far more widespread problem affecting management employees.
Demobilisation significantly impacts the development of an organisation's strategic functions, especially in R&D and even more so in competitive intelligence.
In fact, CI "requires from all concerned (...) a proactive approach and long-term vision"; it requires from employees a commitment that is entirely contradicted by authoritarian management methods.
The reason for this is that we are calling for a management revolution, which would consist in placing employees at the centre of an enterprise's concerns alongside consumers.
The very relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Does internal opinion surveys - such as those given by Orange to its employees - stimulate this revolution in managerial methods?
However, I fear it will not.
- Firstly, because I have witnessed that, when faced with a new situation, any organisation will arrive, after many detours, at doing chiefly... what it always does!
Next, because authoritarianism - a disease of power - grows proportionally with the magnitude of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour.
The most technical educational institutions have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
The latter adopt, for intellectual convenience, the old behaviourist theory, which recently was re-awakened by the "neuro-sciences" of the United States, which have been widely and silently disseminated by business institutes and the Media.
In this way, by suggesting that "levers" can be pulled for management staff's commitment, a recent Ipsos survey published on Figaro.fr promotes leaders into a mechanistic governance position, unsuited to the modern world.
Identify and measure mobilisation factors
In contrast, the management revolution needed for the correct functioning of modern enterprises requires the adoption of a humanistic vision of human behaviour.
It is a combination of a fundamental admission: for employees, commitment to the enterprise is only possible if it is clearly perceived as a way to realize a part of their dreams, ambitions and plans.
Currently, only studies produced through motivation factor analysis adopt the concept of employee motivation.
This study has proved that they form a perceived view of their organisation based on a pre-defined consensus of opinion, which allows them to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life plans.
By identifying and gauging these mobilisation factors, enterprise leaders can control, predict and anticipate their social performance and turn their resource management "the right way round".
The latter create a favourable terrain for the concerted development of robust and effective competitive intelligence.
Oslo speech: the "just war" earns Obama praise from the Right
The American Right congratulated Obama for the speech given in Oslo on the previous evening in Oslo, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 would have defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives, who had mock the award to Obama on October 9th, were this time giving the President speech their applause, led by Sarah Palin, former Vice President of 2008 elections.
Michelle Palin, right-wing champion of the Republican party, told the daily newspaper USA Today.
The War is, of course, one of the last things Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We must stop these terrorists over there, she stressed.
Senator Obama, who has inherited the two wars from his predecessor, George W. Bush, in Iraq and Afghanistan, applied himself to justify force, a way to explain his decision to send 30 000 additional troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
The other opposition to Mr Obama, Newt Gingrich, believed that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
Very good, approved the former Speaker in the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "Evil is present in the world" in the presidential discourse.
From certain perspectives, I found this speech to be of historic significance, according to Mr. Gingrich, in an interview for the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former representative, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican inauguration of the 2012 presidential elections, was thrilled to see a "President from the left" remind the Noble Committee members that they would not be free and in the position to award a peace prize if force was not an option.
Michael Gerson, a former writer for George W. Bush and re-converted columnist for the Washington Post, has given “a very American speech”.
The President presented himself as a "world citizen" as he always does, warning Europeans to live in a security bubble that they did not create and are doing little to preserve, according to Mr. Gerson.
The few unconvinced right-wingers, a hawkish character from the Bush era, John Bolton, described the speech as "drab, turgid, and uninspired" on National Review Online.
To the right, the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Obama resorting to force.
When we wrap war inside the notion of justice, the mass killing of innocent people can easily be justified, he warned.
Centre-left Press remained proud of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, still believed that the Nobel Prize was prematurely awarded to Mr Obama, described his address as "a blockbuster" even for a speaker with a talent.
Oslo speech should be a roadmap for international decisions on conflict, poverty and oppression, according to the Californian newspaper.
The New York Times reports that Mr Obama made the speech that was needed, which is both sombre and edifying.
Road freight: three marathons for one agreement to save Christmas delivery
Following three marathon sessions of negotiations, transport unions and the TLF, the only employer's organisation to have remained to end the strike order and the threat on Christmas delivery.
During the signing on Friday evening, Transport Secretary Dominique Bussereau was "delighted" with the agreement after several rounds of negotiations on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of negotiations, negotiating sides left in small hours with the hope of a quick signing of the text later in the morning.
The door was opened after three employers' organisations (FNTR, UNOSTRA, OTRE) slammed the door.
However, it took a further six hours from a meeting that started at 11am to everyone agree, and the text to be signed at 6pm.
The disagreement "would have been very damaging for the companies" and "it looked like it might threaten the end of year festivities", Mr Bussereau added.
The document allows for a 4% increase in salaries for the lowest ones (local and regional road transport), and a 2.2% increase for the higher ones (international transport).
Hours, for those on lower pay, range from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It is not much, but we have come a long way, explains Patrice Clos (Workers Union).
This evening we will give the order to our campaigners not to form blockades or picket at delivery depots.
There may be some difficult people, who remain uncooperative, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, congratulated the agreement, even if it was difficult to concede the increases on the higher salaries due to international competition.
The increases will be of the order of 170 euros per month for the lower salaries and from 100 to 120 euros for the higher ones.
It is a common sense agreement, respecting the workers, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) praised it as a "historic agreement".
As for Richard Jaubert (CGT), he called it an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also allows for a 3% increase in travel costs and maintaining current general road transport conditions for the first half of 2010, which will allow for discussion of a 13th month's pay and the modernisation of the collective labour agreement.
According to Mr Bussereau, "a 100 million euro cut in employers' charges" was the subject of an amendment in corrective financial legislation for 2009, voted in the night from Thursday to Friday at the National Assembly.
The Government will ask that the Senate vote on it "in the same timeframe".
The signature from the TLF allows the agreement to be applied in first instance to all the companies that are members of the organisation, and secondly to the whole profession subject to its extension by the Minister for Labour.
It will be done "in very short time", says Mr Bussereau.
The opposing employers' organisations can only delay the process.
The FNTR called it a "sham" because the 100 million euros were already promised to the sector in compensation for part of the carbon tax.
The Transport Secretary urgently forced us to the table, not with a two-sided review, but to prevent upsetting the turkey-eaters this Christmas, says the UNOSTRA.
The OTRE believes the agreement will "dig the graves of large number of the sector's SMEs over the next 12 months".
RER A: disruption this weekend, unions unhappy with RATP proposals
Delays on the RER A, the largest urban public transport link in France, are expected to continue over the weekend, as meetings on Friday, the second day of strike, between the unions and RATP management have left their pay demands unmet.
Saturday and Sunday, on this critical weekend of shopping before Christmas, trains will only run between 10am and 8pm, with only one train running on the central stretch (between La Défense and Nation) and one out of four running outside the central section.
The operation of the interchange with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, causing passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, who welcome 200 000 customers every day, were very happy to see the RATP making efforts to assist the department stores.
The RER A runs through the Parisian conurbation from West to East.
RATP segment runs from Saint Germain en Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, approximately one out of two trains ran at peak times, with almost no trains running during off-peak periods, as planned.
As on Thursday, there was no problem with crowds on the platforms, as Parisians had themselves organised.
The station at Saint Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less busy than normally, mainly because of the absence of school and college students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val de Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had gotten up an hour and half earlier to make sure of being on time.
Saint Lazare station saw no overcrowding, the SNCF stated, having planned for additional support staff and police officers.
The RER A trains operated by the SNCF to or from Cergy-Le Haut were departing or arriving from Saint-Lazare station, where they link with the metro.
New general meetings for strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will review the results of a meeting with Management on Friday afternoon.
The Director proposes to negotiate a specific agreement for the RER A on all aspects, working hours, career paths, etc.
It is not what the drivers, who are demanding the bonus they have, want, according to Thierry Garon (SUD).
RATP has even given its offer of bonuses on hold, CGT claimed, adding that the management "could not be involved in resolving the problem, while road transport and the SNCF have done and dusted it".
New meeting is scheduled for Monday for a wider review of practice conditions for the profession, the RATP reported.
They prompt the unions to remark that the company "did not care about its weekend passengers".
During the morning, some 150 drivers invaded a work council meeting at the company's seat in Paris.
The meeting was when Management, which had previously refused to enter into any discussions during the strike, suggested the meeting as a motion to calm the situation.
The dispute is threatening to extend to RER B on Tuesday, after an advance notice by the UNSA and the Independents groups.
The unions are demanding a bonus of 120 euros (UNSA) to 150 euros, with a 30-euro variable band (CGT, FO, CFDT, SUD, Independents) and are complaining about the deterioration in work conditions on this line serving a million passengers every day.
The RER drivers, all in the later stage of their career, are paid a gross salary of 2200 to 2700 euros, with 600 to 650 euros of bonus for split shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkey justice bans the pro-Kurd party, a decision that is loaded with consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court returned a verdict on Friday for the dissolution of the main pro-Kurd party, a decision that prompted angry protests in the Kurdish community in the Southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
The decision is likely to complicate the work of the Government, as it has recently made positive gestures towards the Kurdish community in an effort to resolve a 25 year old conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it was "a hotbed of damaging activities against the State's independence and unfailing unity", the Court President Hasim Kiliç declared to the press at the end of four days of deliberations.
The decision was unanime by the 11 judges, with a majority of seven sufficient to force the disbanding, Mr. Kiliç added, adding that 37 of the party's representatives, including its president, Ahmet Türk, and the deputy, Aysel Tugluk, have been disbanded for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity, from which both Mr. Türk and Mrs. Tugluk benefited, and the confiscation of party assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
The leaders had earlier warned that the representatives would leave Parliament and take their seats as representatives with no affiliation.
The decision was taken after investigations initiated in 2007 by the Appeal Court judge Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying "directives" from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered to be a terrorist organisation by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe the DTP is a legal political shop window for the PKK rebels.
The party maintains that it has no organic links with the PKK, but refuses to recognise it as a terrorist organisation and is calling for the Government to open negotiations with it.
The court's verdict comes at a time when the Government has extended its hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures, reinforcing its rights in an attempt to curtail Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
They have stated that a dissolution of the party could lead to renewed tensions in the Anatolian Southeast, where a large number of protests against the terms for the detention of the PKK head, Abdullah Öcalan, have turned into clashes with police in the past few weeks.
The Law was announced as soon as it was announced, thousands of protesters gathered before the DTP building in Diyarbakir, the main city of the Southeast, mainly Kurdish.
They fired tear gas grenades and water cannons, as demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails and stones with slings.
Around 100 people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk declared that the Law's decision would "deepen the sorrow".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue by banning a party, he told the Press.
The Government, a party rooted in Islamic influences, also condemned the decision.
We are on principle against the closing of parties.
It does not solve anything, declared the Energy Minister, Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a blowtorch to the Government's democratic olive branch, says political analyst Ahmet Insel.
However, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
The PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers in North Turkey three days earlier, one of the bloodiest in the last months.
snow can come.
The Wolfgang Brauburger wishes for a really hard, frosty winter.
Because he wants to make people laughing stock, says the head of the FES winter road maintenance service.
Because his employees can try and learn every face of their vehicle's technology.
This may be the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
Here, the FES is operating according to a precise plan.
As soon as Frankfurt is blanketed in snow and temperatures drop below zero, 20 so-called "A Routes" are serviced by large-scale distribution vehicles.
These include main traffic roads and through roads such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstrasse.
It also includes fire roads, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and roads with slopes, such as Atzelbergstrasse.
The service of the FES starts at three in the morning.
The approximately 1,040 km would, if necessary, be gritted with wet salt, which has better adhesive properties, within no more than three hours.
The FES starts at three in the morning, so the route is free by the time commuter traffic starts.
It becomes difficult when it only starts snowing at 7.30 am.
Then we are faced with a problem, says the head of the winter road service, "because nobody is prepared to make way for the gritting vehicles".
Only then, if it continues to snow, is the turn of approach and connecting roads, which also include Rat-Beil-Strasse.
The last priority is quiet side and minor road.
It is where complaints are made, knows Brauburger.
At five in the morning, the footmen of the FES set to work, and dangerous areas and passages are cleared.
The FES can usually not attend all bike routes.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which keeps watch on the bridges, particularly from 10 pm to 4.30 am, says Brauburger.
As slippery ice quickly forms on them, the gritter starts as soon as temperatures drop below two degrees centigrade.
Where required, it is also called out by the police.
The Dinosaur s shelter
Tawa Hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animal, standing two metres tall and lengthening 1.50 metres on two strong hind legs, had long, curved skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple million years later, it would not be anything special.
Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with such physical features, reports Sterling Nesbitt and his team at the University of Texas in Austin.
The animal lived about 215 million years in what is now New Mexico, which was back then in dry zone of the supercontinent Pangaea at the equator.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It reveals much about the relationship, spread, and features of early dinosaurs.
In 2006 Nesbitt and other palaeontologists started excavation on the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Once a day we found dozens of dinosaur bones, which is exemplary for sediments from the Triassic period.
The scientists identified some bones quickly.
During the excavations they collected the remains of total five animals.
Early dinosaur history evidence confirms theory
Tawa is a sun god of the Hopi Indians.
Sterling Nesbitt says it is an exceptional find: "Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic period are extremely rare. Mostly, only individual fragments are found.
Other dinosaur researchers do not share this enthusiasm.
This is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theory on the early history of dinosaurs.
According to current doctrine, the dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which means the classification of these primal dinosaurs is highly contentious.
The experts discussed, for example, the classification of the saurians into three main lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included Tyrannosaurus rex, Velociraptor and birds, the four-legged sauropods known as the long necks and their relatives, and the plant-eating Ornithischiae (bird-hipped saurians), which later included Triceratops and Stegosaurus species.
According to Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa Hallae is a primal theropod.
It has an interesting mix of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
The skull of Tawa Hallae, for example, scientists found air bags, as the descendants of the reptiles, birds, have.
The air bags ensure that bird breathing is more efficient than that of mammals.
Tawa Hallae's spinal bones were also partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of the large sauropods later also had air bags and lightweight bones, the joint ancestor of these two groups may have come up with this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America are expected.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, scientists believe that the saurians appeared there first.
The three development lines started early and spread from South America across all parts of the planet, forming a single land mass as Pangaea.
This theory is backed by the fact that the team found two more theropods which are not particularly closely related to Tawa Hallae.
The three cannot possibly descend from a common ancestor, so they must have migrated to the same place, according to the scientists.
The evidence is that there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the Science study.
But there are always contradictions.
The older species, Silesaurus, belonging to the sister group of the dinosaurs, lived in Poland, says the Bonn-based paleontologist Martin Sander.
The distorted picture may emerge simply because a high number of primitive dinosaur fossils have survived over the years, while little is found on other continents.
How dinosaurs developed from a relatively rare sidearm of the reptile tree to become the dominant tetrapod vertebrate of the Mesozoic is still anyone's guess.
During Triassic period, the dinosaurs still shared their habitat with a large number of other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodile and pterosaurs and with many other species.
The dinosaurs spread across the world and developed many new species, while their relatives died on the threshold from the Triassic to the Jurassic periods.
Success story never lasts.
There are two ways to explain this switch, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a case of mass dying, which the dinosaurs randomly survived but not the other reptiles.
The dinosaurs were better adjusted, meaning that they could beat the competition.
Any event, the success story does not last for ever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped a group of animals, which had also developed back in the Triassic period and since living in the shadows, to blossom: mammals.
Vienna to Sao Paulo Solidarity
The list is long and international.
Toronto University professors are on it, as are those from Cambridge, Vienna and Berkeley in California.
Lecturers from Naples are included, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The vacation by the police of the Frankfurt Goethe University Casino has worldwide consequences.
278 professors and teaching assistants of the Goethe University, but also of colleges from Germany, Europe and North America are showing their solidarity with the protesting students on Westend campus.
In a statement written in both German and English, they "condemn" the police action initiated by the Executive Committee.
Werner Müller-Estler, University president, seized the building last week, because walls and art objects were besmirched.
Five students were injured in the action.
The material damage, the signatories argue, is not sufficient to justify "forceful dissolution of self-organised courses of students and lecturers by a police commando unit".
The vacation represents an unacceptable infringement on the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism is designed to "destigmatise and criminalise the protest" and distracts from the issue.
The Executive Committee has refused to enter into the necessary discourse.
The teaching staff demand the immediate termination of the criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupants did not support the damage to property, read the statement.
Protest legitimised
The young youth ranks of Verdi Union and the German Association of Unions are also showing solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for their own future, says Verdi State Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen Science Minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) supported the approach of the university president and police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are absolutely inacceptable means, the MEP said in a topical session on Thursday in the Wiesbaden parliament.
We have sympathy for the protest, but cannot accept vandalism, said the CDU parliament member Peter Beuth.
The different position was taken by the opposition parties - the SPD, Greens and Left Party.
The CDU is taking besmirched walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left Party).
Instead of taking the students' arguments and students seriously, they organized this vacation.
The Left Party has filed an application asking the Minister of Internal Affairs to report on the police action.
New Silicon Valley
The city was a secret city, unaccessible to Westerners.
Zelenograd, one of ten districts in the city of Moscow, was a highly guarded location for secret arms research in the Soviet Union.
The municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from Moscow centre is considered Russia's Silicon Valley.
Important research and production facilities for micro and nano technology are located here.
In September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd made contacts with the Frankfurt science centre in Riedberg - with the university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
The visits were several, and on Wednesday Zelenograd and Riedberg finally signed a "protocol for closer cooperation in Frankfurt on Wednesday.
The Moscow Deputy Mayor, Yuri Roslyak, and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Zelenograd led the Russian delegation and Economic Affairs Head Edwin Schwarz signed on behalf of Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized companies focusing on natural science research will travel to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Science exchange
The idea is to establish continuous scientific exchange.
Business relations are also being eyed.
FIZ companies will have the option to get a foothold in the growing Russian market.
In turn, Russian businesses want to win orders in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of the most important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electrophysics, and major companies such as Sitronics and Rossiyskaya Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (verbatim "green city") was named from the wooded hills where the research facilities are located.
Stuttgart brake block
The impact and dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be overestimated.
For its supporters, the project is no less than a "new heart of Europe".
Very rightly so. S21 is far more than lowering a train station, more than a huge construction project, which will plunge the city of Baden-Württemberg into a terrible chaos of building sites for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 are born out of the 1980s.
Terminus stations with rails ending in the middle of towns are considered to be fossils of the 19th century in terms of traffic technology, which act as brake blocks to modern rail traffic, as it used to take a huge time to shift engines from back to front.
Pull in, stop briefly, pull out - that's the plan.
Then, terminus stations were supposed to disappear: as in Frankfurt and Munich.
In Stuttgart: a non-terminus station, which is about halfway along the trans-European rail line between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - which is the heart of Europe.
S21 is actually being built now, although the 1980s vision has no longer been compatible with the reality for years.
Even very ambitious planners have recognised that it is virtually unpayable to lower the stations in Hesse and Bavaria.
Terminus stations no longer have pulling in and out problems since the development of push-pull trains with rail traction units and control cabs at both ends.
Still: Stuttgart 21 along with the new ICE route to Ulm is now being started.
State and municipal politicians have enforced it.
German Rail is participating, also because the risks of the Republic's biggest single infrastructure project will be borne by the taxpayer and not the state company.
As regards urban development, development can be more or less justified.
The city is being created which, if the computer-generated graphics are to be believed, will feature a lot of green.
For rail traffic system, S21 is damaged.
The non-terminus railway station and the line extension are designed for passenger transport, which - typically for the 1980s - is expected to see huge growth.
At the time, no competition was found from no-frills airlines.
Contemporary traffic policy should prioritise the handling of cargo transport, as rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than by a tractor on the road.
The line to be constructed is not suitable for freight trains due to steep slopes.
More seriously, S21 also affects many other rail projects.
The amount of six billion euros is to be buried in the Swabian land.
That is the official figure.
Experts expect ten to fifteen billion to be more realistic.
One thing is certain, the money will be missing at other nodes and bottlenecks in the network over the next decade.
The total of sixty major projects are on the list of the transport ministry.
The most important ones are to expand the some 180 km of the line through the Rhine Valley.
Work has been continuing in slow motion since 1987.
It is urgent to really put foot down here.
S21 will act as brake block.
The Rhine Valley line will become a bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government review airport safety decision
The state government was not able to decide in parliament whether it would appeal against the decision of Hesse's Administrative Court (VGH) to ban night flights.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to review the 400+-page VGH verdict, said economics minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel recently confirmed that the state would have to reorganise night flights in the event of building the planned north runway at Frankfurt Airport.
The verdict states that the granting of 17 flights between 11 pm and 5 am, as planned by the state government, is not compatible with the protection of the population from flight noise as specified by law.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it will appeal the verdict.
The opposition called for this delay and called for the government representatives to do without an appeal before the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
CDU and FDP leadership Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel asked the CDU and FDP to return to their promise to ban night flights, which they made before the election.
It is bloody difficult when you are allowed to keep one's word, referring to the FDP election slogan "We keep our word".
Posch denied the accusation from Schäfer-Gümbel that the state government was trying to achieve their night flights by "skewing justice and playing tricks".
A detailed legal examination would take time.
The coalition is not going to act on "a brief first impression".
We need a legally compliant decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As presented by the opposition, his party has not made any statements regarding the night flight ban.
US banks repay state support
The crisis-hit US major banks are breaking free from their state boundaries.
On Wednesday Bank of America repaid the support from the bank protection fund TARP in a single go.
The report says that Citigroup is also planning to repay the state support.
The institutions therefore want to get a free ride from the restrictions associated with the acceptance of the money, such as the limits on manager bonuses and high charges.
Bank of America had raised some USD 19 billion from investors through convertible loans.
The rest of the money was taken from its own kitty, which was well filled through the sale of business units.
The cash injection helped over a difficult time.
The bank overstretched at the height of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also plans to raise cash on the capital market to free itself from its state liabilities.
The US bank has already announced a capital increase of some USD 20 billion, according to CNBC based on circles.
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment.
Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley have already paid their support in June.
Quick choice
It all happened much faster than expected.
Following the board of directors having pushed out the acting editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender, the broadcaster is now able to present his successor.
Today, the committee wanted to vote on the appointment.
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of ZDF's main studio in Berlin.
ZDF did not confirm this - officially, not to anticipate the process.
However, the plan to not further damage ZDF Director Markus Schächter, if this suggestion also fails with the board of directors, will also play a role.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs support from nine of 14 committees.
The result of the vote was not known when going to press.
The last two weeks Schächter was unsuccessful at the board of directors with his suggestion to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender by five years.
While only seven members voted for Brender, seven voted against him.
Because the majority of the Union in the administration board had already signaled that they would not confirm Brender in office.
Roland Koch, Hesse’s Prime Minister, organised the opposition to the editor-in-chief.
With the argument that ZDF's news broadcasts had lost viewers under Brender, he rejected a further term in office of the highly regarded editor-in-chief.
Then, shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the exercise of political influence on ZDF was being castigated.
The most recently, 35 civil rights campaigners have joined the debate and rated Koch to be in breach of the Constitution.
No avail.
Personal details
Peter Frey was born 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
The study of political and education science and Romance studies.
Then he worked for Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, initially to the heute-journal.
Following activities: From 1988 to 1990 personal officer of the editor in chief; in 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and presenter of the Morgenmagazin; then head of the ZDF head studio.
The Greens announced after the vote out of Brender, who was voted journalist of the year by the sector paper Medium Magazin only on Wednesday, to press constitutional charges.
Another opponent on the board of directors, the Rhineland-Palatine Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the states should amend the ZDF treaty to ensure that staff suggestions of the Director cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
Beck also ruled out any removal of party politicians from the board of directors of ZDF.
Peter Frey, the expected successor to the board of directors, was recommended to the board with a clever move - by harshly criticising the committee immediately after it voted out Brender.
Because of this proof of editorial independence, both Schächter without losing face and the board of directors could vote for his appointment as editor-in-chief without being suspected of promoting a partisan to this post.
In party calculations, Frey is considered to be a left-leaning liberal.
University courses to be cleared out
partial success for students: After a year of educational strikes, the state culture ministers finally came around on Thursday: At a meeting of the Culture Minister and University Principals Conference, both parties agreed to improve the conditions of studying for bachelor and masters courses.
The students should, in the future, be in a position to master their studies.
The following agreements were reached to reduce the number of exams: Every module shall, as a rule, be completed with one single exam.
In addition, students' workload shall be evaluated and "a realistic and acceptable extent" is ensured.
Politicians and colleges also want to simplify the recognition of exams taken between the colleges inside and outside Germany.
The States must organise more flexibly joint structural requirements for bachelor and masters courses.
State regulations deviating from this, shall not be imposed.
Less exams
Since the start of the student protests in June, culture ministers and university principals have been referring to the dictum of better studyability.
Now it is being filled with specific contents for the first time.
The so-called accreditation council has decided to dramatically reduce the number of exams: "Every module ends with an exam," states the 30-page paper, which is intended to regulate the admission of courses in part.
With a clear reduction of the examination load, says Grimm, "an unwanted development is stopped, which had a serious impact on studyability".
In addition, "studieability" is to be the core criterion for the organisation in future.
Modules and contents "shall be strictly reviewed" to ensure that "unnecessary restrictions on students in their choice of course material are not necessary"
These events would be prevented.
The students are "right to be granted leeway allowing and promoting initiative".
The rules are applicable for new and review of existing courses.
The courses need to be "reaccredited every five years, which means that it may take up to 2015 to review all courses.
Ten accreditation agencies in Germany oversee this, which report to the Accreditation Council set up by the States.
The culture ministers had "expressly asked the States to influence the agencies in such a way that the number of subjects is not too large and the exam regime not too strict.
In some federal states, universities and colleges have already agreed on similar measures with the state ministries.
Rhineland-Palatine has promiseed additional funding for the further development of the Bologna process; it is the only state to do so.
With this money, the colleges are particularly aimed at setting up tutor programmes and course consultations, strengthening exams and foreign offices.
The state and colleges plan to raise 10 million euros for this.
In early 2010 the government wants to bring an amendment to the University Act before parliament.
According to it, only one exam should be required to complete a course model.
The course design is to become more flexible, and the recognition of past academic records at other universities is to become easier, as well as access to masters courses.
By the end of the coming year, all state courses are to be examined for their studyability.
The government and opposition had again argued over the study requirements in the state on Thursday.
On top of praise, criticism was also made for the decisions.
The federal board of the Young Socialist University Groups asked for the design of education policy to no longer take place "behind the closed doors" of ministers and university principals.
After the educational strike, at least, students should now have their own say as affected.
The future academics received support from the President of the Conference of University Principals (HRK), Margret Wintermantel.
The Education and Science Union (EWU) believed the Bonn decisions to be not radical enough: It is demanding a legal claim, which would allow every graduate with a bachelor degree admission to a further masters course.
The States must ensure that for the current generation of bachelor students there are sufficient places on master courses with best possible study conditions, says GEW Executive Board member Andreas Keller.
The States must employ significantly more lecturers.
The culture ministers did not issue a statement on free admission to masters courses.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
The first line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, which describes in disturbing fragments the experience of a dissident who gained freedom but simultaneously lost his language area.
Werner Söllner, born in Romania's Banat in 1951, initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as an editor in a children's publishing house, before he moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has received several literature awards, in 1993 he was awarded the legendary Frankfurt Poetry Readings at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of Hesse Literature Forum in Mouson Tower in Frankfurt.
The speaker caused a major extra-literary stir last Tuesday at a conference in Munich, discussing "German literature in Romania in the reflection and distortion of its Securitate files".
Then he read out a statement, in which he opened up to his Romano-German fellows, i.e. Richard Wagner, William Totok and Helmuth Frauendorfer, about his participation as an IM for the Romanian secret service, Securitate.
Jointly with some of the present, Söllner 1989 received the German language award in 1989.
The recruiting attempts started gradually, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner continued, "therefore someone who failed to raise sufficient resistance to the intimidation attempts of the Securitate.
The singer Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
The same time as the awarding of the Nobel prize for Herta Müller and her unmatched literary discussion of the mechanisms of dictatorships, the literary scene and particularly the community of German authors with Romanian roots is shocked by a case that reveals the dark spots and perfidiousness of a political system based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner is, as far as possible, not only a perpetrator but also a victim.
In his Securities file, IM Walter played a role, according to Söllner's confession the literary scholar Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence IM Walter had for him.
The FBI “boxed him out in all points which were dangerous for him at the time,” Markel said.
The moral need to make this statement is a moral need.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in this audience, but the confession of a former dissident and his collaboration with the Romanian secret service is not entirely surprising.
The cosy habitat for the Security spies was Germany, as herta Müller already written in July in the Zeit newspaper after reading her own file, 914 pages.
The affected, however, will have guessed and even known whose real name was behind the code names of Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
In contrast to the now very secure process of viewing Stasi files in Germany, the approach to the legacy of Securitate control is still very diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been undermined and hindered in recent years.
National Council to Process Security Files (SNSAS), which is similar to the Birthler Authority, was only set up in 1999, but the release of the files has been very slow.
The law regulating the administration of files has only been established since 2005.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members is still very large in Romania was proven after the announcement of the Nobel prize for Herta Müller by an interview, in which a former Securitate head from Timisoara spoke in derogatory terms of the winner.
The suspect is psychotic, she was questioned more than once.
The infamy of power believed it could openly speak in the guise of freedom of speech.
The Söllner case is, as so often in connection with silent guilt, raising questions.
Why only now? Who was the victim?
The genesis of her work, who yesterday received the Nobel prize, is more than a footnote.
Champions League - a side dish
The field sales representative looked like a well dressed field sales representative was just coming from a very nice Christmas party, where a sports items manufacturer handed out goodies to the new VfB coach Christian Gross in company of a orange plastic bag from the supplier got in the called out Mercedes C class at quarter past midnight.
The man with the swollen bald head still needed a chauffeur, as the town was still unfamiliar to him.
Because no alcohol was involved and the 55-year-old was not drinking.
A nice evening, but tomorrow the work would continue.
Only get going.
The Swiss national told the players, who have only been employed three days before: "We may have reached the last sixteen, but we must not be blind to the success: We are in a very serious fight against relegation.
The far more important task is scheduled for Sunday.
The Champions League performance will have to be replicated in the day-to-day work of the league.
The again revealed weaknesses after the three quick goals by Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.) will have to be stopped.
Draw
The last sixteen of the Champions League (first leg 16/17 + 23/24 February/second leg 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn in Nyon on 18 December.
The happiness over the good start of Babbel’s successor remained mute.
The apparent savior was the only savior, who gave the Stuttgart professionals self-confidence, commitment and joy in playing in a short period of time.
shrink Gross explained his simple recipe for success, which no longer worked under therapist Babbel.
The magic arose, says Babbel fan Lehmann, "When now impulses are given in football, things that were thought to be impossible occur.
The latter, who became the man of the match thanks to his dynamic approach after being injured for weeks, tried to describe the phenomenon with the proverbial "fresh air" and the work approach of the new boss:
It is what we need in the current situation.
Babel was clearly lack of intelligence.
VfB Stuttgart is still not out of thewoods, says sports director Horst Heldt.
The Stuttgart VfB needs consistency.
Like Gross, players and managers were eager to avoid overestimating the win over the depleted and hopelessly overburden defence of the Romanian guests.
The Glasgow team also won in Glasgow before the horribly awakening three days later in Leverkusen in the 0:4, warning Khedira.
The sports director Horst Heldt pointed to one goal of the season, but that the other one was still a long way off.
We are not out of the forest yet.
The fact that Heldt was not in any mood to celebrate on his 40th birthday and even on his first home win for three months was a result of the events of the weekend, which were revived in an TV interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, which was screened immediately before the match.
There are decisions which other people take and not Jens, was Heldt's response to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
The manager was accused of lack of leadership, who had decided to replace the manager under pressure from pubescent fans.
The fact that his day off after matches was cancelled was also considered as a sign of lack of authority and resentment.
These statements were "guided by pure egoism", replied Heldt.
It is unlikely they will become friends for life.
After all, they agreed with everyone else that without the work done by the replaced team of coaches, the strong performance, both in play and spirit, would not have been possible.
Babel and his assistants had "a great share in the success", according to Heldt and Lehmann.
Worldcup heavyweight box match
Heavy duel in Berne: Kevin Johnson kept threatening world champion Vitali Klitchko with words and gestures.
After 12 hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the WBC.
The verdict of the judges was unambiguous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitchko remains world champion.
The 38-year-old champion (the WBC association version) beat the American Kevin Johnson by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
The third successful defence of his title since his comeback in October 2008.
Before, the Ukrainian had already been world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
The knockout, which everyone had expected, was not materialised.
Klitchko extended his record to 39 wins in 41 professional matches, two times he took the field due to injury.
Challenger Johnson saw his first defeat in 24 fights.
The 2.02-metre tall Klitchko aimed to dictate the match with his left hand.
The eleven centimeter shorter Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitchko era before the fight, kept evading the hits from the world champion, meaning that Klitchko was not able to apply a decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
Overall, the passive Johnson did not do enough for a challenger and simply tried to survive the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitchko with words and gestures, his swords only rarely hit the world champion.
The second boxed boxer since Timo Hoffmann in 2000 who took the full twelve rounds against Klitchko is Timo Hoffmann.
The challenger had caused quite a stir in the Swiss capital before the fight.
The elderly fellow called Klitchko as an ugly zombie, who cannot do anything.
The champion then allowed himself to knock Johnson's sunglasses off his nose to see into his eyes.
Fourth victory after Klitchko's return
Klitchko took the fourth fight since his comeback on 11 October 2008.
After a four year sabbatical, he beat the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and re-claimed his WBC belt.
This year he then took the title to Cuban Juan Carlos Gomez from and Chris Arreola from the US in September.
However, I only took one blow in this fight and am physically in good shape, Klitchko said after quick return to the ring.
The goal remains to unify all important titles in his family.
Vladimir is world champion of WBO and IBF associations.
The WBA belt is now worn by British David Haye after he dethroned the 2.13-metre tall Nikolay Valuev in November.
Haye previously cancelled in summer a fight against Vitali Klitchko.
According to his promotion company, they are now planning a fight against Klitchko at London's Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green party head Jürgen Trittin calls defence minister Guttenberg a liar for providing false information on Kunduz affair.
SPD and Left Party demand clarification from the Chancellor.
- After recent revelations regarding the air raid of Kunduz, the opposition has accused defence minister Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberate deception.
The minister apparently made "knowingly false statements" about the fatal bombing of two tank trailers in September, according to the ARD news programme Tagesschau.
This is generally referred to as lying.
The order to kill was given in defiance of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) for Afghanistan.
The substance of the report, which NATO had, which Mr Guttenberg has read, said Trittin.
The attack was not only about destroying the abducted tankers, but also to specifically kill two Taleban leaders.
The US air strike ordered by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, resulting in 142 people killed and injured, according to the NATO investigation report.
The Greens, SPD and Linke called on Merkel to address parliament immediately and clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Angela Merkel must clarify whether a targeted killing strategy is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy, and whether the Chancellor's Office, German army and Intelligence Service have approved this new strategy, asked Trittin and Künast.
Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism without further acknowledgement.
The Chancellor Office did not have any influence on specific missions of the German army in Afghanistan, he added.
On Saturday, doubts over the presentation by the ministry of the background of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert emerged.
The two provided Guttenberg with correct and complete information on the background of the tanker trailer attack.
Officially, they lied about the existence of the NATO reports and kept sensitive details from the minister.
The entourage of the top official reported that the Ministry of Defence had also been directed to several documents, including two pages of the commanding colonel Klein and a report from the military police.
In the meantime, Wichert is supposed to have asked for clarification in a letter, reports the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.
The claim is that he has not received a response, it is claimed.
The ministry did not comment on the accusations on Saturday and referred to the fact that this would be clarified by the inquiry committee of the parliament, which will be set up on Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images and hear voices when they are awake, which others do not see or hear.
However, only in mentally sick and during drug intoxication can the borders between imagination and reality blur.
As long as this happens in sleep, things are fine.
When we are in dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can fully submit to the wildest imaginations and fantasies without restraint.
The person who experiences dreamlike conditions or seeing and hearing things other people do not when they are awake is considered to be a madman or drug addict, or strange at least.
These images and voices are not only in mentally sick or drug intoxication.
This is down to our imagination: The same brain processes that allow us to design houses, draw paintings or write novels can make the borders between dream, madness and reality blurred.
Thoughts which are warped like dreams can occur in many different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
If the triggers and effects may differ, the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, drug experiences of New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shaman detached from reality conditions, psychosis and hallucinations can be traced to similar processes.
Hallucination or delusions occur when the brain balance of the nerve transmitters - mainly dopamine noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - collapses and the interaction of different brain segments is dysfunctional.
Complex halucinations and delusional thoughts often occur during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity no longer has any power over him.
The connection between madness and dream has been a subject of philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristoteles thought hallucinations to be a form of dream while awake, Wilhelm Griesinger, the founder of modern psychiatry, detected in 1861 a "huge similarity between madness and dreamlike conditions", and Sigmund Freud believed that dreams were even "psychosis" with all the puzzles, delusions and misconceptions of such.
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
The body is two-dimensional and excessively gaudy.
Gravity no longer has any power over him, he floats at the ceiling of the room.
The kick is coming.
Behind him are winged devilish figures with red, distorted faces, snarling.
They hunt him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him on walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Evil voices appear from the wall and radio.
The voices that abuse and insult him are no longer his priority.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo system, ties them to a knot and attaches it to a hook on the ceiling.
The speaker climbs on a speaker and places the noose around his neck.
He jumps.
The nose becomes loose.
It is a lesson to you, the voices scream in an ear-piercing choir, "go to the clinic and get treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has six acute psychosis, the last one two years back, the first almost 20 years ago.
It was caused by LSD.
The diagnosis is a schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, and he takes drugs against depression, mania and schizophrenia.
The illness has become a household routine, and he has been married for three years.
In psychosis I experienced the worst fear and deepest desperation, he says.
The illusions are a brutal reality.
About 1 percent of the population goes through at least once in their life with schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated with a frequency only second to depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, people who are affected are overexcited, which can result in hallucinations, megalomania, paranoia or persecution mania.
Particularly common is hearing voices - voices that command, comment or participate in dialogue.
Visual halucinations are also rare.
The affected person can no longer distinguish important things from unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, and the conscious is flooded with impressions.
Like dreams, psychosis also opens the floodgates for a flood of ideas and phantasms, which are coming from deeper levels of the conscious.
The perception of reality in a psychosis is subject-centred, says professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Clinic for General Psychiatry at the University Clinic of Heidelberg.
Schizophrenic patients are at the heart of events, the meaning of everything is given to him.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he is, like in a dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot affect them actively.
Schizophrenic patients often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
The reality comparison is often not available to them, the illusions are a brutal reality, awakening is not possible.
To experience a hallucination once in your life
While dreams are often absent, Fuchs says, "the sensual and spatial structure of reality, as perceived during a psychosis, remains intact as a rule".
The delusional thoughts and halucinations are based on reality, the distortion of events occurs within a reality framework.
Precisely why our brain plays such tricks on us is still unclear to scientists.
Special circumstances can cause any person to lose his sense of reality for a short period of time, says Fuchs.
However, not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic tendency to schizophrenia, but studies of twins have shown that genes are not the only factor.
Scientists assume that patients have minimal brain damage.
Fuchs says that neuronal maturation of the brain occurs in an early stage of development, through a virus infection in the mother during pregnancy, for example.
It is still a mystery how neuronal disturbances occur, which do not appear for many years initially.
Environment impacts also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger psychosis if the disposition is given.
Hallucinogen drugs can trigger psychosis, as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brain runs hot, our brain goes hot.
The mad thing is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them, says Lübeck-based psychology professor Erich Kasten.
The degree to which illusions are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often only a matter of perspective.
Kasten has been collecting reports for ten years on hallucinations and delusions, and last year he assessed his results in a book titled The unreal World in our Head.
Hallucinations are a common byproduct of psychosis, but also of a remarkable number of other diseases.
These include, on top of mental illnesses such as borderline or depression, also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy or Alzheimer's disease and brain injury.
However, even the brain of healthy people shallucinate under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, says Kasten, are memories that are often held back.
The causes of these disorders occur when brain areas, where sensory perceptions are processed, are overactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brain runs hot and also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as much as brain damage or a psychosis.
However, sensory deprivation, stress, love or other mental disorders also occur.
In recent studies, up to one third of respondents claimed to have experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and goes to the local secondary school.
In fact, a perfectly normal girl.
It was not for the images and voices.
During breaks, a young boy with long dark hair approaches her.
When she answers him, her schoolmates look at her in surprise - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
The girls are a typical daydreamer, but Sarah K. is not dreaming.
She is awake, she sees and hears this boy, just like she sees and hears the girl at the desk next to her.
She can even feel his presence for some moments.
The feeling is a good feeling, she likes the boy.
I am mad? she sometimes asks.
Then she knows that this boy and other illusions are not real and disappear again.
At night the appearances are usually threatening.
The illusions are often a strain.
When she is sitting in the classroom she sometimes cannot follow because the teacher is behind her eyes and ears introducing a new schoolmate, while she is explaining mathematical equations on the blackboard for everyone else.
At night the appearances are usually threatening.
When she is waiting for sleep in her dark room, which rarely and late, she cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees, the grimaces or the girl with bleeding arms and legs is standing in front of her open or closed eyes.
Let me be, she screams at the figures.
She does not tell her parents or friends anything about this, they would think she was mad.
Sarah K. is 20 years old now.
She completed her A level last year and is now living with her boyfriend.
Year ago the illusions stopped.
Since she contacted Kasten via the Internet, she knows that she is not mad.
Madness is also art born out of desperation.
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from sensory deprivation, he will very likely suffer from hallucinations after some time, says Kasten.
I assume that the brain is not busy enough and creates its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children when she was small.
The illusions started when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she called dad since she could think was not her natural father.
Because the brain becomes active, those areas of the brain that also process real impressions and sounds, it is often difficult for patients like Sarah K. to distinguish between illusion and reality.
Hallucinations are also images, which the brain creates, this is why they seem so real.
Illusions at night are also classified by Kasten as a form of hallucination.
The healthy persons illusions are not fundamentally different from those during acute psychosis.
While schizophrenic patients can identify illusions as unreal, mentally healthy people are able to identify illusions as unreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate hallucinations as a special ability.
Difference between dream and hallucination
In our far too conscious-centred world, imaginary experiences are often unfortunately pathologic, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and senior physician of the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, painful disease, but it also brings positive aspects, creativity - madness is also a work of art born out of desperation.
Since Schmidt-Degenhard has been researching oneiroid experience, a particular form of conscious conditions that are warped like dreams.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed, quasi-dreams, which the person experiencing them believes are real and which he later cannot distinguish from being awake.
Oneiroid syndrome occurs in extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis in full consciousness.
If a person is threatened by self- or world loss, for example due to persistent, complete loss of mobility, he replaces the real situation with an imaginary world, which is uncoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A border between dream and hallucination.
As understanding a situation is not possible in reality, a world change occurs, but the real situation is not updated in the imagination.
The intense form of creating and applying meaning in an unbearable situation, which allows us to use our own ability to design and not go under in the emptyness of consciousness.
All is real, even later in memory.
The Zurich-based art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book A Change of Heart as the sole's effort to protect itself.
The elderly is 49 years old when his consciousness takes off on journeys for days after heart valve surgery with subsequent heart transplant while his body is damned to immobility in the intensive care unit.
Claussen travels across the world, visits foreign places and times, and experiences himself as a sick, old man on a train, a robot watching his health.
The disease occurs in the early Middle Ages among noblemen who make blood intoxicants.
The man is abducted by a Greek man on his motorbike to his homeland, surfs with his hospital bed in the spring snow of the Alps and meets a Korean member of the mafia.
The entire event is real, even later in his memory.
The inner trips, Claussen believes, are fundamentally different from every dream.
Dream is different, he describes his experience.
Contrary to that, the memories from mental trips are very clear to me even after years and minute detail.
Even clearer and more intense than real events.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our daily experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Overall, oneiroids, psychosis, hallucinations and drug intoxication show how fragile our external reality is, even when awake.
Every change to the conscious, says Kasten, can result in a warping of what we call reality.
An experience that can indeed be enriching.
snow can come.
Burda
Children set to take over the publishing house at the age of 27
Kallen, the new head of Burda publishing, is an interim solution: In the long term, Burda wants his company to be taken over by his two children, he has told the SPIEGEL magazine.
The holding is to remain to 100% in the family.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees the long-term future of his company in his children's hands.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and are strongly interested in joining the company, the 69-year-old has told the SPIEGEL magazine.
The details have been organised as a precaution.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will only arise later.
Also the question of whether they can do so.
One cannot place one’s children in charge of 7,500 employees if they are not capable of doing this.
That will kill children, and the company with them.
The announcement was made on Thursday that he would be resigning from his position as Chairman for January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the board at Burda since 1999.
The initial role of the technology manager was technical.
Then with the Treasury department he assumed responsibility for the company assets, and after Jürgen Todenhöfer's departure, for direct marketing, foreign operations, print and finance.
First time, a person who is not a family member is thus at the helm of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17; his son Felix, who would be 42 today, died a couple years ago.
The appointment of Kallen is designed to bridge 10, 15 years, says Burda.
The holding is to remain 100 percent in family ownership, said Burda.
The case of Schickedanz and Schaeffler always involved families with a capital addiction, who speculated wrongly and through that they could advance to become a really big player.
That never was my strategy.
The latter never had "world power" dreams, says Burda.
I do not see myself as a country political preceptor, as Springer was, and I do not want to participate in the world league with Time magazine, as they have become too large.
Comprehensive Beauty
All you can want in terms of beauty and comfort - at your fingertips.
This is what El Corte Ingles, which recently opened a multi-disciplinary space dedicated to bodycare and pampering in Callao (Madrid) shopping centre, seems to be aiming for.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious firms like Hedonai, offering laser hair removal; Spaxión, with relaxation and beauty treatment rooms; Luis & Tachi, a hairdresser; Marina d'Or, which has a gym; and L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics.
The food section also features a teashop with more than 130 different types of tea.
Enjoying a relaxing massage with your partner while you look out over the city, or renting out the relax area for 2 hours to have your own 'beauty party' with eight friends and relaxing with a jacuzzi session, massages, and drinking a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities that Spaxión offers.
The total area of 250 m2 is distributed among 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Examples include cavitation to combat cellulitis, or vibration platforms.
The gym has these machines, along with virtual trainers guiding the steps of the clients, providing them a totally personalized treatment.
Everything starts by entering your personal key on the touch screen behind the machine.
Then, various videos show us how to properly perform our workout plan.
The Director guarantees that 15 minutes (including warm up and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles in the body.
If after our workout we want to drop by the hairdressers,Luis & Tachi provides a salon where they offer personal hair services to restore its brilliance and nutrition.
The philosophy of this urban spa is innovation and exclusivity, which will be open every day of the year from 10:00 in the morning to 10:00 at night.
Variated necklines
Thanksgiving is approaching, and it never hurts to revisit the look of stars to suit our holiday wardrobe.
The neckline, very important for enhancing the silhoutte, is one of the facts we should take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. This is not recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona with electric cars
The electric company Endesa, together with Barcelona City Council, has created 'Office LIVE.'
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city, and will define the conditions for mobility, management, coordination, present subsidies, etc.
Moreover, MOVELE will develop the project, promote the electric car, review public opinion and work with the involved sectors.
In short, it hopes to promote what will be the future transport.
3 'electric cities'
The city of Barcelona is not the only city that will participate in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joining the project.
The three cities selected by the Government to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle in the MOVELE plan.
The electric company Endesa has already signed a Framework Agreement with the Catalonian Republic.
With that, it aims to promote the activities of Research and Technological Development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
This include activities related to energy and particularly energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative that Endesa is involved in regard to the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in European standardization groups and has a series of active complementary projects, such as G4V, ELVIRE and CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees a horizon of peace for the automotive sector.
The Prime Minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, looks at a 'peace horizon' for the Spanish automotive industry, which is the main export sector in the country.
In the Prime Minister's presentation of the Economic Report for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures the government has taken to support the automotive sector.
Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a panorama of neglect and the closure of some of our major production plants.
Through this plan and arrangement of the brands to continue in this highly competitive sector in Spain, we can have a peaceable future for this industry, which is our main export sector.
The Competitiveness Plan, included in the Automotive Industry Comprehensive Plan (PIA), provided 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized more than 3 billion euros.
The Executive Branch head explained that this investment was aimed at the development of new models as well as upgrading existing products and processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government's efforts to support the demand, including the 2000E Plan, implemented in collaboration with the Autonomous Communities and automotive brand.
The Prime Minister says this plan has reduced emissions by 6% in new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and has led to a "sharp increase" in enrollment, which rose by 40% in November.
20,000 square feet of classic vehicles.
The first year of the International Classic Car Showroom will be celebrated in Madrid, a meeting place for professional and amateur motorists.
This initiative will be held from 5th to 7th of February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
This is a 20,000 square meter exhibition area, and more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be there.
ClassicAuto Madrid will not only have classic motorcycles and cars, but also all kinds of products related to motor world.
The exhibitors at the pavilion will display accessories, parts, components, textiles, accessories, complements, publications, miniatures, etc.
The hundreds of items related to classic motors will delight collectors and the curious.
Companies will include Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, automobile sales and restoration; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, automobile sales and restoration; and Cocher Clásicos, Mercedes Benz specialists.
Outdoor skills tests.
The business of this Showroom will also include parallel activities: rallies, sports exhibitions, skills tests, presentation and competitions.
Skills tests in classic cars and motorcycles will also take place on an authorised track outside the exhibition site.
Mazda3 iStop: Sustainable sportsmanship
Mazda wants to show that sportsmanship is not incompatible with the environment.
The Mazda3 has just added an engine stop and start system - dubbed as the i-Stop - a mechanism that is, for the moment, only available with the 150 horsepower 2.0 petrol engine.
This second generation of the Mazda3 is known for its high ratings.
The finishes, features, comfort, performance, mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Following the driver's seat, we see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomic and support.
The feel of the steering wheel is also wonderful.
Following the dashboard and console, we see how Mazda continues to continue the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior with buttons, knobs and stunning red and blue colors.
This style reminds us of the Honda Civic.
The Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of the German products, more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the interior, this Japanese compact is easily roomy enough for four adults to travel in great comfort.
All this comes with a spacious trunk and standard dimension.
The engine's automatic stop and start system, at least for now, is only available with the two-liter, 150 horse-power, manual, six gear, petrol engine.
This engine is a real delight. What makes it outstanding is its subtlety, reduced noise levels, features and fuel consumption.
The diesel versions of the Madzda3 will be more popular, but those who do not drive much a year should not ignore this i-Stop petrol engine system, both for its elevated driving comfort and its low fuel consumption.
The equipment level is called the Sportive, meaning it includes a high number of standard elements.
The standard equipment is excellent, especially the lane changing assistant (RVA) which eliminates blind spot, the traction and stability control, the speed control, the large-screen onboard computer, rain and lights sensor, Bluetooth and Bluetooth audio, and 17" alloy wheels.
Additionally, with less equipment, this version also comes with the Premium Pack, which for 1,500 euros, includes: bi-xenon adaptive headlights and a Bose sound system with CD changer, among other things.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in its category.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the quality of the materials used, its performance, and the high standard of its equipment.
Additionally, those who do less yearly mileage can opt for this version of the i-Stop, associated only with the 150-horsepower 2.0 engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which ranges from 21,770 euros for the Luxury pack to 23,270 euros for the Sportive version, tested here.
In exchange for high price, the Mazda3 will offer a large daily dose of satisfaction.
Deluxe 'Premiere'
L. A. covers the red carpet of sensuality by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars were more stunning than ever, wrapped in designer dresses, as elegant as they were sexy at the premiere of 'Nine'.(Photos: Gtresonline)
Our own 'Pe', as sophisticated as ever, chose a dark 'lady.'
The promise of FonPeek
However, Peek is extremely limited, a device that is only used for checking email, without any feature for viewing certain attachments or browsing the web.
It enjoyed its 5 minutes of fame in the US when Time Magazine named it one of the year’s products.
The street is more difficult to see, but the idea can be interesting, especially for children.
The Peek is very cheap and has a low monthly fee, less than half of the iPhone's data plan.
Following its success, the company has released two new devices: one exclusively for Twitter, and the other with a free data service for life in exchange for six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented at the La Web event yesterday, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is limited as its US counterpart, but offers a surprise.
The monthly service cost, around 12 euros a month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
The ones who travel with a smartphone know what it is like to give up data when crossing the border or desperately search for a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to check their mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and long awaited.
However, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
The repeated twisting of the European Commission's arm to get affordable roaming rates across Europe has had little effect.
There is a fear of using data outside one's home country, and rightly so.
For a gadget like the FonPeek (it no longer seems strange to be called Fon since it lacks WiFi) to get this kind of fee, it means that the operators are starting to think differently and study different ways to recover the cost of their data networks.
The Kindle is another good example, with a book downloading feature and other internet queries.
No contracts, no complaints.
It is a connected device and is paid for when it is purchased, not month by month.
The same thing I hope to see one day with FonPeek, a life-long call option with life-time access, which the Peek already has in the USA.
Not because I am going to buy it.
I check my mail on my phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it is unfair for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's color fetish
Yellow is without a doubt the US First Lady's favorite color.
The actress already attended Obama's inauguration as President in a yellow dress and coat, and she chose to accompany him to the second most important moment of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar dress both times: apart from being yellow-green with bright highlights-, both times the dress was three parts, a dress, jacket and coat of the same material, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
The first lady of the US seems to have followed the lead of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to replicate her dress.
The material the two suits are made of makes them very different.
If the inauguration was about thick lace, in Oslo it was patterned velvet.
The accessories have also changed: green medium-heeled shoes once, and now a similar design but in gold.
The same is the hair style: on this occasion, hair tied back; previously she wore her hair down.
75% of working mothers have work problems during maternity.
Recent increases in work discrimination have been seen among young women who want to be mothers.
This has been revealed by a study titled 'Fertility and work history of women in Spain', developed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women’s Institute.
The survey of 9,737 women from 15 to 75 years old leaves no doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen their work opportunities reduced due to maternity.
The study notes that there are many different ways couples start cohabiting, in the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they do.
The ones who have no activity outside the home, work part time, or have no stable job start living with their partner soon, expect their first child, and have more children.
By contrast, women with a stable job, especially in the public sector, avoid cohabitation and motherhood and have less offspring.
Females between 35 and 49 years old with steady work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting to live together, a figure that increases to 4.1; women with steady work need more time to achieve their lifelong goals, which has led them to postpone married and having children.
Additionally, the type of job held has a great influence over maternity but less over the mating schedule.
Education is another factor that differentiates the age of women marrying and having their first child.
The higher the education level, the younger the age at which they get married and have their first child.
There was also a difference among women from the same generation.
In a group of 35- to 49-year-olds, those who had elementary and those who have higher education become mothers averagely at 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
Their education level provides yet another division among women.
While those who have an elementary education marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have secondary or higher education reverse the sequence and give priority to finding a stable job as a precondition to marriage and having a child are given priority to finding a stable job as a precondition to marriage and having a child are Delgado says.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its Ambassador list: Diane Kruger.
Since next year, the German actress will be the image of the brand's different products, singing the universal slogan 'Because I am worth it.'
The star of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the best actresses on the international scene, joins other celebrity signed to L'Oreal Paris, like Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell and the Spaniard Penelope Cruz.
After her, the last to enter such a elite club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millionaire').
The men's line also includes deluxe ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's co-star on 'Lost').
The British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in fashion.
The top representatives - designers and models, past and present - gathered at the annual award presentation, which took place in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
Nobody missed the date.
The former model Jerry Hall'sdaughter, Georgia May Jagger, was chosen as Model of the Year.
Poker by Manuel Vicent
In 'Four Aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) Manuel Vicent gives us thirty profiles of writers who have lived through their literary life (and in some cases, the other one too).
The character is not created in predictable or terrible ways (biography, life and work), but in a way that would have a cause for it.
The trip has its excitement, and Vincent us does not spare any scars or illuminations.
In addition to being an exquisite pleasure, the book is a touching invitation to read and reread.
Here are some snippets.
In Albert Camus' pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual instinct, almost physical, the same one I felt without giving it a name: pleasure against the ill-fated, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god.
Samuel Beckett: "Nihilistic, allegorical Christian, he wrote what was in his blood, not in his intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a brilliant poetic humor, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him.
On Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in which flesh combined the excitement of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that is reaching heaven through the road of perdition.
The following remarks are from James Joyce: "Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the eight thousand-meter peaks of world literature that must be scaled by the north face, which the best mountain climbers repeatedly climb off time and time again."
William Faulker: "He was a weird guy."
Then he sometimes claimed that he was the heir to a landowner in the county, and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
"They both dreamed of grandeur."
The writer took the deranged scream from a bridge in order to carry his eco, under his literary form, into the dark night of the 20th century, and made it a journey, hiding from himself and calling on the past with a violent discourse to the worms.
On Dorthy Parker: "One day she kneled and prayed: 'Dear God, I beg you to stop writing like a woman'.
On Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were engraved these verses from Spencer: 'Sleep after work,/port after stormy seas,/ease after war,/ death after life is greatly pleased.'

Aggression
The week after my mother was walking through our neighborhood in Fuenlabrada, a group of children between 15 and 18 years old passed by and, without a word, kicked the dog twice, leaving the dog very injured.
The indignation was without bounds because we cannot see the fun in a false aggression towards a small and unprotected animal, which by way, was on a leash.
The woman who was walking alone, when she reprimanded them, started to fear for her safety, because a lunatic who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same to a woman, a child, an elderly person, and, certainly, to anyone weaker than himself.
The incident occurred on Tuesday at five o'clock in the afternoon in what is usually a quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By way, we filed a complaint at a close police station which we doubt means much, not to stir trouble, but to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is going on when young people become lazy to mistreat a defenseless animal which gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We do not know if there is any politeness and respect for animals and people left.
Michelin and Fesvial united on helmets
Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially among young motorists, both organizations reported today.
This initiative is aimed at raising awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, because it is the only way to prevent head injuries and even death in an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin added that this campaign is part of their road safety commitment, which goes beyond designing and producing safe products every day, and added that it also contributes to this goal by providing educational and informative measures.
The new campaign promoting helmet use in motorcycles, under the motto 'To be or not to be' will initially distributes posters to more than 500 motorcycle shops to spread the message as widely as possible.
Following the meeting, Michelin stressed that road safety is a constant concern for the company, as a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, its main goal is to develop ever safer products.
Light commercial vehicles on the rise
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent a rise of 12.6% from 2008, and, more importantly, the first increase after 22 months of decline, according to figures from the manufacturers association (ANFAC) and the vendors association (GANVAM).
However, it is not time to start celebrating since the reference to November 2008 was particularly poor, with a 60% decrease from the previous year.
The outcome is that, despite last month's upturn, the total number of registrations during those 11 months is 40% below last year's.
Since January, 95,853 units of all the vehicle classes that make up the hotchpotch of light commercial vehicles have been sold: derived vans, pick ups, vans, light vans and light-chassis trucks.
The storm clouds affecting demand have not completely cleared, so even though individuals also purchase these products, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, most of which rely on external funding.
The restrictions caused by closed tap bank loans require addition of other factors such as increasing unemployment and persistent economic decline.
In light of this, as with cars, the 2000Epurchase has done little.
Outside from individuals, provisions are made for self-employed and SMEs that are going to purchase a light commercial vehicle of up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of transactions has been limited.
Today, the need for the Administration to focus on these vehicles and also to commercial vehicles (trucks and buses) was called upon by GANVAM.
The seller's association predicts that 2010 will be similar to the year leading up to the close, which estimates a 19% drop in sales (passenger cars and 4x4s).
Support for emergency braking is already obligatory.
Support systems to emergency brakes will have to be mandatory in European cars, as it happened with anti-lock breaks (ABS) and will happen with stability control (ESP).
In fact, they are already in all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while the rest have a grace period until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase pedestrian safety, but how they work can also prevent many rear-end collisions.
What the emergency brake assistant does is increase the pressure on the brakes in an emergency, which the system detects through the driver's pressing the pedal.
This does not always keep that pressure through to the end.
According to a study conducted by the car components manufacturer, Bosch, a third of drivers in an accident had not brake before the collision and half of them did not use full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of aid requires full braking system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this feature, 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented in a year.
The reduction will be even bigger - it estimates that one in four accidents would be preventable - when the so-called smart emergency braking systems become popular.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (via radar or camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, along with lightly applying the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If he does not react, and even though the collision is unavoidable, the device uses the maximum force to the brakes to minimise damage.
General Motors delays Opel plan until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueres (Zaragoza) have been informed by Nick Reilly, the new Meriva will start production in the first week of April -probably the 8th- as reported by Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer is cautioning that more time is needed to finalize the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, new president of GM Europe, wants each point of the new plan to have prior approval from the affected party.
This may delay the final document, which will be sent first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, until the start of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is making sure that a decision regarding the sale of Saab should be made in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Sweden government has increased the pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contacts with potential new buyers.
The most likely candidate is Volvo, but the option of Skyper, which is funded by the Russian group Converg, is growing.
In the event that no of them agree to an agreement, GM would be able to sell some Saab assets to the Chinese Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold remains.
Porsche Boxster Spyder
Their most precious gem, the Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed to trim it by no less than 80 kilos, making the total weight a mere 1,275 kilos.
Then, they started by removing the automatic roof, which has been replaced by a manually operated canvas one, saving 21 kilos; replacing the automatic roof with a manually operated canvas one, saving 14 kilos; using aluminum doors, saving 14 kilos; using bucket seats, another 12, and with the 19-inch lightweight wheels, another 12; using aluminum doors, saving 14 kilos; using aluminum doors, saving 14 kilos; using aluminum doors, saving 7 kilos; using aluminum doors, saving 7 kilos; using aluminum doors, saving 7 kilos; using aluminum wheels, saving 7 kilos; using aluminum wheels, saving 7 kilos; using aluminum wheels, another 12; using aluminum wheels, another 12; and with the 19-inch lightweight wheels, another 12; and with the 19-inch wheels, another 12; and with the 19-inch wheels, another 12; and with the 19-inch wheels, another 12;
Finally, avoiding the CDR-30 sound system took it down another 6 kilograms, and changing the door handles to fabric ones cut the remaining kilo.
The test was conducted on a unit with the six-speed manual transmission, mainly on backroads of California and along really windy mountain roads.
It can only be described as a very good performance.
The reduction in weight does not imply that the car does not grip the asphalt.
The complete opposite is the case: It has been a long time since we have tested a model so small and light, which, in turn, transmits so much confidence when cornering, even at high speeds.
It is a small athlete, able to warm up its muscles in low gear for as long as we need, then ordered to sprint, to brake, to recover and go back to the engine...
The car will do what we ask for.
It will do it with surgical precision.
Optional engine noise
The sound of its V6 boxer with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Panamera S) is well made and can be enhanced with the sport option and a system that modifies the roar of the engine, which was introduced in the Panamera S.
The acceleration is brutal, either from a standstill or recovering.
The suspension is firm but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the highways we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was fairly beaten, but the car handled the potholes well.
The electronic aids rarely showed up on the course, because, well into the morning, we found early morning ice and gravel on some curves.
In short, it is an ultra lightweight car, one of the most fun to drive on the market, and is a bit more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,931 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Close to Karl Lagerfeld, the image of Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlet' of the catwalk, the singer takes on her bad-girl image with as much contempt as she has Chanel bags.
More than a 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', she is a'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia gives away a victory in Israel
They took a stunning 82-91 victory on their visit to Maccabee Electra court despite Dusko Ivanovic's team's heavy losses, and after the great performance by Mizra Teltovic, who was the best on his team with eight three-pointers scored (29 points), they now are in the top four of the group.
The Vitorian team knew how to make up the significant absences of Herrmann, Oleson and Micov with a huge dose of involvement and team work, even though it took out the final stages to take the victory.
Additionally, their huge success from the sidelines, with 16 three pointers scored, had a major impact on the final victory.
The game started out with the Azulgranas leading the scoreboard from the start.
As Vitora's first four baskets were from the border, the speculation was already that they might have slipped into the Israeli net with hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main scorer of the 18-20 at the end of the first period.
The second quarter was more similar, but the Alavan team chose to use the inside game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu to continue increasing their lead by half-time (34-43).
Teletovic had already started to appear as the best on his team with 13 points, but Splitter's "six fewer" points already signaled that it was not the best night for the Brazilian.
The game, despite being headed for half time, was not more decided, and with the 'hand of Elias' being used, they managed to get involved in the game.
Eidson and Pnini played a key role in the "yellows' return to the light.
More disadvantages
However, Ivanovic's players, injured but far from dead, needed to run a couple of plays correctly before they could breathe, and that's when the machine gun Marza Teletovic arrived, with three almost consecutive three-pointers and the help of English and Ribas, he took the lead (54-67), which the home team managed to narrow it to 57-67.
The Alavas worked themselves to the bone in the last period, and English and San Emeterio (65-75) had already made clear that they would not allow anybody to take away what they had earned during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best on their team, kept their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
In spite of this, and with Splitter out, Ivonic's team played well, defended well and, even though the Israelis came close at the last minute, the game was already won.
Injuries prevent Unicaja's fight
Unicaja lost miserably in Greece against Olympiacos and took the lead in Group B of the Euroleague in a game marked by the loss of the cajistas, especially in the inside game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald) which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not satisfied by the atmosphere in the Peace and Friendship Stadium, nor by the excellence of its rival, probably the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The playing of the first quarter allowed the Andalusian team to take easy. An aggressive defense and three consecutive three-pointers, two from Cook and one from Gubio, stunned the home team 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos were a bit surprised by Unicaja's intensity, but the home team's arsenal in the inside game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis took them back to 22-20 in the 13th minute, which ended with a fight between Beverley and Williams resulting in disqualification of both players.
The Greek team started showing their superiority inside both zones, where the loss of English center Joel Freeland to injury and three personal fouls by Carlos Jimenez hindered the Greeks.
The inside players and the Lithuanian forward, Linas Leizas, with their three points, added the lead to 44-32 in the 19th minute.
An impossible comeback
The second period was very offensive for Olympiacos, who, despite 19 losses, proved superior and started to even the difference in the game in Malaga, making it 66-48 in the 27th minute, which shocked the group leader.
Unicaja tried to overcome their absences and the latest withdrawal of the Scottish centre, Robert Archibald, who was injured during the game.
However, thanks to Cook's control and three-pointers, and Lewis' assists, Unicaja remained hopeful with the score at 66-57 in the 31st minute.
The entire fight was practically impossible because Olympiacos, when pressed and given their superiority, seemed unstoppable once centimeters inside the zone.
The Croatian center, Nikola Vujcic, managed to bring back the basket average to 81-62 in 37 minutes and Unicaja gave up.
How much should you charge for Facebook profile?
Users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile thanks to a new application Trovit, the most important search engine for real-estate, employment and car classifieds in Spain.
The tool "How much should you charge?" estimates the wage of users from more than 140,000 employment offers in Spain on Trovit, based on a form available on Facebook, where you must enter your profession, years of experience, age and city.
In the week that the application was launched, the search engine found that the Spanish worker "feels underpaid," said the Trovit Product Manager, Albert Ribera.
The data Trovit uses from its search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the lowest paid.
The British programmer charges 45,226 euros gross per year, and a French one 31,059, compared to the 24,000 a Spaniard receives.
Similarly, a driver receives an annual net pay of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France, and 16,420 in Spain.
The lowest paid job in Spain is waiter, with annual net earnings of 11,592 euros; followed by salesperson, with 14,725 euros, and operator with 15,667 euros.
The most searched for jobs on the net in the past three months are driver, part-time jobs and social worker.
Brazil sets release date for Zelaya
The Brazil Government has set a deadline on Manuel Zelaya's stay in the Embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the Embassy by 27th January 2010 at the latest, when his mandate officially ends.
According to TV Globo, "Mel" knows that he must leave the Embassy before 21st September.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27th, the end of his term; he has to look for another occupation."
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I plan to leave as soon as possible, with the support of the Brazil government."
After the November 29 elections (in which Profiro Lobo was elected), Zelaya said that he would stay in the Embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to find refuge in Brazil.
The operation ended unsuccessfully with the rejection of Zelaya's political refugee status, which the Government headed by Roberto Micheletti tried to impose "de facto".
Thanks a lot.
After a few days of wine and roses last spring, when inflation was the dominant trend on the markets, uncertainty again appears, which is not surprising since it is natural in an environment where agents make decisions about the naturally uncertain future.
The cure for the crisis was to monetize debt by direct purchase of assets and indirectly give open bar liquidity at close to zero rates so that financial institutions could buy deductible assets.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically ended and, without questioning their unorthodox liquidity policy, are beginning to throw a spanner in the works as the ECB makes its yearly auction next week.
The investors believe that the global economy can survive economic recovery without such unorthodox measures, and we are seeing a reversal of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock markets and the corporate bond spreads have swiftly picked up, but they are still far behind the extreme levels that they reached in the first half of the year.
The States were obligated to socialize private risk, and again public debt is going to be affected.
Again quality flight is a priority for investors, and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refugee of choice for investors, causing a widespread spread of the Eurozone countries with regard to Germany.
Spanish stability seems to have been affected by this period of instability, but that's when Standard and Poor's arrived and threatened a new revision, downgrading Spain.
Additionally, some uncertainty cannot silence moral hazard defenders, who again tried to raise awareness of the role of credit restrictions on job loss, when what is needed is to declare a new Thanksgiving day.
However, Dubai's paints with a tribal fight between the Emirs to restore power in the emirates, and we have seen it before in Greece.
A Government which hides the public deficit, elections and a new Government that pulls up the rug.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Barroso.
It is not logical that Ecofin saved Hungry from a breach of its external payments in the beginning of the year, and that it will allow a Euro member-country to fail to fulfil its commitments.
What is logical is that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent, and to make its citizens jointly responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain public finances.
If we find ourselves before a standardized period of transient risk premiums, after some excess of leveraged positions, it would be within our expectations.
In Spain, since our public debt is spreading like European corporate bonds, we should not be concerned.
If European spreads decrease and ours continue to expand, then it would be an idiosyncratic risk for Spain.
The case of Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our leading indicators are driving most research services to anticipate its recovery scenarios and revise its 2011 scenario, including the OECD and the European Commission, they return to the fray with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, and long life expectancy does not warrant its warning.
Again, it has all the evidence to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, but for now, "prudence, my driver."
Related sectors
The Iberdrola Chairman, Ignacio Sanchez Galan, was the first to speak yesterday before the House of Representatives, where Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades is currently debated.
After his speech, followed by the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galan gave the press a few glimpses of what was planned in the subcommittee behind closed doors.
The president of Iberdrola says Spain will need to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion by that date and 2030, while operating the existing nuclear power plants.
Otherwise, the investments will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
Yes, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be spent on increasing its capacity, but on distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 on, the matter will change and the power will increase.
The betting is on both coal plants with carbon dioxide catchers and, especially, renewable energy sources.
In this case, he considers that it takes 18,000 new MW, and that is with "support energy."
Though he believes that the Sustainable Economy Act is in line with his company’s advocacy, he would not draw blood with a royal decree to promote domestic coal consumption, which contradicts the policies to combat climate change.
In his opinion, there is a clear, long-term gamble in this sense, despite the "sure" measures, as the Chairman of Iberdrola calls them.
As such, Galan believes that long-term investment decisions should start when it has already taken a long time to think through them, and a stable remuneration framework is needed.
Ferrovial wins the 'handling' of Aer Lingus in ten airports
Ferrovial's airport ground services subsidiary, Swiss Swissport, is going to be the preferred partner for cargo services in ten European airports.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are among the most prominent.
The agreement, which has not transcended economic terms, will last for five years.
Moreover, Ferrovial, the autonomous government of Castile-La Mancha, and the University of Alcala de Henares signed a protocol of cooperation yesterday to create a Centre for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructure.
The alliance will include an investment of 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the centre's tasks will be to research energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona disputes its first highway in Australia with Hotchief and Bougues.
Acciona is struggling for its first highway concession in Australia, a market where it already operates as an energy and water company.
The construction involves a 1.7 billion Australian dollar tunnel (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French Bougues and German Hotchief are its rivals.
A 5-km tunnel in Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the closest chance for Accionato to settle in Australia as a construction and motorway company.
The city council wants to complete it by the end of 2014.
After going for the public-private partnership (the acronym PPP in English) to move the project forward, in a business plan under the tutelage of Ernst & Young, the administration has a final list of candidates to take over the work and exploit the toll.
The total investment is expected to be 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros) and three consortia, with a remarkable predominance of European construction firms, are competing in the final stage.
The group known as Transcity, is headed by Acciona, the only Spanish one in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is a major Australian construction company, while the second, based in Italy, is one of Europe's most important specialists in underground construction.
The Northern District consortium is fighting Acciona's team, with the presence of the UK's Laing O'Roke, Australia's Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The last and final consortium to make it through the selection process is called LBRJV, where Australia's Leighton (a subsidiary of Hochtief, owned by ACS), domestic Baulderstone (owned by Bilfinger Berger) and Razel, the Gallic firm specializing in civil construction, split the capital.
The Australian infrastructure market promises big jobs and privatization, but it carries clear start-up difficulties if it does not rely on hiring a local construction company.
It is one strategy that the above mentioned Hochtief and Bilfinger, along with Asian shareholders, have pursued, and one that remains unresolved for the Spanish giants in the industry.
ACS simply acquired a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
Millionaires’ assets
Acciona is going to bid on a geographical location of highest importance for the sector, which has already a strong presence in the sector from its energy provider and desalination business.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra Wind Farm (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the corporate groupresponsible for building and managing the desalination plant in Adelida with a budget of 700 million.
This is a strategy to consolidate these two areas and exploit synergy in construction and infrastructure operations.
The underground toll road, sponsored by the Brisbane Department of Infrastructure and the Northern Link, is a major effort to reduce traffic in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration sets the deadline for the decision in summer 2010 and for the work to start in December of next year.
The toll road would be open for traffic in the closing months of 2014, but the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel started to take shape in 2005.
It will include two lanes in each direction, an electric toll system and sophisticated ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million dollars (308 million euros) for funding.

Australia continues to provide remarkable commodities to Hochtief, which announced its receipt of a Government contract worth 154 million yesterday.
The firm, owned in part by ACS, will set up the national broadband infrastructure with fiber optic cables through its local subsidiary, Leighton.
This will provide high speed internet access to 400,000 people and provide work for the German firm for 18 months.
The company has also transferred the project to build the 27-story high King George Tower in Brisbane. The work is yet to start, and Hochtief has closed the sale for 129 million.

By doing this, Alpine is strengthening its expertise in tunnel construction.
The construction is planned to start in the beginning of 2010, and the project timeframe will be 32 months.
Sra Rushmore is awarded Renfe's advertising award
Renfe has appropriated about three million euros annually for the advertising and marketing services of the Sra. Rushmore Agency for the next two years, the railway operator reported.

France Telecom fined 63 million for blocking competitors
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of 63 million euros on France Telecom for anti-competitive behavior in the country's Caribbean regions.
According to the Institution, the operator restricted landline and mobile phone competition by signing exclusive agreements, service plans, and loyalty programs with consumers outside of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and state-owned company has collected more than 560 million euros in fines since hindering its competitors in 1994.
The penalty imposed yesterday has been increased because the authority that oversees the competition believes France Telecom has committed similar violations in past and therefore is a repeat offender.
Application shop
The mobile subsidiary of the French company has followed the footsteps of other operators and has opened an on-line application shop with the aim of increasing revenue outside of telecommunications.
Orange Application Shop will be activated in France and UK.
It will not reach other countries, including Spain, until 2010.
Champions League has yielded 476.4 million to Madrid and Barcelona since it was first established in 1994.
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it started in 1992.
Then, Real Madrid and Barcelona have collected 476.4 million, making them the third and fifth clubs to have collected the most money in the competition.
The head of the list is Manchester United.
The head of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not only a means of earning glory. It is also a major source of income for the big clubs.
The UEFA figures show that the competition has provided 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them from Spain) who have participated in the event since the tournament was founded in 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have played well in this distribution.
The white club has been the third on the continent to have more money from participating, and the only one, after AC Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan team, the defending champion and last winner of the defunct European Cup in 1992, is fifth in the ranking.
The top two are Manchester United and Bayern Much, two teams that have also made more money by participating in the Champions League.
The two players have both lost against Barcelona.
The third country to have made more money through the Champions League is Spain, compared to Italy's four, England's three and Germany's two.
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated payment system UEFA uses.
This fiscal year the body chaired by Michel Platini expects to collect 1.090 billion for the Champions League.
The UEFA dedicates 413.1 million of that money to fixed rates: each of the 20 clubs participating in the prequalifying round (including Atletico Madrid) receives 2.1 million.
Additionally, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million for being there, and another 550,000 euros for every game they play.
The winners receive 800,000 euros and the eight quarterfinalists receive 3.3 million.
The last four will get 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, against the 5.2 million for the second place.
The idea of fixed rates is that a club takes home at least 7.1 million and at most 31.2 million.
Barcelona also received 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
Other varying payments to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed proportionately to the value of each television market.
Spain is the leader with four places allocated.
The winner got 40% of the allocated money, 30% for second place, 20% for third, 10% for fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of games played this year.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of the Sos
Yesterday, the Nueva Rumasa holding company reviewed the details of the bid on shares that led to the acquisition of a stake of between 25% and 29.9% in Sos.
It is a percentage that does not require them to launch a takeover bid (OPA) for all the securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa is offering 1.5025 euros per share, to be distributed over 10 years, and with a 1% annual interest rate.
shares closed yesterday at 1.85 euros, so Nueva Rumasa's offer undervalued the company 18% below its market value.
According to New Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is subject to the decision of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerezano group is giving a period of 15 days for shareholders to express their interest in selling shares.
The CNMV assure that it was not informed of the offer, despite Ruiz Mateos' company having contacted a regulator.
If this is successful, the payout would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is at 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos is restructuring its management.
In order to stay out of possible takeover bids and legal matters of its former managers, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, it announced the election of Maria Luisa Jordana as the Director of the internal audit.
It is a decision that makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food company.
This is a newly created position which reports directly to the group president.
The company is still in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of over 230 million from Sos to the Salazar Brothers' holding company.
In fact, it is possible that Sos will reveal further diversion of funds in the next few months.
In regard to the Salazars' credit, the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernandez Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) testified and affirmed that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing where the money was going.
CNMV authorised the exclusion take-over bid submitted by Inversora Mer.
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) approved the exclusion takeover bid of Federico Paternina by Inversora Mer, which was presented last October 9.
The supervisory agency explained that this operation is authorised after it is understood that its terms adjust to existing standards and that the information packet's contents, submitted after the amendments introduced last December 2nd, are considered sufficient.
The CNMV has stated that the offer includes the purchase of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at 7.65 euros a share, representing 8.95% of its share capital, which is traded on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
It also explained that it has kept 5,592,778 million shares, which will not be traded in any way until the completion of the offer, which specified the price determined by Frederico Paternina in accordance with current regulations.
New tools for inspection of cars
In these days of floods and accidents, garages are not only making profits.
Every day, thousands of cars that have been in accidents are towed to a garage, where a technician must assess the damage and what the repair will cost.
No claim is the same, and calculating the cost of parts and labor can be a long and complicated task.
Manually calculating the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor, may take two or three hours.
However, with the help of the most recent computer tools, it would take a few minutes.
This is why almost 100% of technicians are using this system.
Providers of services, claims solutions, and maintenance are working to collect data supplied by manufacturers, and then process it and offer it to customers as a tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of North American Solera Group, is the industry leader;80% of assessments are done using their products.
Other businesses in the sector, competing in data assessment and processing are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data supplied by manufacturers is far from easy.
According to Eduardo Velazquez, the Audatex business manager, 63 manufacturers and importers are working in Spain, and each one sends data in different formats.
The data to process is increasing to the point where they have released more versions, variants and engines in the last five years than in the previous 15.
When a new car hits the market, these companies get to work.
It is very difficult work because you have to catalog every thousand of vehicle parts and enter in your price.
In addition, a "smart" graphic is made for each model, where you can click on different parts of the car.
If it is a mass-market model, the work can be ready in a week, if the process is quick.
If it is an uncommon car, it can take up to three or four months.
The most exclusive models are Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
As for the number of cars in circulation, it is over 99%.
In order to document and develop the databases, Audatex has eight centres spread worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which specializes in a specific brand.
It has its national headquarters in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, over a hundred technicians (usually expert mechanics) work with three computer screens at the same time.
Audatex invests 90 million euros a year in developing these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million pieces of information are added, and clients receive updates every two days.
Developing that huge flow of information gives them different applications and different products.
The most common use is maintenance and repair, but depending on the country, there are tools to manage scrap pieces and to calculate the market and residual value of a car.
The only company with used car guide available in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer one in our country, but it does in the USA.
The products that Audatex offers, it is easy to get an idea of the kind of support available to professionals in this sector.
The company offers 10 different tools, AudaPlus being the flagship product, is the standard solution for technical assessment.
It includes cars, motorcycles, and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
Beyond the cost of parts, it also includes manufacturer estimates of repair times and paint charts.
This tool charges according to the use, for each appraisal.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros for customers who rarely use it, 10 times a month at most.
Then every insurance company that makes thousands of assessments negotiates their price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN, allow complete identification of a vehicle and the equipment it left the assembly line with, simply from its vehicle identification number.
AudaGlass focuses on the glass parts of a car, and AudaSubastas is an on-line service for the professional sector that facilitates the bid on vehicles being written off.
Their statistics service is very helpful for identifying trends, geo-demographic analysis and knowing standard deviations of makes and models.
Examples of such models are models that have gone to a shop for damage or how many have been in serious accidents in a particular period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company working on such tools.
It sells, among others, the GT Estimate, which is again designed for technicians and provides digital images, access to parts and the official manufacturer's official prices and times.
GT Motive is a Grupo EINSA company, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of automotive services and solutions for assessing damage, malfunctions and maintenance.
The GT Appraisal Guide is its historical reference product on the market.
The team works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 technicians and 53 insurance companies.
It has grown by 20% per year over the past three years, and it took in 10.8 million euros in 2008.
Early last year, the globalization process started with the installation of an office in Paris.
Meanwhile, Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and opened shop in Spain in 1979.
According to company sources, 62% of its business is produced in Europe and the rest of the world, and the rest of the 37% is produced in North and South America.
Grupo Solera's (Audatex, Sidex, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) global turnover will total 557 million dollars, 3.3% more than 2008.
In our country, the company took in 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, Solera was valued at 1 billion dollars on the stock exchange, and its shares are now listed for a total of 2.4 billion dollars.
It has been listed on the NYSE since 2007 and is included in the Standard &Poor's reference index.
damaged car on line auctions
October, Solera acquired Autoonline, a website for selling cars, motorcycles, and especially damaged vehicles.
The initiative involves an outlay of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company's capital, which would increase in the coming year by the remaining 15%.
The aim of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the potential of reaching an immense international market.
This appraisal and buying and selling service is exclusively aimed at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, technicians, rent agencies, shops, scrap yard, and professional sellers who must register before using it.
This platform was created in Germany in 1996, and it manages more than 650,000 transactions throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
It is mainly based in Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The site currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 technicians.
It oversees 3,000 listings a day, and around 100 new listings are added every day on the Spanish market.
In Spain, a vehicle with no registration number cannot be registered but can be used for undamaged spare parts.
Historic cars can be registered, even though they have been unregistered, after a long registration process.
A shop's estimate in four steps
With AudaTaller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user gets an estimate in only 4 steps: identify the vehicle, look for the spare part, create an estimate and generate an estimate.
User friendliness is essential for these systems, especially to convincing older technicians, who, to varying degrees, are more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are cars, 109 sport-utility vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, a computer with an internet connection is needed to use it.
After identifying the model to be repaired by its vehicle identification number, an effective graphic image of the model is displayed, and then the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the cost of labor, surcharges and discounts, and then print the estimate for the client.
AudaTaller is not an appraisal tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference is that the system aimed at garages does not include labor time estimates.
The cost of using this tool in a shop is 350 euros a year, which the customer can finance.
Presently, Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation mechanics are approving of, as you can select a door and turn it around to see the inside.
