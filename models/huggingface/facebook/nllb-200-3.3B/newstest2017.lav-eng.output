28-year-old male passenger found dead in a San Francisco department store
A 28-year-old painter who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a department store stairwell this week.
But the victim's brother says that he cannot think of anyone who would want to harm his brother, pointing out that "her life has finally started to improve".
The body found Wednesday at a Westfield supermarket has been identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia, a resident of San Francisco, according to a representative of the San Francisco medical examiner's office.
The San Francisco Police Department announced that his death was ruled a homicide and that an investigation is underway.
Upra's brother Luis Galicia told San Francisco broadcaster ABC KGO that Frank had previously worked as a waiter in Boston, but six months ago he landed his dream job at Sons & Daughters San Francisco.
A representative from Sons & Daughters said they were shocked and saddened to hear of his death.
"We are a small team working as a close-knit family, and we will miss him very much", said the spokesman.
In this difficult time, we think we're with Frank's friends and family.
Luis Galicia says that Frank used to stay in hostels, but recently things have been getting better.
"He moved into a new apartment and met a girl", Luis told KGO radio.
Luis Galicia claims he doesn't know who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man with a big heart.
"He always entertained his family by cooking a delicious meal and preparing lunch", said Luis Galicia
He never wanted to get into a fight.
He was the brother who adapted to the others.
"In the face of all the world's misery", he says, "he was like a diamond in the rough, sparkling every day".

New doctors strike: calls for new protests
The new doctors are asking their union to start protests over the new contract.
The Young Doctors' Committee (YDC) of the British Medical Association (MMA) is set to ask the council to back a wider protest in early September.
JAK considers that the Ministers have not succeeded in dispelling the doubts about the contract.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by the LMA.
The agreement was voted against by 58% of all members who took part in the vote.
In a tweet posted late on Thursday, JAK council member Eleni McCourt said the government continues to remain silent on the issue and therefore the deal offer has been rejected.
She said: "In view of this, the JAK vote has resulted in the contract offer being rejected in full and a decision has been made to request new formal negotiations to discuss more important issues".
In response to the government's silence, JAK today formally requested a meeting with the LMA board to authorize the drafting of new contracts to take effect in September.
The dispute has led to six strikes by young doctors, including the first work stoppage in the history of the NHS.
Following a vote rejecting the terms of the contract offered by the LMA, which had been recommended by the BMA, the new medical representative of the LMA, Dr Johans Malawana, resigned.
Before meeting with 54,000 new doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and would be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced that the contract would be awarded to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: A Forgotten Alliance?
The gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to agree to an eight-month-long truce and end the economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish leader at the St Petersburg palace, the impression was created that these partnerships were more needed by Ankara.
But they both got confused.
Vladimir Putin's smile seemed to be compressed and did not evoke warm emotions, even given his usual restraint.
In contrast, President Tayyip Erdogan referred to Putin as his "dear friend" at least five times, according to a briefing.
I'm out of numbers.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only be improved to the level of the past, but would become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan was acting as if nothing had happened.
I think his enthusiasm is causing some mixed emotions.
But Putin's radiant appearance shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the Russian plane crash on the Syrian border.
Moscow reacted strongly this time.
Putin accused Ankara of planting a flag in the back of Moscow.
The assault was even more painful, considering that it came from a friend.
True loyalty can be very difficult, if not impossible, to rebuild.
Since November, the public's attitude towards Russia has changed.
For months, state-controlled television broadcast aggressive insults against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed like it was all the Turks.
Most serious were allegations that Erdogan's own family had profited from the illegal oil trade in the part of Syria controlled by the Islamic State.
He himself, of course, denied that.
But the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that it's time to put the past behind us.
In the end, this meeting only happened because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could see this as some kind of victory.
Anaskar's benefit from the peace agreement is clear.
First, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after last month's failed coup attempt to overthrow him.
He has also been shaken by the number of terrorist attacks.
There are also economic motives.
The Russian sanctions have caused substantial damage, in particular the ban on charter flights, which normally provides for the influx of several million Russian tourists to Turkish ports each year.
The number of tourists dropped by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies will also be relieved when scheduled flights are resumed.
They hope to have a holiday in the Mediterranean at the end of the season.
State TV is already predicting a fall in fruit and vegetable prices this week as Turkish fruit and vegetable imports resume.
As quoted by the local newspaper Vedemosti, "Trusts for them, tomatoes for us".
But there were other political motives on Moscow's part.
Ankara is angry with the West for what they believe is a provocative reaction to the coup attempt.
To add to the confusion, there is dissatisfaction with the protracted EU accession negotiations and the meddling of Putin, who is taking advantage of Turkey's estrangement from the West.
The Russian leader has undoubtedly gained additional points in Ankara's eyes by voicing support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well, as it has deeply rooted fears of regime change in the country.
The summit, held in this splendid seaside palace, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present what one analyst called a "silent alliance", a two-nation alliance that felt alienated from the West.
Despite the public unity, however, there are still significant differences between the two countries.
The main disagreements are in Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peaceful non-state, but in fact Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
After more than three hours of initial talks, both presidents, reluctant to disclose information, announced at a press conference that they had not discussed the matter.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided questions about the differences between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on how the two countries can find common ground on the Syrian issue.
But after months of open hostility and potential disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian warplane, the situation has improved as the two leaders have at least resumed talks.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
SKB will continue to play a supporting role, the bank's managing director has announced.
The SKB will no longer be available outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan tells the BBC in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the bank's ambitions on a global scale.
It has given up these ambitions because eight years ago the bank almost went bankrupt and was in need of financial assistance.
In the meantime, experts in branding strategies have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, starting with Six Nations rugby and ending with Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
However, it is now decided to highlight other national symbols.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available to customers in Scotland, but it will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all SKB references outside the head office and official stock exchange listing will be renamed NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Now smaller private financial brands, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank, will also be in the spotlight.
McEwan was interviewed during the tour with clients and staff around Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "SKB will become our brand for investors and our employees to work with, because we are now becoming more of a brand bank".
In time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say we no longer have global ambition, we have local ambition.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in its sector and our staff will work with clients under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will no longer sponsor Six Nations and will engage in sponsorship of various sports brands.
"Is it time to become a brand bank, as we have long asked ourselves how to become a better bank for our customers?" says the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical to say that we would be a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
But through hard work and focusing on our customers' needs rather than our own, we have made a big difference.
We can bring these signs back to life, so I think now is the time.
Frankie Detori scored his 3,000th victory by taking first place at Newmarket on his horse Predilection.
Detori is crowned champion, winning his 3,000th victory by finishing second in the first race at Newmarket.
Friday night jockey Frankie Dettori claimed his 3,000th victory in British history by taking first place in the New York City Marathon.
He achieved this by winning the second race of the season in his home town, against Predilection, coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in a horse sprint.
He has joined Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pete Eddy and William Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Detori, who had previously won with his horse Ghayyar, said: "It's something special".
I'm very excited to have my family here.
I'm very happy that it happened in Newmarket, because I've lived here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not Royal Ascot, this is just a normal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I was relieved and very grateful.
After the victory, Detori and Predilection are greeted with applause and cheers.
Two jockeys have achieved this record in the obstacle course - champion Richard Johnson and the 20-time career champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who has set several records in his career, winning more than 4300 victories.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner, has 4,493 career wins.
Frankie is one of the best jockeys in the world today, and it's no surprise that he has achieved a level of success that few others have.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactics make him feel different from other jockeys.
He's a fantastic competition official, and his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans of the sport for years.
A few weeks ago at the Epsom Derby, I told Frankie he'd have won 6,000 races if he hadn't been in the weekend and the big races.
But seriously, it's a real pleasure to see that Frankie has been winning races in the UK for 30 years.
He's a man of great cheer, a great asset to the British racing establishment, and a great jockey.
Frank Dettori celebrated this achievement with his trademark flying squirrel.
From wind speed to flying speed, Frankie Detour has been the face of British horse racing for 20 years.
It's been an adventurous journey.
He has won countless major races, including the famous 1996 "Big Seven" in Ascota, and survived a plane crash and a disqualification for drug use.
Three years ago, he had a tough time coming back from a six-month suspension, but he showed his strength of character, challenging those who doubted him, and coming back in his best form.
And he could compete for some time - Detori has previously stated that he would like to continue competing until at least age 50.
Russian President Putin dismissed the head of the administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has abruptly dismissed the head of the administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been in Putin's inner circle for years.
Now the 63-year-old politician has been appointed as the special representative for nature and transport.
The Kremlin statement said that Putin "has decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as Head of the Presidential Administration of Russia", without stating a reason.
He was appointed by the Security Council as Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation.
44-year-old Vaino is a seasoned diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
According to the Kremlin website (in Russian), he later headed the Presidential Protocol and Government Staff Administration.
After taking office, he told Putin: "Thank you for your trust".
I believe the primary function of the administration is to support your work as president of the country, drafting laws and overseeing the implementation of your decisions.
Putin told the Russian Broadcasting Union on Friday that Ivanov had decided to resign and recommended Vaino as his replacement.
Is a smile convincing?
This step has shaken Moscow.
He is a close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, once worked for the Soviet Security Service (SSS) in the GDR.
In this capacity, he was one of the most powerful men in Russia.
In a televised meeting, both men announced that Ivanov was resigning on his own initiative.
But despite the smiles on camera, few people are convinced by such an explanation, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a power struggle?
No one knows.
But the official claim that the man who was considered a potential president suddenly wanted to become the leader of Russia's environmental policy is met with skepticism.
In comments published on the Kremlin website, Ivanov told Putin: "It is a fact that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this difficult, one could even say problematic, post for four years.
Turns out I've been in this job for four years and eight months.
He was appointed by the Government of the Russian Federation on 1 January 2011.
He was previously Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Security Council of Russia and a former member of the State Security Service of the DPRK, as is Putin.
In the late 1990s, Putin headed the Federal Security Service, the successor to the KGB, and Ivanov took over as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusts the most.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the post of President of Russia, as Putin's re-election for a third term would be unconstitutional.
But then another close associate of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, became president.
Putin became prime minister, and after three and a half years, he returned to the presidency.
A fish suddenly appears in a garden in Banff
A man from Banff asks for help in determining the circumstances under which species of fish appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bean thinks that the 75 fish could be sand flies that have been traveling through the water.
Mr. Beina, who lives about a half mile from the sea, posted a video of the fish on the website Periscope, hoping that someone might know how these two-and-a-half-inch fish ended up in his garden.
The cross of the Quin sphere: the bridge is now connected to the Faifi.
The current £1.35 billion project is scheduled for completion in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern part of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to the Faifu.
The first of the four connecting sections has been completed, meaning that the construction of the bridge is nearing completion.
The structure of the Faifa bridge is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel, 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 support cables.
The current £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Keith Brown, the Treasury Secretary, had arrived at the construction site today and was one of the first to step onto the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Bridge".
And what we see in this project is an unprecedented engineering solution, where just this part of the construction has used over 30,000 tons of cement and steel.
Despite its enormous weight and size, the bridge and the viaduct are extremely delicate and require a tremendous degree of precision.
Overall, more than 79% of the bridge deck is already built and the final stage connecting the bridge to Rosita will be installed today, meaning that all the bridge parts are ready to be installed.
Michael Martins, project manager of the Fourth Link, says: "The first link is a very important point in any bridge construction".
In this fantastic project, the first link demonstrates the highest level of engineering.
After installing the last section of the road and connecting it with the support of the north tower, we were left to connect the northern section of the road to the land part, or viaduct.
This was done by moving the northern approach road 700 millimetres south.
It was a huge operation, but it was also very delicate.
The pipeline is 222 meters long, weighs some 6,000 tons, and required a slope drag of about 3 percent.
Tender, because the tolerance in both directions the team was working with was only a few millimeters.
Thankfully, it all worked out.
Simone Biles wins gold in the women's gymnastics.
Forget the tension.
Forget the coat.
Simon Bales is not interested in this.
Dynamically leap.
He performs his exercises on the dance floor effortlessly.
Unpredictable on the floor.
Totally flawless.
And finally, an Olympic champion.
On Thursday, a 19-year-old American figure skater won a gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between herself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total of 62,198 points was a head-to-head victory over silver medalist and team-mate Alija Raisman and bronze medalist Russian athlete Aliya Mustafina.
Four-time U.S. athlete Simona Bails competed in the women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bailsa became the fourth American in a row to win multiple titles and the fifth best skater, gradually cementing her reputation as the best skater of her generation and perhaps the best skater in history.
When the final result was announced, she burst into tears, for her long journey to this moment was over.
This achievement puts him alongside unbeatable athletes like Michael Phelps, who took his sport to another level.
Bails has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at the world championships, including 10 gold medals, in combinations of such exquisite, precise and ambitious exercises that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retone called her "the best gymnast she had ever seen".
In Brazil, she faced a final test, where she had to compete largely with the expectations placed on her, not the other athletes.
He'd be disappointed to go back to his home in Spring, Texas, without the gold medals.
U.S. athletes Simone Biles (left) and Alija Raismane look on with glee after winning gold and silver medals respectively in the women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bailsa won her first gold medal on Tuesday, giving a special send-off party to the team's coordinator, Martha Karolyi.
Although Bailsa claims that she never expected anything like this on her long journey to the pinnacle of fame, it's not true.
Part of her performance, which includes her special acrobatic passing, is accompanied by Latin music that would be a great fit for the street next to the Olympic Games in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl who was adopted by her grandparents when she was a baby and who was discovered by coach Amy Burman's mother on a field trip to the Burman Gym has now become a force to be reckoned with.
She hasn't lost a multi-race match since the summer of 2013, and that winning streak can go on as long as Bailsa wants it to.
Although Mustafa made a slight leap in the lead in two rounds, it was an illusion.
The balance beam and free-ride portion of the competition, where Bails will defend her title, is just ahead.
She led the field with 15,433 and tied for the lead with 15,933 free throws.
Raismane looked at them kindly while they waited for the results, which were only a formality, and she burst into tears of joy at the fulfillment of a dream she had once noted in her notebook.
Raisman's result was a small revenge for an event four years earlier when she shared third place with Mustafin, but lost the bronze medal match.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, known to the Americans as "Grandma", led the way.
After a performance in free movement that cast doubt on her return, she could devote her air kisses to the effort.
Meanwhile, 19-year-old Bails' viral Twitter post this week has taken on a whole new meaning.
Six-year-old Mahy Brown, the "Lotter of the Lot", survives a shooting in Philadelphia.
Police say a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, making him the second 6-year-old to be shot in Philadelphia this week.
The parents of the child confirmed to CBS News in Philadelphia that it was Mahay Brown.
Parents say Brown was shot several times, including in the thigh, leg, arm and stomach, but was still conscious when taken to the hospital.
Her grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the TV station: "Her little body was just a lot of sackram".
I can't believe this.
The boy is in critical condition and has already undergone several operations.
The family says he'll definitely recover.
He had to start in the first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown is one of four people shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Three men were also shot: two men aged 29 and one man aged 32.
CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, while the other two victims are stable.
The channel reports that the child was found in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old victim in critical condition.
The other two victims were not found in the car, and police are investigating whether any of them was the assailant.
The investigator told CBS Philadelphia that multiple shooters were most likely involved in the shooting.
The gun casings from various weapons were found at the scene.
Looks like it was a prolonged gunfight.
The two sides of the pedestrian walkway were found covered with boxes.
"It also appears that there were several gunmen who were actively involved in the shooting", says Philadelphia police captain Anthony Ginaldi.
Several homes and vehicles were also damaged.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance footage.
In the second shooting, a frozen bullet hit a six-year-old girl in the hand as she played outside her house in the Vestoukleina district.
She's slowly recovering, but the police are still looking for the culprit.
What do we need Simone, Gabi and Laurie for?
I call it the Women's Olympic Rowing Team of the Year for a number of reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. team has never been this good.
Second, this team has three young women, Simone Bales, Gaby Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who are inspiring many young Indigenous women.
People can be proud that this team includes Aliya Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kociana, who is Catholic.
After all, this team truly represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Hispanic athletes in this sport.
The best gymnast in the last four years is an African-American woman.
Last year, Simone and Gabi came in first and second.
These are impressive results.
In previous Olympics, Gaby Douglas had been the surprise Olympic champion, and America was the lucky winner.
Now the world has seen the incredible feats of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unprecedented but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth consecutive American to win gold in the women's individual all-around.
Her team mate Aliya Raismane won the silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can do, but the rest of the country is a completely different story during exercise hours.
Simone, Gabi and Laurie made the Olympic team, as did Ali and Madison.
They are the "Olympic Five" because the next Olympic training team will only have four athletes, and this is Coach Martha Karol's last year as a coach.
In fact, exercise is an expensive sport, with athletes training mainly in private athletic clubs and their parents supporting them with training, facilities, travel, training clothes, accommodation (for coaches, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these athletic clubs are located in areas of most cities that can afford the sport.
These clubs are where athletes spend all their training, and it is an expensive and long-term investment for the families of the athletes.
Amy Burman, coach of Simonas Bailsa, and Maggie Haini, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have been coaching their girls since both girls began their careers in athletics.
We need to provide the young girls who inspire Simone, Gabi and Laurie with less expensive gymnastic training.
I started my athletic association 20 years ago.
My organization is based in Harlem, and we offer free or low-cost gymnastics training to more than 15,000 urban youths, mostly black and Hispanic, and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we're opening a branch in Detroit, my hometown, to give local youth a chance to experience this great sport.
The gymnastics exercises strength, locomotion, and coordination, as well as hard work, discipline, and focus.
This combination guarantees long life, good health, and success in school and in the workplace.
This team is inspiring thousands of young girls to train in athletics, and that's fantastic.
It's important to play this sport, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simon, Aliya, Gabi, and Madison, for your great demonstration of Girl Power, winning Olympic gold medals and inspiring countless young women from all backgrounds to become healthy, strong, and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's rejection of the offer, the new doctors are planning more strikes.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to a change in the contract with representatives of the British Medical Association, but this was rejected by 58% of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hunt announced plans to sign a contract, stating that the NHS was in a precarious situation and that further delays would only harm staff and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new contract which will change the working conditions for night shifts and weekends to improve working conditions for non-standard hours.
Last night, the new BMA medical officer, Dr. Ellen Makourt, said that the new doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it will deepen the labor crisis and that it does not provide equal conditions for all doctors.
We have eight weeks until the first batch of new doctors sign their new contracts, so we need to make progress because there's not much time left.
The BMA's efforts to resolve the problem through negotiations have been met with governmental non-intervention and sometimes complete silence.
This is despite the fact that just last month, Jeremy Hunt said that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt needs to act fast, end his unemployment, and work with the new doctors.
If he doesn't, the new doctors are ready for another protest.
During the last strike in late April, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed as nurses and consultants tried to replace doctors who had taken to the streets.
The ministers hoped to resolve the dispute by agreeing to change the contract with the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to increase the rate for weekend work for the 54,000 new doctors covered by the new contracts.
The NHS's chief executive of employment, Daniels Mortimer, has called on new doctors not to strike.
Mr. Mortimer explains that strikes do not solve anything, but only increase the pressure on the employees who are employed and cause anxiety, stress and delays for patients, carers and their families.
Over the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Young Doctors and together with the Ministry of Health and other agencies, we have responded positively to their questions about caregivers and informants.
Employers expect active cooperation on other important issues such as staff placement, flexible training, additional training for those returning from a career break, the cost of training, mutual recognition of training programmes, drop-out and gender pay gaps in medicine - shows that employers, the Health Education Authority in England and the Department of Health are serious about implementing the agreements reached with the BME in November, February and May.
A dose of 2 pounds a day may reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of heart attack patients could be treated with 2 pounds a day of medication, as the authorities recommend that more people take it for longer periods of time.
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of a second heart attack in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a second heart attack.
NICE, the NHS, recommends taking this medicine for 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of a heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
But now, under the NHS, NICE recommends taking it for four years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
About 140,000 people in England have a heart attack each year, and of these, a quarter have a second heart attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fats in the walls of the heart, creating blockages.
If the obstruction ruptures, it can form a clot, blocking blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
On the other hand, if the platelets break off from the wall of the blood vessel, they can travel further into the bloodstream and block the blood supply to the brain, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another heart attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by AstraZeneca in the United Kingdom and marketed as Brilique, reduces the risk of clots forming.
New NICE guidelines published today recommend that people take 90 mg Ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg twice a day for 3 years, together with aspirin.
Professor Carol Longson, director of health technology at NICE, explains: "Despite the availability of drugs to prevent a recurrence of a heart attack, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack or stroke will have another one, often with serious consequences".
Fear of repeated heart attacks can have a negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Ticagrelor has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of repeated heart attacks and heart attacks in people who have already had them, when used in combination with aspirin.
By provisionally offering treatment with Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to expand treatment options to thousands of people who are thus beneficiaries.
In view of the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding after more than three years of use, the draft guideline does not recommend that the medicine be used beyond this period.
The culture of political correctness is fueling election fraud in Muslim communities.
According to the management report, the former mayor of Tauerhamlet, Lutfurs Rahmans, was dismissed for corruption.
A government report reveals that a culture of political correctness is blinding wide-scale fraud in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Erich Pikul criticizes the police, the electoral commission and the city councils for ignoring signs of fraud in the elections because they are "afraid of hurting ethnic and religious interests".
A former community secretary who now heads an anti-corruption organization says that voter intimidation for religious reasons is so common that the police should be allowed to post guards at polling stations to protect intimidated voters.
He also recommends that voters should show their ID when they vote to prove their true identity.
Now, all you have to do is give your name and address.
He even suggests that the fingers of voters be marked with special ink to prevent double voting.
The Commission has also proposed that the EU should be involved in the development of the EU's nuclear programmes.
He believes that the press should be given greater access to Council documents and decisions adopted by the informal committees and working groups.
He says: "The goal is not just to prevent fraud by the will, but also to protect local government from the wider corruption and the culture of fraud that goes hand in hand with it".
The report was commissioned by Downing Street following the scandal surrounding the Tauerhamlet municipal election.
In a special election last year, the court decided to remove Lutfur Rahman from the mayor's office for corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically distorted" the religious views of his Muslim community and had silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman has been campaigning on the premise that it is the religious duty of a devout Muslim to vote for him".
About 300 votes were falsified or questionable because one person had voted multiple times.
Sir Eric also notes that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
He said that the fraud in postal voting, where senior members of the Muslim community have coerced others to vote for their preferred candidates, is particularly worrying.
Sir Eric recommended a number of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of identity documents to establish identity.
His report states: "Examples show that members of vulnerable ethnic minority communities, especially women and youth, are forced to vote for the community's senior elected candidates, especially in Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities".
"There is a fear that the surrounding institutions will not address these problems because of political correctness, because ethnic and religious interests could be compromised".
Sir Eric laid out 50 recommendations for improving the electoral system, including a ban on political activists working with votes delivered by post to prevent 'collection of votes'.
The report, which is being reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for more scrutiny of registration to prevent the use of voter rolls for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider requiring voters to present their identity documents before voting.
Marking the voting fingers of the voters with a special ink to prevent double voting.
Systematically check the citizenship of individuals to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Provide for a three-year limit on requests for automated voting by post.
Prohibit political campaigners and activists from working with postal ballots and ballot boxes for postal voting.
Provide the police with the power to provide security at polling stations.
Amend the law to facilitate the prosecution of individuals for intimidation under the Human Rights Act 1983.
Ban on taking photographs of the election in the precincts.
To require that only English is used in the elections (except in Wales).
Strengthen training for the staff of polling stations to ensure that voters go to the polls one by one.
Sir Eric is also critical of the Met Police, pointing out that it is incomprehensible that no charges have been filed in the Tauerhamlet case.
He said: "The election court only disqualified Luftur Rahman and his representatives for activities related to corruption and fraud".
He was convicted by the standard of proof in criminal law, based on irrefutable evidence.
He also criticizes the inefficient "due diligence" of the city council voters at the voter registration booths.
Sir Eric says: "The court ruling last year is a wake-up call.
Our country is known as the birthplace of parliament, but the alarming and hidden spread of election fraud and the institutional misrepresentation that fraud is not always a threat to that good reputation.
The Cyclist's Adventure - Keith's peers and other Rio Olympic celebrities' peers
The 2016 Rio Olympics fans were thrilled to see French cyclist Pauline Ferrand Prevot, who fans have identified as being remarkably similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old isn't the only athlete to be competing for gold this summer, with the media claiming his celebrity rival.
So in honour of the Rio Olympics and all the celebrities currently on our screens, FEMAIL has put together a list of Olympic athletes who are like Hollywood stars in every way.
The hunter and the wolf: U.S. archery team member Bradyj Ellison, left, compared with Leonardo DiCaprio from childhood
Aside from Keith's co-driver on the road, a lot of people online are suggesting that this gunfighter could be the twin brother of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, caused a storm on Twitter when photos were posted of him looking very similar to Wall Street Wolf.
The athlete himself noticed the storm on social media and admitted that he had been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
"I personally don't see much of a resemblance except for the beard", Brady tells Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I take it as a compliment".
This year, one of the most popular pairs of London 2012 Olympians is sure to gain even more popularity: the striking resemblance between British distance runner Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian lightweight Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, has been compared to Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
Speaking of swimming, for years now, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgs has been compared to "Born to Run" star Matthew Morrison.
Change: This user noticed that Nathan is a "sporty" version of the actor from the movie "Inception".
Also, the same age, tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similar hair and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yuliya Efimova and actress Annalin Makkorda can boast of more than sun-drenched skin and blond hair, but fans consider American athlete Nathan Adrian to be Joseph Gordon Levit.
In the background: Hoopa Solo, a soccer star (left), and Jennifer Carpenter, an actress on the TV series Dexter (right), have similar facial features and eyes.
None: one Twitter user was pleasantly surprised to find that others share these similarities
Theory: this user thinks there might be a reason why the two look so similar
Recently, one Twitter user was quite happy to announce that "general Internet users seem to agree that Huey Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look identical".
The American football star and the Dexter show actress really do have a similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medalist Gabby Douglas, who boasts a beautiful, broad smile that resembles that of Bring It On star Gabriella Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for commenting that Chinese swimmer 'finished like a pig'
Byron McDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhas' fourth-place finish in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay has sent a thunderclap through CBC's viewers.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators commented that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "fled the competition because she smelled" and "ended up like a pig".
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when the women's 4x200m freestyle relay finalist made his personal comments.
Macdonald, who was included in the CBC commentary team to give the commentary a life, said: "That little 14-year-old from China can't keep up".
"She was so excited, she ran out of the race, she stank and she ended up like a pig".
Thank you very much.
The second-place finish of Ai Yanhan, a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer, was 1:57.79, 1.61 seconds behind the Canadian Taylor Ruckas, allowing the Canadians to overtake China.
Viewers across Canada immediately reacted online, because they were shocked to hear such tones and expressions.
Emmett McFarlane tweeted: "Did a live commentator on CBC just say that a 14 year old swimmer from China 'finished like a pig'????".
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.
Ai Yanha of China in the women's 4x200m freestyle final was called "the under-age 14-year-old from China who doesn't follow".
The criticism of Byron McDonald was swiftly taken up as many demanded clarification.
Twitter users couldn't believe what they heard from Byron McDonald's unflattering comments.
A Twitter user named Sara Paradi wrote: "Ooh, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like racists. #contrary.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russell, who was then running the CBC live broadcast, apologised for McDonald's comments, saying: "We apologise that the comment about the swimming result was leaked live".
It was a poor choice of words, and we are very sorry that it happened.
CBC apologized to more than 90 people who had responded to the tweet.
McDonald's colleague Scott Russell had to apologize on his behalf.
The CBC then issued an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments.
The channel quickly issued an apology and a statement.
We deeply regret that these comments were made and that they were broadcast live.
Yesterday, we took immediate action and apologized to all our live viewers and social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were made about the swimmer's performance and not addressed to her personally.
But in any case, they were unprofessional and ill-chosen statements, and Byron was very sorry about what had happened.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald personally apologized on air and tried to explain that he did not think his comments would be taken as a personal attack.
Speaking on the CBC Olympic Games live, he said: "I would like to take this opportunity to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's freestyle competition".
I'm talking about the swimmer's performance, not the swimmer himself.
I can say that I did not mean to be disrespectful, and I am very sorry that this happened.
Primark shoppers are shocked by a woman who is unfaithfully walking through a lingerie store.
The shoppers were stunned when the woman began to undress to wear her panties in the middle of the store.
To make matters worse, she would put them on to make sure they fit and then remove them by putting them back in the shop window.
She continued shopping for clothes at the Folkestone Bouverie Place department store and added four more trousers.
Primark is a store in the Bouverie Place Mall in Folkeston, the place where this woman put on her underwear and then put it back in the bathtub.
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two, was also present. She said that the unknown woman had put on her clothes and left without buying anything.
She says that people could not believe their eyes.
Standing in the middle of the store, she took a pair of folded underwear, stripped off her sweatpants and pants, and measured them on the spot.
She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to put them, she just put them there.
Everyone watched her pull up her panties, and apparently she didn't like them, because she just kept them in her hair.
She tried on three more pairs of pants before deciding that she didn't like any of them and leaving the store.
She didn't seem to care that anyone would look or think about the person who would buy the clothes she liked.
Davidson, a 33-year-old woman from Kent, says: "It's scary to think that someone will buy clothes that someone else has worn and that have not been worn".
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson's bride adds: "I accept that the store staff removed the clothes from the store's shelves after she was seized - which is also acceptable".
I can't imagine buying a new pair of underwear and finding out that another woman has worn it and then it's not been wiped.
A representative of Primark stated that Primark was aware of the incident which occurred on Tuesday, August 9.
The clothes in question have been removed from the shop shelves.
How to protect yourself from gunfire using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com might make it a little safer.
To learn how to protect ourselves from gunmen at close range, we spoke with Krav Maga master Ron Mizrachi of New York.
Whether you're attacked from the front or the back, this video shows you how to protect yourself and gain the upper hand against an attacker.
Mizraki states that if an attacker is attacking from behind, then one must first turn to see the attacker clearly and avoid the trajectory of the shot.
Then the weapon should be placed between your forearm and shoulder and made to fit the opponent's face with your free elbow.
Then follow the circus on foot, and while the attacker is in pain, take his gun, go to his face with the butt of the gun, and back off, continuing to point the gun at him.
If an attacker approaches from the front, the situation is similar - you have to avoid the trajectory of the shooter, lock the weapon and lock it so that the villain cannot fire.
At the same time, you have to press the gun and you have to punch the opponent in the chest and finally you have to take the gun away from him and you have to back off and continue to aim at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video to see just how Mizraki does it.
But remember, if you're not a master of Krav Maga, it's safer to give the thief back your money.
The Vandals are demolishing the Saltache Cornwall social home and are being thrown out on the street.
The Vandals have been evicted from their home for terrorizing neighbors, causing £50,000 worth of damage to the social housing.
Tanja Skeldone and her partner, Sean Trebilcock, were evicted from their property in South Cornwall following a number of complaints against them.
When they were forced to leave the property, the housing officials were shocked to find that the property had been completely demolished.
There were holes in the walls and ceilings, and the walls were covered with graffiti and were covered with garbage.
The family is now evicted and is most likely living on private property.
Donna Makevoy, manager of the Cornwell Housing Authority, says there is concern that the housing could not be renovated.
She says that the people who lived here had a very difficult life, and she thinks that people cannot live like that.
In this case, several factors need to be considered, as the future reputation of this property in Cornwall will not be good.
This family is famous, and their name is well-known.
The other had three sons who were periodically on the property, and police say their terror took the form of violence, walking the streets with baseball bats, intimidating locals, drug use, drug dealing, and loud banging and crashing.
Skeldone, 47, whose name was on the property, was convicted in June of anti-social behaviour.
In the rooms of most of the demolished houses, debris was found.
A number of houses, where drugs were previously likely to be traded, have also been evacuated due to flooding.
Neighbors say they regularly took to the streets and called the police.
They were forcibly evicted by Cornwall Housing Authority after being given 11 weeks to voluntarily leave their home.
The desperate neighbors were very happy to be evicted, for their lives had been absolutely hell.
One said, "They didn't care about the other residents".
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and it's always been crazy.
You wouldn't believe how many times we've seen the police here.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet - we're used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be great here.
Adams Fitzpatrick, who is the head of neighbourhood protection for the Cornish Housing Service, said the family was not cooperating with local security.
The family lived here for 20 years and the police were called here regularly.
Various old and unusable items were found in the garden of the house.
He added: "It is a pity that the tenants have shown no responsibility for their behaviour, because eviction is always the last step in the Cornwall Housing Authority's consideration of evictions".
This was a very difficult case because his behavior was extreme and the neighbors had been very hard to dissuade from his behavior.
I appreciate the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and the community have done in this case, and they have been brave and cooperative in providing us with the information that we need.
I hope this event will make life easier for the neighbors and show that antisocial behavior is not acceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived here at different times, but all were about 20 years old.
A clean mattress that was left on the floor in one of the rooms after it was discarded.
The staff will now have to clean up the garbage heap left behind at the house.
In 2014, police raided the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, belongings and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldone was only convicted of possession of a class B narcotic with intent to distribute.
She claimed the money was for a memorial to her son, Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After the show, it was revealed that they were renting a private property in Plymouth.
Many houses had graffiti on their walls.
Police report they continue to evict tenants who violate their lease.
Devon and Cornwall Police Commissioner Angela Krova says the eviction is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
She added: "This is a warning to those who think that they can do as they please and that there will be no consequences".
Devon and Cornwall Police have no tolerance for criminal and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
A willingness to spend can give an economic boost.
Akropolis LT, which manages the Akropolis shopping and entertainment centres in Vienna, Klaipėda and Šauļi, will be merged with the Akropolis Group of companies, retaining all existing commitments to Akropolis LT's partners and employees.
The merger of Akropolis LT and Akropolis Group is expected to be implemented by 1 October this year.
We are entering a new development phase during which we will implement large-scale projects, therefore we are trying to simplify the structure of the company - this will allow Akropolis LT and the Akropolis Group to create a more efficient team of professionals.
We are currently implementing major Acropolis development projects within the decade - the construction of the multifunctional shopping centre Acropolis in Riga and the development of a multifunctional facility in Vilnius, on the former site of the Velga Plant.
'The structure of the new company will allow the experience and competence of the Akropolis LT team to be used more effectively to develop projects and take the necessary decisions in an operational manner,' acknowledges Sauli Zabulionytė, member of the board of Akropolis Group.
'Akropolis Group' is a group of companies managing real estate development, shopping centre rental and management companies in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Bulgaria.
The Commission has also received comments from the interested parties on the application of the contested decision.
The company will purchase a plate-cutting machine for EUR 89,500.
It was delivered by Lintera Riga.
For 33 thousand euros, the company will buy formatted stamps supplied by UAB Infleks.
So, Raco's going to buy a milling machine with a folding valve.
It was supplied by UAB Infleks for EUR 15,6000.
The cost of the hydraulic hot press, supplied by SIA Lintera Rīga, was EUR 32,6000.
The purchases are co-financed by the Rural Support Service.
Rauko was founded in 2007.
The company has implemented more than 250 different projects in Latvia, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
The mayor of Cannes has banned burkinis from the beach.
The mayor of the southern French resort town of Cannes has banned the wearing of burkini bathing suits, which almost completely cover a woman's body and resemble a hydrotherapy, on the city's beaches, officials said Thursday.
The mayor of Cannes, David Linard, has signed an order stating that "access to beaches and swimming is forbidden to anyone who does not wear a bathing suit that respects good manners and secularism" as a fundamental principle of the French Republic.
"Prostitutes who clearly display religious affiliation at a time when France and places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks may create a risk of public disorder (mudslinging, clashes, etc.) that needs to be prevented", the order said.
"We are not talking about a ban on wearing religious symbols on the beach, but about the casual dress associated with loyalty to the terrorist movements that are fighting against us", explained the head of municipal services, Thierry Migul.
He added that the burkini bathing suits had not been seen on the beaches of Cannes since 28 July, when Linare, a member of the right-wing centrist Republicans Party, signed the order and it came into force.
This week, a water park in the city of Marseille cancelled a planned private event for Muslim women who would have worn burkini swimsuits, amid a backlash from both right-wing and left-wing politicians.
In France, the wearing of the headscarf covering the face of Muslim women is prohibited, but religious symbols or appropriate clothing are not prohibited.
On July 14, 85 people were killed in a terrorist attack claimed by the Islamic State group in Nice, a resort city near Cannes.
On July 26, two assailants who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State brutally murdered priests in a church in northwestern France.
Jysk grew its sales by 5% last year.
The household retailer Jysk Linnen'n Furniture ("Jysk") increased its turnover by 5% last year, reaching EUR 23.66 million, according to Firmas.lv.
The company's turnover in 2014 was EUR 22,57 million.
The company's profit also increased slightly, from EUR 781 235 in 2014 to EUR 785 896 last year.
The management report states that last year the company reconstructed the existing store in Riga, on Slokas Street, and closed the store in Riga, on Kurzemes prospekt.
This year, as in previous years, the main task of the company is to continue to increase both turnover and profit.
In the meantime, it is recommended that the profits of the previous year be left unsplit.
Jysk is a global chain of shops offering home improvement products.
SIAJysk Linnen'n Furniture was founded in 2001.
The capital of the company is EUR 3 500 264.
The company is owned by a company registered in Iceland, Joska Eignarhaldsfelag ehf av PLC.

The Kuban Festival is starting in Lucasa.
On the evening of Thursday, 11 August, one of the last summer festivals was launched in Lucca, where the "Cuba" will be held until Sunday night.
The first night's lineup included the British band Enter Shikari, who were expected but disappeared from the program last year, the American punk band NOFX, DJ Maxim of The Prodigy, and others.
The following days of the festival will also feature notable names - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", punk rock legend "Ramones" bandleader Markijs Ramons with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg", "Brutto&Lyapis" with Belarusian punk leader Sergei Mihaloku in the lead, popular grunge singer and actor Vahtangs Kikabidze, Ukrainians "Vopli Vidoplyasova" and a number of others, but the full event program can be viewed here.
This is the second year that the Kubana festival is held in Latvia.
Despite the financial failure and huge losses, the organizers did not stop trying again - they added a landmark to the name, included a Latvian band in the program (on Friday evening at 19:15 on stage "All Day Long") and announced that the festival had now become "close and got the local colors similar to the symbols of Riga such as its panorama and cats".
Whether this effort is justified remains to be seen, for the festival is only getting better, but as Delfi Entertainment observed on the first night, at least for now, the huge crowd was not attracted and the number of visitors was the same as last year.
The British road cycling team has twice broken Olympic records and won the sprint.
The British track team on Thursday doubled its Olympic record and won the men's sprint.
The British set the first Olympic record in qualifying, but the New Zealanders broke it again in the first round of competition.
The British team faced New Zealand in the final, and the British took away the Olympic record holder's title from the New Zealanders, leaving them with the silver medals.
In the final, the British team won with a score of 42.440 seconds, beating the New Zealanders by 0.102 seconds.
In the bronze competition, the French team beat Australia.
It should be noted that the record was also broken in the qualifying round of the women's sprint, with the British team setting a new world record, which is now 4:13.260.
The president who stayed behind: Gustav Zemgalam, 145.
On Thursday, August 12, the second president of Latvia, Gustavs Zemgal, was born 145 years ago.
Zemgal proclaimed the Latvian state, but unmeritedly remained in the shadow of the widely described first Latvian president, John Cactace, and the last president of the pre-war period, Karl Ulman.
No other of our statesmen has been as strong a defender of democracy and the rule of law as Zemgal, the author of the book dedicated to Gustav Zemgal published ten years ago, Arnold Auzin.
In an interview with the Delfi portal, Auziņš points out that Zemgals is one of the few politicians in high office who had a sense of humor.
The rest of them are stiff, always very accurate.
He taught us not to be that way, and today it could be the same as Raymond Wyon.
"He was a man of the people", says the Witness.
Today's politicians have a poor understanding of history, they refer to Karl Ulman as a good leader, but few know how bad he was.
The only person he didn't yell at at in the cabinet was General Balodis.
Even if he's kind and smiling in the pictures, he was hysterical by nature.
"The country with its sense of humour and democratic character gives the opposite impression", says Auziņš.
Professor Aivars Stranga of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia agrees with Auzi's assessment of Zemgal as a peaceful and devoted statesman.
He also notes that Zemgals excels in respect for minorities, having regularly invited Jewish representatives to the presidential palace.
"It was not a common practice at the time, and after the Zemgala presidency, Albert Kwiecis took over the tradition", the historian says.
He was a quiet, determined man who had a long struggle to become president.
He didn't like it, he just didn't want the glory.
He was also very critical of himself because he didn't speak French, but he thought the president should definitely speak French.
"During the presidency, the French language was taught in its basic form", explains Strang.
He was not willing to be persuaded to run again, and he did not like the very idea of being elevated.
In any case, he is a very respected figure in the history of Latvia, even before entering the presidential palace he had a serious job - he was a very sought-after notary.
Zemgals also ran the famous Zemgala's office on Suvorova Street 3, where the Association of Carpenters and Sculptors was located, in which the Latvian state became a government negotiation.
He was always progressive.
He wasn't a big fan of Ulman, but he didn't like him publicly either.
"In private conversations, he has sometimes expressed disapproval of Ulman's actions", Strang says.
They lived peaceful lives, no suspicion of crime or corruption.
How is Zemgal remembered today?
Unfortunately, he's mostly associated with one street in Rio.
He was a staunch democrat, a centrist.
"There was no great upheaval during his time, that is, he could associate himself with a truly stable presidency", Strang summarises.
During the presidency of Gustav Zemgal, from 1927 to 1930, the Latvian state visit to Sweden also took place, which at that time indirectly meant full recognition for Latvia in the neighboring countries and inclusion in the family of democratic nations of Northern Europe.
On 28 May 1929, Zemgall arrived in Stockholm on a state visit.
The reply visit of King Gustav V of Sweden to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second president of Latvia was born in 1871, but died in January 1939.
Simple ways to help your child deal with tantrums
I often encounter the fact that a child's anger, a child's annoyance, is seen by parents as something wrong and abnormal.
When a child expresses anger openly, we do not know how to react, says psychologist Ekaterina Kes.
Specialist urges a little conversation about these very natural and human feelings of anger and resentment that everyone experiences periodically.
Aggression is a physical action directed against another person, and it usually occurs when we are angry.
When we adults are angry, when we're upset, we usually know what's happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can express, suppress, hide, or keep our anger and resentment in ourselves, we can tell our friends or other relatives about it, we can blow up the couch in anger, we can smoke cigarettes (not the best way to get rid of anger!), we can take a shower, we can shoot a gun at a fire, and we can do other things that we don't normally do.
We're not aggressive towards others because we know different ways of dealing with these emotions.
Children, when they're angry, don't know what's wrong with them, what to call them, how to live with them.
They may say, "Get out!" "You're a fool!" "You're a bad mother!" "I don't hurt you!" "I'm not going to hurt you!" - and very rarely, when they can say, "I'm mad at you!"
Children are literally alive, they are fully present, they are spontaneous and genuine in their feelings, and they are often in the grip of emotions.
It is vital that parents not forbid their children to express their feelings, including anger, but instead show respect and help.
Do you need a break in a relationship?
A long day at work, not having everything go your way, or just a bad mood - there are so many reasons why you might want to "get away" from the world for a while, a day, or even longer.
Can we take a moment to explore the relationship and take a breath?
Or does it mean that each partner will have his or her own way of life?
The opinions of men of different ages are shared.
John (23) is succinct and concise: "In my opinion, if a break is necessary in a relationship, then you are not with the real person".
Meanwhile, 30-year-old Edwards has discovered a pattern that may help someone.
If you feel your mate's irritation at every little detail, then surely it is the right time to search other hunting grounds to see if you miss him or if you do not particularly care for him or do not want to see him at all.
So the answer is, yes, taking a break can help you save time and realize how important your significant other is to you.
Caspar (29) reveals his theory.
I think in relationships, you have to take a break from each other every day, because if you're spending time with someone 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then conflict is inevitable.
It's caused by you noticing every little thing the other person is doing, and it starts to get on your nerves.
People become resentful of one another, especially when there is nothing to talk about except what you did that day.
My personal experience suggests that, and I've never had a relationship lasting more than a few months.
If you ever think that somewhere else or someone else is better, then why does this woman you're with deserve someone who can think that this is not good enough and there are fields of paradise beyond the mountains?
Thinking is a small betrayal.
If it's not, it's not.
"I have a job, so I'm a little judgmental of people who don't have one", says Edmunds, 46.
Carl, 33, has a completely different view.
I think we all need a little time to catch our breath.
You can't look each other in the eye every minute, all the time, from morning to night, and gloat over undying love.
You're going to drown!
There's so much going on. Friends, work, parties.
There's a time for everything.
Of course, a girlfriend or a wife, but if they can maintain that balance between family life and the outside world, then it can live on to the grave.
That's it.
Says a 27-year-old man named Martin: "It's hard to say whether you should or shouldn't take a break, but the fact is that there's something missing in the relationship that's causing it".
If this is the case, then they should expect that some change will soon take place - for better or for worse - depending on their own circumstances.
I mean, while you're young and crazy, you need to be taken for granted - maybe all the time, but when things get serious and the relationship enters a whole new phase, then there's no talk of rest.
You're supposed to spend the rest of your lives together!
"If you can't stand each other now and need a break every now and then, what will happen when you're retired and commenting on how the cats are crawling or arguing over which day is better to tend the garden", explains Kristaps (19).
All the names of the gentlemen have been changed.
With his charming and captivating personality, Rosenthal first aroused the Latvian people's interest in the performing arts.
Roman Suta wrote of Jani Rozentalu, a great master of Latvian painting: "In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian people, and as such he will be remembered forever".
In 2016, when the exhibition was opened in the main building of the National Art Museum of Latvia, it was clear that Rosenthal is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition opened on August 12, but it has been open to the public since August 13 and will remain open until October 30.
The Latvian National Museum of Art with a large retrospective in the newly opened Great Exhibition Hall of the work of painter Jani Rozentalu (1866-1916), whose 150th birthday is included in the UNESCO calendar of celebrations on an international scale.
The retrospective exhibition, which features more than 150 works, is one of the key events in the programme for the centenary of Jean Rosenthal.
The selection of works of art is mostly made up of the collection of the Latvian National Art Museum, which convincingly represents the main stages and genres of the classic creative activity, stylistic variations and the diversity of techniques.
In addition, exhibits from the Akseli Gallena-Kallelas Museum, the Museum of Art and Music, the Leipzig Museum, the Tukuma Museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland were used.
The presence of the photographs brings the atmosphere of the year to life, the exhibition's mobile app reveals the links between individual works of art and photographs taken by the artist himself with his camera for the purpose of innovation.
The Finnish-Latvian association Rosentāls-seura, named after the Latvian classic, is also offering the first edition of a small informative traveling exhibition "With a Sight in Finland, With a Heart in Latvia" at the Latvian National Museum of Art.
A similar exhibition with content in English, Finnish and Swedish will be opened in the autumn at the Virka Gallery in Helsinki.
Matt Leblanc is looking forward to returning to Top Gear.
The host of Top Gear, Mets Leblanc, said he was looking forward to the car show's return for a second season, but admitted he had no idea what lay ahead.
Nothing official yet.
"If it is, it will be on the BBC", Leblanc told television critics.
Doubts about the future of "Gazza in the Grid!" were raised in July when LeBlanc's rival Chris Evans announced he was leaving the show.
After leaving, Evans admitted that LeBlanc and Gas on the Floor! were "like made for each other".
Evans described the former Friends star as "a real, honest man", thus raising rumors that the two's friendship had faltered during filming.
When Leblanc was asked what he liked most about the show, he said that traveling to other countries, such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
The BBC has announced that the show's 24th season has no immediate plans to replace Evans.
Meldonium could be removed from the list of banned substances for athletes as soon as this year.
Meldonium, which is part of the medication Mildronat produced in Latvia, could be removed from the list of substances prohibited for athletes this year, academician Ivars Kalviņš, director of the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, said on the LNT broadcast 900 seconds on Friday morning.
He told me that he would go to Canada in September to discuss the drug problem with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
The scientist expressed the hope that Mildronate would be removed from the blacklist this year.
Two cyclists in Sigulda have been taken to hospital after a collision.
Two cyclists collided in Sigulda, Switzerland, with various injuries, the State Police said.
The victims were two males born in 1987 and 1990, both of whom were admitted to a medical facility.
A cyclist was also injured in the Koknes crash.
Born in 1905, he was admitted to the hospital in 1989.
In the Dobele district of the city of Naudite, a motorcyclist born in 1989 tries to avoid a dog that ran onto the road and crashes.
He's in the hospital, too.
On the night of the event, Latvia recorded 71 road accidents, in which 16 people were injured.
Some places will get colder.
The weather forecast for the region is expected to be slightly cooler than in the rest of Latvia, the Latvian Environmental, Geological and Meteorological Center (LETA) has learned.
We're looking at a possible ducking of the mermaid.
The forecast for the rains is mostly in the north of Kurzeme and Vidzeme.
The maximum air temperature will only be in the range of +16 to +19 degrees.
In Riga, the day will be sunny and without rain.
However, the air shall not be warmer than +18 degrees.
The backdrop of the American modeling business in his interpretation has acquired the perverse gloss of a thinned photosynthesis and the horror-film unlikability.
In essence, a very provocative work, balancing the subtlety and banality of vulgarity, in which it is difficult to draw the lines between European art house films and the territory of the Hollywood genre product.
The film, starring Vigo Mortensen, focuses on the question of whether the lifestyle models that parents have chosen (ecology, vegetarianism, alternative and a departure from the gluttony and values of consumer society) bring blessings or destruction to their children.
The father of six children, an idealist, is confronted with questions about the right choices and true values after the death of his wife.

Of course, the shark does this as an attack on the delicate swordsman who was a swimmer in the Jacobean era, and in this case, the daring surfer portrayed by Blake Lively.
The job required her profound heroism.
This survival rate can be compared to the exemplary acting skills of James Franco in 127 Hours and the performance of Ryan Reynolds in Breaking Bad.
Perhaps the main character, Mila Kunis, is also to blame for her transformation from model mother to creative survivor and almost family-oriented person, a fantasy of a Hollywood screenwriter who has disappeared.
The Islamic State has taken 2,000 civilians captive in Syria.
Fighters from the Islamic State terrorist group who fled Menbij in Syria's Aleppo province have taken some 2,000 civilians hostage and used them as living shields, the US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance and the monitors said on Friday.
"We did not shoot them because they took civilians with them when they fled to Djeroubulus", declared the spokesman for the Kurdish Menbij Military Council.
After two months of fighting, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance in northern Syria, announced on Friday that Manbij had been liberated from jihadists.
The Islamic State took Menbij in 2014.
The QSD had already eliminated most of the ISIS fighters from Manbij last week, but some remained and showed friendly resistance.
However, on Friday they left the city, taking the prisoners with them.
The Islamist is coming to Jerabulus, which is on the Turkish border.
The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) also reported that the Islamic State had kidnapped some 2,000 people.
SOHR reported that Islamists hijacked the cars of the residents, forced the people to gather in them, and then drove them to Djerraboulos.
Islamic State militants have also carried out mass abductions in the past.
In January, Islamist militants seized territory in Deir ez-Zor province in eastern Syria, abducting more than 400 civilians, including women and children.
The Islamists then released some 270 of the prisoners.
It is not known how many ISIS fighters have fled Menbij.
A spokesman for the Kurdish Menbij Military Council reported that the QSD had managed to rescue 2,500 people held by Islamists in Menbij.
The SOHR's information shows that at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, lost their lives in the battle for Menbij.
299 QSD fighters and 1019 jihadists were killed.
Koleghova has declined to stand for the post of head of the ODI.
The head of the State Environmental Service Inga Koleegova has decided to withdraw her candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), the agency LETA informed in the Ministry of Finance.
Koligova points out that the discussion of her candidacy has been marked by disagreements between the parties of the ruling coalition.
It seems that the real reasons for the debate are related to the visible, but more often invisible, interests of politicians and have nothing to do with my professional judgment.
'I can't even accept that,' says the former head of the EOD.
In the event of her candidacy being approved by the government, it was clear that it would not be a convincing vote and that it would not allow the full work and the necessary changes in the VUE to be carried out with the full support of the government.
Without it, the work would not be complete, concludes Koleegova.
"I have publicly stated on several occasions that I do not want to be politically dependent, but at the moment my entire candidacy process is overly politicized", explains the official.
"Thank you for your trust and support, it is an experience that I value as a benefit", writes Koleegova in her submission to Reizniece-Ozola.
On Wednesday, Unity pointed out that during the meeting with Koļegova, 'substantial contradictions' were revealed between the explanations of the candidate and the information available in the public registers on the dividend payments of SIA Pallog, as the publicly available decisions of the meetings of the Pallog members provide for non-sharing of profits.
The current head of the EES is the Deputy Director-General, Dace Pelēkas.
The police in Lviv were involved in the rescue of two children who had been left without supervision, according to the regional office of the State Police in Latgale.
The report of an unattended infant carriage arrived on Friday at approximately 7:00 a.m.
They were found in the building of a former store in Lviv.
Both little girls were immediately taken to the medical services.
A briefcase with papers and a cell phone were also left in the car.
In less than half an hour, the police officers had located the parents and were on their way.
When officers entered the civilian woman's home, they found her asleep after a heavy binge of alcohol.
According to preliminary information, the woman, born in 1992, had been drinking five drinks the night before.
After sitting down together, the woman decided to leave the children at the store under mysterious circumstances.
The police immediately informed the orphanage court, which would then decide the fate of the children.
Riga voluntarily submitted all the recommendations of the NCA regarding the project of the island of Kreta.
The Riga Port Authority has submitted all five recommendations of the State Control (VK) regarding the implementation of the project Infrastructure development in the island of Krievu for the transfer of port activities from the city center, the enterprise informed Diena.lv portal.
The Commission notes that the project is not part of the public service remit.
In order to implement the recommendations in line with the CC's wishes, the Riga Freeport Authority also followed the conclusions of the legal and operational audit carried out by the international auditor Deloitte Riga Freeport Authority and the recommendations made to improve the project management at the next stage of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations was also sent to the UK today.
Although the Riga Freeport Authority does not agree with the UK's opinion on the feasibility of the Krievu Island project, we are very responsible towards the implementation of the project and the funding provider, the European Commission (EC).
I would like to emphasise that all the construction works planned for the project have been fully completed within the deadlines and the planned scope.
"In order to demonstrate to all those involved in the project, including the EC, UK and also the stewards, that the main objective of the free space is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all the recommendations of the UK regarding the project management and monitoring", says Sanita Kaire, the project manager of the island of Krievu.
The long-term action plan for controlling and monitoring the achievement of the project objective was supplemented by the most important planned activities of the parties involved and the necessary decision deadlines, the definition of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, the instruments for monitoring the planned construction process, as well as the definition of the most significant threshold.
The approved action plan for the achievement of the project objective until 31 December 2018, in line with the recommendations of the VK, supplemented by the implementation monitoring activities, thus strengthening the timeliness control of the activities of the other parties involved in the implementation of the project by the Port of Riga.
A project management plan has been developed to improve the management of the project and reduce potential risks, defining the project management areas and indicating the documents developed to provide control and monitoring mechanisms for each of them.
A project management structure chart has been developed for the capacity building of the project, reflecting the structure of the project management team, the qualifications and functions of the staff.
In order to improve communication between the Riga Freeport Authority and the parties involved in the project, a communication plan for the project stakeholders has been developed, which, in addition to the parties set out in the project action plan, defines the principles, methods and periodicity of information exchange between the stakeholders for the successful completion of the project.
In order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, the need to conclude or initiate a service contract and the legality of the contract will have to be established in greater detail in future.
The project has built world-class port infrastructure on the island of Krysko - four new deep-sea berths, railway connections and engineering communications.
The Cohesion Fund-funded projects were completed and put into operation at the end of last year, saving EUR 10.6 million in financing.
In Slovakia, security has been increased at airports due to the threat.
Following the receipt of an unspecified threat, Slovakia on Friday increased security measures at several airports, the Ministry of the Interior announced.
"In view of the threats, we have increased security measures at the international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Košice", a spokesman for the Slovak Ministry of the Interior told AFP on Friday.
"The National Security and Analysis Center is currently analyzing the information we have received", he added.
The Slovak capital will host an informal European Union (EU) summit on 16 September, with the participation of all the bloc countries except Britain.
The summit will discuss the outcome of the UK's Brexit referendum and the future of the EU without the UK.
Slovakia holds the EU presidency until January.
German researchers are debating the number of victims of the "Berlin Wall".
A new study suggests that the number of people killed in the former Eastern Bloc under communist rule may be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the true number of victims remain.
According to figures released on Wednesday by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989, 1,841 people were killed by communist authorities on the border between the western allied zones and the newly formed West Germany for trying to escape from their controlled territory.
The museum has been tracking border-related deaths for years, and it's been updating the casualty figures every few minutes.
This year, 11 more deaths were added to the list, including the death of a six-year-old boy who drowned while trying to reach his family in the West Germany through what was then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are Soviet army deserters.
"The ultimate extent of the damage caused by the double evils of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented", admits the museum's director, Alexandra Hildebrante.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died trying to escape the Communist-controlled state are cleaned and preserved", emphasized Hildebrandt in a statement.
But other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The number 1841 is inconclusive", claimed Johannes Stathus, an expert in the history of Eastern Europe at the Free University of Berlin, in an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
He and other researchers from the Free University of Berlin are currently reviewing possible suspicious deaths at the border, and have so far managed to confirm only 260 cases.
Previously, researchers estimated that 138 people were executed by the Communists at the Berlin Wall alone.
The number of people who have died trying to escape across the Baltic Sea or to reach the West through neighboring countries, the State estimates, could be as high as a thousand.
But it's still significantly lower than 1841.
One reason for the different number of victims could be the different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also counts all suicides of Eastern Union border guards, whether or not they were directly related to their service.
The museum also records deaths that are not directly related to violence.
"If seniors in their 70s or 80s die of heart attacks after crossing the border", Hildebrante believes, this must be the effect of this "border of slaughter".
But the state is convinced that a distinction must be made between elderly people who may have died as a result of their experience and those who died as a result of waiting for a long time in the heat of the bus at the border.
Regardless of its victims, keeping track is not easy, since the Communist authorities in the Soviet Union did not keep such statistics, and researchers have to search for documents in various scattered archives, says Štát.
However, the State Department has recently been updating its files, and so it may soon come up with new estimates of the number of victims.
LPF president Pone is going to Rio with a coaching accreditation; it's a surprise to him.
Kaspars Pone, the president of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF), who has gained notoriety in recent days, arrived at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games with the accreditation of the coach, but he himself is surprised by it.
The third day of the controversy was triggered by the comments of Olympic swimmer Alona Ribakova's coach, German Jakubovska, who revealed that he had decided to go to Rio de Janeiro at the last minute, while the coach had to stay at home.
The initial list of riders included the confirmed swimmers Alona Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, the coaches Jakubovskis and Dave Collins, as well as the federation's president Pone.
The Latvian Swimming Federation had five participants for the Olympic Games, and even before the departure Aldons Vrubljevski claimed that Germans would be there and that he was being sought for tickets.
"However, apparently for objective reasons, he did not run", said Pone, expressing the view that this did not affect Ribakov's result.
At the request of the federation, Uvi's coach offered to help her.
Pone, who is himself a member of the IOC Executive Committee, has sharply criticized the IOC's actions, blaming the governing body for the Olympic sports.
It seems to me unethical to confirm five people to the Executive Committee of the LOC and not to appoint any of them.
"I don't know why the Swimming Federation didn't get a seat", Pone complained that the work of the federations and their presidents was not appreciated by the public, recalling that the federation presidents do not receive salaries.
Pone also criticized Jakubovski himself, pointing out that before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not confirmed as a participant, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and called on Latvia not to send any athlete.
But Mr. Pone couldn't explain why he was at the Olympics with a coaching credential that was probably due to Yakubovsky.
"I was signed up as a team leader, but for some reason I got my coaching credentials and now I'm not getting in".
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditations available changed.
I thought German would be there till the last minute because I had no other information.
According to the information available to the agency LETA, a couple of days before the start of Ribakova she had a face-to-face conversation with Poni and after her swimmer was with tears in her eyes, but the LPF president himself said that it was a casual conversation with the desire to motivate athletes before the start.
Pone recalled that the LPF oversees five sports in the Olympic programme, and four of them are also training children in Latvia.
The President of the Federation said that the issue of slaughter was also very important in Latvia and that he had spoken about such programmes when he was in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the federation and said that in 2018 Latvia could host the World Cup stage.
Being in Rio de Janeiro is not my vacation, it's where I work, spend my time and try to implement the four-year programmes.
600,000 salmon calves are being released into the Danube.
The fish stocks are being re-established this week in the Mangal Island, in the course of the Latvenergo AS fish resource recovery programme, and more than 600 000 one-year-old salmon and trout pups are to be released this year, from the Bior Tomes and Doles fish hatcheries of the scientific institute.
The Latvian energy agency LETA reported that the fish release will continue in the coming months - every year, a total of 6 300 000 juvenile fish and larvae of various species are released into the waters of the Danube basin.
In spring and early summer 2016, the lark and the black-legged cockerel will be released, in June the herring, in July the spring sole, and in August and September the perch and the wimps.
Latvenergo's Production Director, Mr. Maurice Kuňickis, said that concern for the environment is one of the cornerstones of Latvenergo's sustainable development.
'Each of the activities in the area of conservation and reproduction of animal resources is directed towards environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the Bior scientific institute, both through the rearing and introduction of juvenile fish into the Danube basin and through other activities,' Kuņickis said.
This year, more than 600,000 one-year-old salmon and trout cubs will be released into the Danube.
From the age of two, the young fish are marked by cutting off the fat.
The cargo delivered today contains 25 000 salmonids with an average weight of 31,3 grams.
Every year, the infant and young fish are released into the Danube and its basin in scientifically based species and in numbers.
The fisheries management in the Danube and its basin is carried out by the Bureau in accordance with the legislation, based on an expertise on the loss of fisheries resources caused by Latvenergo's economic activities and providing an opinion on the compensatory measures to be taken to ensure the diversity of fisheries resources.
The amount and form of compensation is decided by the State Environment Agency on the basis of this expertise.
The annual compensation amount for the fisheries recovery programme of Latvenergo is EUR 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016, Latvenergo, in collaboration with the charity "Mēs žuvim" (Fish Meat) for the fifth year, placed 400 artificial fish in a nesting area in Daugava near Kaibala and Ikšķiles.
Cooperation with the community to promote the natural spawning of fish is an additional initiative supported by Latvenergo under the Fish Resources Recovery Programme.
The placing of artificial nests in the reservoir is an important measure that contributes to the protection and enhancement of fish resources in the Danube.
The Sansusishi Concert Hall is a country garden, forest, and a circus.
Sleeping in a tent, eating in a restaurant, walking in the cages and listening to sophisticated chamber music, enjoying the peace of nature - this is the combination offered by the alternative chamber music festival Sansusi, which invites you to the Aknysta district for the third summer.
The festival will take place in the garden of the former kitchen of Susie, a village that no longer exists, next to the woods and the grass.
For three days, August 12 to 14, five stages will combine the exquisite delight of carefree nature and academic music.
The music is accompanied by theatre and contemporary circus, performances and installations.
Opera and academic music, especially in its more recent incarnations, find new audiences in a free and open environment without the constraints of a concert hall.
The distance from here to Riga is about 90 miles [150 km], but it's only a few minutes to a smile on your face and a light on your feet.
"Please do not miss the programme, because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance so that people do not go to one particular event or artist, because the real taste of Sanssui can only be discovered by spending all three days there", says the festival's initiator and host, operatic baritone Armands Siliņš.
The festival gates open Friday at 5:00 p.m., and the first concert is at 7:00.
Of course, there will be a program on site with all the information.
For those who have to choose one day, we recommend Saturday, since it is the busiest day - from 9:00 a.m. until the next morning.
"The names of the places are available on the website www.sansusi.lv",says Armands Siliņš.
The most famous artists include violinist Eva Bindere, cellist Kristine Blaumane, opera star Inga Kalna, clarinetist Guntas Kuzma, trumpeter Jānis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zariņš, the Quadra and RIX quartets and even the Estonian air acrobat Grete Gross, who together with Latvian musicians Erik Kirschfeld, Martin Zilbert and actress Anci Strazda created the contemporary circus show Confines about the inner struggle of the artist.
The festival also includes new works.
The children's show "Kukainis" (The Cockroaches), composed by Olesja Kozlovska and Jacobs Niemanis, based on the story of F. Kafka, will be presented by entomologist (cockroach researcher) Ugis Piterans, with the participation of Armandu Silin, musicians and actors.
Oskar Herliņš composed the first Stycki Quartet, while Anna Kyrse - Opera of the Eye, a performance in which the main characters directed by Andra Kalnozola with video projections by Katarina Neiburg and scenography by Andra Eglish will be three small trees in a small puddle in a three-hectare wide calcaree.
The songs, sung by Laima Lediņa, Dinara Rudāne and Sigmar Grass, are about a romantic relationship, just as the Enlightenment Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus had written in his study of the Marriage of the Tree (1729).
The Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro will be opened today by one of the greatest hopes of the Latvian delegation, the sevens athlete Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa.
Ikaunice-Admidiņa will start the 100m hurdles at 15.35 Latvian time, and the high jump at 16.50.
The night before Saturday, the men will begin their race at 2:35 a.m., and the men will begin their 200-meter dash at 4:05 a.m.
The heptathlon will conclude on Saturday with the long jump, the shot put, and the 800-meter run.
Before the Olympics, Ikaunice-Admidiń, who won bronze at the World Championships last year, was named as a contender for the Olympic Games medal.
In May, the Latvians set a new national record (6622 points) and won second place in the prestigious sevens competition in Gec, Austria.
Ikauniece-Admidiņa also participated in the 2012 London Olympics, where she won ninth place with a repeat of the Latvian record.
In the past year and a half, the athlete has broken the national record four times.
Today at 16:00 the Latvian judoka Artur Nikiforenko will compete in the 100 kg category, where he will first face Azerbaijani athlete Ušang Kukuri.
For Judith, this will be her first Olympic Games.
LETA has already reported that Latvian judo fighter Yevgeny Borodavko lost his first fight in the 100 kg weight category on Thursday.
He was joined by Japanese Hagu Ryunoski, who later won the bronze.
In 2000, Vsevolod Zelonij brought Latvia the Olympic bronze medal, but in the next four Olympic Games, Latvian judas won only one victory in seven fights, which was won by Borodavko in London.
At 16.30 after the Latvian time, the qualifying competition will start in the shooting of Dainis Upelnieks, but the selection will end on Saturday.
The Olympic ticket was issued to Upelnieks on the day the official composition of the Latvian delegation was announced, but he later told LETA that he had been relatively safe since April.
The athlete arrived at the Olympic venue as one of the first Latvian athletes, trying to make the most of the training opportunities in the competition in shooting.
The three races that will end after Latvia's time will be made by the Olympic Games debutant 17-year-old Latvian rower Ketija Birzule, who competes in the RS:X class.
After three days, or nine trips, Birzule is currently ranked 25th among 26 athletes.
And on Saturday, there will be a decisive medal round.
Today, the final event is scheduled to be the Academic Airing Competition, where the Latvian Sanitai Pushpure, representing Ireland, will compete.
The third day of the race was cancelled due to bad weather.
The girls at 7:10 p.m. will compete in the C/D semifinal in ladies' singles for the 13th place in the Olympics.
In the second quarterfinal, she finished fourth, moving from third to a medal position of 0.65 seconds behind.
The Puchpur 13th place was won four years ago in London, when he also represented Ireland.
Today, the Olympic Games will have 24 sets of medals, including in archery, athletics, cycling, jumping, throwing, jumping, judo, shooting, swimming, tennis, and weightlifting.
Reed claims that if Clinton is elected president, she will appoint Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid is confident that if he becomes president, he will nominate Merrick Garland to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Senate Republicans have been blocking Garland's confirmation since March, when President Obama nominated him.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has announced that the next president will choose a replacement for the current Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said during his conference call on Wednesday that he was convinced that Clinton would choose Garland.
Reid's representative later said he had not personally discussed the issue with Clinton and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team would not "save the ship" by choosing another.
Garland is the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said that Republicans blocking Garland's nomination were "deceitful" and acting in the interest of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also said that Trump is not fit to be president.
The Treat announces a calendar of cailphotos for women and men.
Treats magazine will be working with photographer David Belmeyer to create the 2017 calendar in the style of the 1970s Pirelli.
The 2017 NU Museum calendar is set to showcase new supermodels rather than naked celebrities.
Earlier this year, Steve Shaw, the magazine's third president, announced that his erotic art magazine was different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is a men's magazine".
This magazine is for women.
It looks like he's talking about the calendar, too.
In a press release on the making of the calendar, Shaw states: "We need to return to the innocent and classic depiction of nudity, where the female body is not submissive, but inspires both women and men".
Women will want to participate in this project because it's a great work of art.
Models can submit their photos electronically or in person at the casting sessions in Los Angeles and New York.
A customer on the back, testing a motorcycle, starts to run.
At 10am on the 10th of August, a Yamaha YZ250 motorcycle was stolen from a house in Rembates, a motorcycle that had never been registered, according to the National Police.
The owner of the motorcycle had tried to sell the power by means of an advertisement.
At the appointed time, a potential buyer arrived, got on his motorcycle as if it were a gift, and left.
The officers of the Ogres police station of the Riga Regional Police Department ask that anyone who can provide any information useful for the investigation in connection with the criminal offense that has occurred, please withdraw.
Please call: 65002403 (during working hours) or 65002400 (all day).

The Greenland shark is the world's longest-living vertebrate - video review
Scientists claim that the Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate on the planet.
Shark researcher Julius Nielsen says that the record for longevity is held by a female, who may be 272 to 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects request to close shops in Jungle Camp.
A French court rejected a request by the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, which is home to thousands of refugees.
At a court hearing this week, the Calais government said the state should demolish 72 makeshift stores where people sell various goods such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer freezing services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The Prefecture of Calais indicated that these self-constructed companies had to be dismantled because they created a building economy and did not pay taxes, as well as creating fire and sanitary risks.
The representatives of the Humana group explained to the court that these small businesses are essential because the food provided by the government and the support group does not meet the needs of the camp, which continues to grow in population.
They also pointed out that self-run shops and restaurants often offer free shelter and meals to those who need it most.
The Lille court found that there was no legal basis to deport the people who had set up 72 self-help shops, but that is what the Prefect of Calais was concerned about.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a role beyond simply providing food for people who live in "extremely poor conditions".
He pointed out that these places are peaceful gathering places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites at risk of being overwhelmed is the Jungle Book Kids camp café, which provides over 200 free meals a day, English and French language classes and shelter counselling for hundreds of unaccompanied vulnerable minors.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect children's coffee shops.
The letter to the Guardian stated that the closure of the café "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are as young as 8 years old".
On Friday, two charities, Aid to Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, reported that the number of people in the Jungle camp had risen to 9,000, the highest since the summer's surge of migrants.
Great Britain wins silver in the Rugby Sevens series, as Fiji's national team skillfully extracts gold.
The British team's impressive run of rugby sevens came to an end on Thursday when they were beaten 43-7 by Fiji in the thrilling final at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.
Fiji has shown mastery in the booms, the booms with the feet, the supporting booms, and the brute force booms, winning gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
The silver medal was the third medal for Great Britain at the time, and the British team could boast of their success in the first Rugby 7s tournament in the Olympics, where they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The intense semi-final battle, in which the Boxers were drawn 7-5 in the first half of the day, may have echoed in the final for Great Britain.
But in any case, the Fiji selection is in top form right now to beat the 15 man squad.
Although unlikely, a certain comfort for Britain may be the fact that at least one Briton has won a gold medal, namely Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, a former England coach from Wimbledon.
For Britain, it was a thrilling adventure.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide Rugby Sevens.
They only lost one game this time.
The loss is painful, but the growth is amazing.
Fiji had a spectacular start to the match, diverting British power from the pleasure of the game.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his crew, it was like a collision with several opposing buses, and the World Series champions took the lead with a 5-0 as Osea Collinisu got the first down.
In the final four minutes, Jerry Tuway added to his lead by landing on the right wing.
It was 12-0, and the British team hadn't even really touched the ball.
Mitchell's powerful technique kept the feisty Leoni Nakarava from scoring three points, but it had little effect on Fiji's result.
In the seventh minute of the match, Jasa Veremalua scored a touchdown in the right corner, consolidating his lead over Great Britain to 17:0.
After the overtime, Nakarava increased the lead even more and there was more than a minute left until the end... of the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some of the unfortunate British power tricks and crossed the line to score points.
The score was 29-0 on the ground.
It seems Fiji was born to play rugby sevens, while the British are just learning.
In fact, that is true.
The British team made a radical change in the half, moving the Fijian line... a full four minutes, which was good by the standards of the first half, until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team performance, scored a few more points for the Fijian team.
Den Norton scored for the British team with a 36-7 left-hander, but the game was already lost, while the South Sea fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
The Fijians' optimistic attitude cannot fail to impress.
Mata William made Fiji's victory even sweeter with another touchdown at the end of the game.
With the game over, Fiji could start to celebrate, but the British, after their defeat, could only sit in the greenhouse.
In the first half of the day, Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals, while the British were ahead of South Africa, who were eliminated in a very close match, with the South Africans losing by just a few points.
In the first half, Kyle Brown put the Boxes in the lead, but in the second half, Dan Norton crossed the line with a quick mastery and put the ball between the posts, ensuring the British victory.
The team's performance was further enhanced by the superb performance of Marcus Watson, who is the brother of England's Rugby 15 player, Anthony.
The fight against cancer inspired Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win the air racing competition.
It's going to be the most exciting gold medal of this competition, and it's already saying a lot.
From the first to the last autumn, the golden moment of Helena Glover and Heather Stanning had a special significance in the Estacio da Lagoa circuit.
Although there are only two athletes on the boat, they were accompanied by Robin William, who inspired them to win their second Olympic gold medal in the women's pair, becoming the first British women in the history of sport to achieve such a feat.
They dominated, as they won their 39th straight, unprecedented victory.
The two great athletes, who gracefully slide across the water, do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind every gold medal is a team of people who work hard to make sure that athletes are constantly improving their performance, and the biggest contributor to their success is a coach who, 30 months ago, didn't know if he would live to see this day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
He said it disappeared as fast as it came.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be operated on, and it did.
If you don't, it'll spread all over your body.
And it would get out of control.
It changes your perspective a little bit.
William was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate that William was able to begin the recovery process at the start of the 2014 off-season and to reduce the length of the break to a minimum, so to speak.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
It stimulated the recovery.
I was in the hospital and I could run 6, 10, and even 15 meters, even though the doctor said it would take a few steps.
That's how it started.
Airing is a challenge in itself, but this time it was even more challenging.
After the victory, the first thought was of Williams, who had been very anxious all morning and had been talking more than usual in a state of anxiety.
Stanning, who served in the Royal Artillery in Afghanistan, said: "It was an emotionally difficult week, but it means a lot to me".
It just confirms how much this means to us and how much Helen and Robin and I have worked.
The three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
We couldn't have done it without Robin, so big thanks to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I can't think of a better trainer or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in five years.
Paris is reaching such a tremendous speed that no competitor can match it.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close in, the dominance of Stannis and Glover was too great.
We felt every moment.
Helen said, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm".
It's really important to keep your focus.
We got off to a good start, but at the same time, we were not very optimistic.
Our goal that day was not to break records, but simply to perform well and win races, and that is what we did.
A few years to decide what to do next.
Next month, Glover and TV adventurer Steve Bashall are getting married.
For now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say that this was my last race.
It would have been too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience, and I was very excited.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "It feels fantastic".

The cute and cuddly DTLA pups are undergoing a domestic transformation.
To mark the 90th anniversary of the Los Angeles Central Library, with what else?
Koliev's position as head of the JIT is "a career to the last".
According to him, now Prime Minister Kuczynski (Union of Greens and Farmers) and Finance Minister Dana Reznik-Ozola (Union of Greens and Farmers) are already "of primary importance" to lead the approved Finance Minister Koliev's candidates in the office of the Minister of Finance.
Rajewski said that the appointment of both Kuczynski and Reżniece-Ozola as the head of the WIPO in this government is the "first big decision" that could affect their future as politicians.
If he now changes his position on the candidate for the post of head of the SDI, it will negatively affect his image in the state administration.
The next week's Cabinet meeting will include a question on the transfer of the head of the KGB Kolegyov to the post of Director General of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, according to the government's agenda.
Kolegov was appointed to the post of CEO by Finance Minister Reizniece-Ozola after the resignation of Inara Petersson and the unsuccessful bid for the post of CEO.
The acting head of the VID, Dace Pelēkā, admitted in an interview with Latvijas Radio on Thursday, August 11, that if she was offered the post of head, she could accept it.
The Minister of Finance later admitted that he had not considered other candidates for the post of CEO at the time.
Raivis Dzintars, the head of the National Union faction in the Parliament, also acknowledged that the NA still supports Kolegov in the leadership of the NLD.
In Spain, the chances of reducing the budget deficit are jeopardised by the failure to form a government.
On 12 July the European Commission (EC) concluded that Spain and Portugal had not implemented measures of sufficient size to bring the deficit level down to the euro area's 3% of GDP target.
Despite the austerity measures implemented, Portugal's budget deficit was estimated at 4.4% of GDP at the end of last year, while Spain's was 5.1% of GDP.
However, the European Commission decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while setting fiscal targets for the near term.
One of the reasons why the EC has not yet imposed sanctions on both countries is the growing Euroscepticism in many European Union countries.
Additional sanctions would only exacerbate this negative sentiment.
Critics, however, point out that the EC is inconsistent in its decisions, agreeing to a set of rules from the outset and then failing to apply them in practice.
For example, the president of Germany's Bundesbank, Jens Veidmann, has said that Europe is losing its credibility by creating the impression among its citizens that European Union rules are recommendative rather than binding.
The Commission has now proposed and all Member States have agreed to extend the deadline for closing the deficit by the end of this year for Portugal and by 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission intends to review the progress made by both countries in the coming months, while indicating that both Spain and Portugal should be prepared to introduce further savings measures if circumstances so require.
Initial projections suggest that Portugal could achieve its target on time and that the deficit could be reduced to 2,5% of GDP as early as this year.
This means that the government of this country has to implement austerity measures of 0.25% of GDP this year under the Stability Programme.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with additional attention to controlling the cost of purchasing goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complex.
The budget deficit should be reduced to 4,6% of GDP this year, to 3,1% next year and to 2,2% in 2018.
In addition, for the next two years, the consolidation measures must amount to 0,5% of GDP each year.
The achievement of these objectives is made all the more difficult by the fact that it has taken eight months for the Spanish political parties to agree on the formation of a government, and the likelihood that Spain may have to hold a general election for the third time in the year is growing.
However, opinion polls show that even a third election would not significantly change the political landscape of the country.
The most popular party is still the People's Party, led by current Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, which would again receive less than 33% of the vote.
Only the Socialists have seen a slight increase in popularity, while the anti-austerity parties Podemos (We Can) and Ciudadanos (Pilson) have seen a slight decrease.
The People's Party wants to get the Socialists and Ciudadanos into government later this month, otherwise it will not be able to adopt and submit the draft budget for 2017 to the European Commission for approval by mid-October.
As the representative of the People's Party in the parliamentary group, Rafael Hernando, has said, if the government fails to be formed and a third general election is held, Spain will become the laughingstock of Europe.
The purity of the seabed in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
After five years of surveying the beaches, activists have found that the number of waste found is increasing every year, and this is largely the fault of the visitors.
The most polluted swimming pools are in Rio de Janeiro.
The city says that although the swimming pools are cleaned daily, it is difficult to control the number of unhygienic visitors.
In addition, the waste left on land can be contaminated by rainfall, greatly affecting the water quality.
Apart from the beaches of Lipa and some places in Kurzeme, the cleanliness of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This is the message that the My Sea campaign volunteers have been spreading this week.
After five years of walking along the Riga Bay, activists have found that the amount of waste people leave behind has increased every 100 meters.
Unfortunately, this year, that critical assessment has come true.
"We see this as the year when the amount of waste on a 100 metre beach could exceed 200 units", says the representative of the 'Mana Sea' expedition, Jānis Ulme.
Radio Latvia called him and he was on the beach of Tuja, where the volunteer walk along the Gulf of Riga continues.
This year, among the various household waste and picnic items, we were left to pick up even the daylight bulbs that had been left behind by the sand.
According to Ulme, a participant and organizer of the march, the people are to blame for the pollution.
"The main source is the beachgoers themselves, as more than half of the total waste is plastic, various types of waste, from bags, pieces of plastic that have already decomposed and cannot be identified, to cigarette butts, bottles and baskets", says Ulme.
The dirtiest beaches include those in Riga.
For example, in Davao City, on average, nearly 800 pieces of waste are collected every 100 meters, which is a critical amount.
The campaign also explains that the warning or prohibition signs are not everywhere, but are almost everywhere.
"The average figures for all three Riga swimming pools together - Daugavpils, Vakarbuulilis and Vecāķis - are unfortunately quite large and far exceed the desired target towards which Latvia is moving, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020", concludes the environmental advocate.
The cleaning of the swimming pool in Riga is carried out every day, even twice on the hottest days of summer, explains the Chamber's representative, Ugi Vidauskis.
However, dealing with unclean visitors is not easy.
We're back to this question of human culture.
"Those who chew, drink, smoke, and do all the things they shouldn't do, even the special signs don't work", says Vidauskis.
The Commission therefore calls on swimming pool visitors to report the polluters to the police.
You can call the police, you can safely point out these violations, and you can fight them all.
Maybe we can put some new warnings in, but like I said, it's not gonna make a whole lot of difference.
"We all just have to be together and be intolerant of these kinds of offenders", he stresses.
Meanwhile, the Health Inspectorate has already carried out the fourth bathing water quality test this summer, which may lead to a ban on official bathing sites.
This year, as in previous years, the water quality is good and satisfactory.
The current situation is that the water quality in all 56 bathing areas has been good at all times and there are no bathing restrictions.
"We will be testing for the last time at the end of August", says the inspector's senior environmental health expert, Normund Kadics.
During heavy rainfall, the waste that is left on land can be washed into the water.
This, in turn, can affect its quality, says an environmental expert.
The rotation of the Russian elite continues with a change of leadership in the Putin administration.
You quit your job?
Vladimir Putin told Russian media that Sergei Ivanov left the post of Special Presidential Representative for Nature Conservation, Ecology and Transportation by his own choice.
Announcing the change, Putin praised Ivanov on television: "Dear Sergei Borisovich, we have been working with you for many years and doing it successfully".
I'm satisfied with the way you've handled your duties.
I will remember our agreement not to use you as the head of the presidential administration for more than four years.
So I understand your desire to change your field of operations.
And I hope that in your new job, you will also make the most of your knowledge and experience.
However, it is noted that the leadership of the presidential administration is a very important position and this made Ivanov one of the most powerful people in the country.
With the Russian parliament elections due next month, there are fears that the step could be linked to a power struggle within Russia's political elite.
Ivanov was also mentioned as a possible Putin deputy in the presidential office, so the claim that he himself wanted to take the post of presidential representative on issues of nature protection and transportation created doubts.
According to the Lsm.lv archive, Ivanov is the General-Lieutenant of the VDK and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been a long-time and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his career in the intelligence service in 1975 when he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
In turn, he was appointed Secretary of the Security Council of Russia at the end of the first Russian President Boris Yeltsin's reign.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, the "Information Security Doctrine" developed by Ivanova was approved, which included the revival of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001 Sergey Ivanov became the Minister of Defence of Russia, and in 2005 he became the Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of Russian defence industry enterprises and arms exports.
The so-called 'government of the people's Republic of Donetsk' was established in the 'Lugansk People's Republic' in October 2014 and is responsible for the 'development and strengthening of the state of Donetsk'.
The blame comes from a family in the Soviet party elite.
Vaino was reportedly recommended by Ivanov himself for the post of Head of the Presidential Administration.
Anton and I have known each other for a long time.
Since we were under your command, working for the government.
And for the past five years, we've been in touch almost every day.
"So I am convinced that, given all his professional and personal qualities, he is ready for this job", Ivanov said.
The blame comes from a family that belonged to the Soviet party elite.
Her grandfather Karl held high positions in the Communist Party of Estonia, including ten years as its first secretary until 1988.
The online publication "Meduza" with reference to the book "Igaunia's self-renunciation and independence" says that in the late 80s Karls Vaino asked Moscow for permission to use force against demonstrators.
However, he was rejected and soon lost his job.
Shortly after that, Vaino moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino is a graduate of the Moscow Institute of International Relations and has a Japanese language proficiency.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the President's Office of the Prosecutor.
It has been reported that Russia has been rocked by the expulsions and even arrests of several high-ranking officials in recent weeks, including the replacement of several regional governors and federal representatives.
According to political analysts, President Vladimir Putin is overhauling the ruling elite ahead of the 2018 elections.
One of the main features is that the power structures are increasingly represented in the leadership.
Judo champion Nikiforenko also lost his first match at the Olympic Games.
This was the first round of the competition, and the Latvian judoka has finished his participation in the Olympic Games in 17th place.
Coach Oļegs Baskins told Latvian TV that Nikiforenko had very little hope, and that was already clear before the race.
He also discovered that the judo player had suffered a shoulder injury in the fight.
Interestingly, to qualify for the Olympic weightlifting trials, Nikiforenko had to compete in a different weight class than he was used to, namely, the 100-kilogram-underweight division.
The Azerbaijani peasant was over 25 kilograms heavier.
It has been reported that in the fight in the 100 kg category, Yevgeny Borodavko held out for two and a half minutes against Ryunosuki, until the opponent threw a clean victory.
Latvia thus finished the Rio judo competition.
Dreams disappear into the sands of Rio.
On Thursday, the judoka was given the injection by Yevgeny Borodovko.
Yes, he had a more formidable opponent, but ambition can sometimes surprise.
He didn't care.
The task of Artur Nikiforenko was even more difficult, because the experience was less and the opponent was also respectable.
The result is similar, although he lasted on the tatami for about a minute and a half longer than Borodovko.
Unfortunately, lately, the Latvian Jews have been lacking in ambition the most.
Since the demise of Gunars Kyrson and his financial friend Vladimir Shestakov, and the departure of Aleksandrs Jacekovich from Latvia, the "Golden Score" no longer exists - the development of judo is on a downward curve.
Jackevich, who consults the judges of Kazakhstan, and Vsevolod Zelony, who is not a member of the estate.
But if he doesn't, he won't.
And that is the prerogative of the Federation.
So, like from another galaxy, "Morning Panorama" sounded the promise of the President of the Latvian Judo Federation to win medals in Rio.
The flight is far from reality.
Last night we were looking forward to the beach volleyball match between Samoilov/Šmokdinski and Evandro/Pedru Solberg.
The intrigue is dead in the "dead" group, the losers are out of the game.
The Latvian duo had a slight deviation - they could also lose, but not more than by four points in two sets.
The tension was heightened during the previous game.
No one wanted to die, and that feeling was carried over the wind throughout the match.
The winds of the breeze added to the players' difficulties.
At first, it seemed like it might be our - which is the most comprehensive - ally.
But it didn't.
It was quite easy to play against the Latvian duo here.
Just wait for Samoilov to come out and let him do his thing.
The split against Canada, the split against Cuba at the end of the first set and the beginning of the third set, because the load was too much.
The little guy could do a little work back then, but when he had work, he did it for the glory.
Brazilian Samoilov could win in two sets with Šmejdini because he took the lead with 16:15 in the first, but also stayed on 16, also eliminating the limit of points lost.
But it was also possible to lose with 0-2, because in the second set the deficit was -4, however, also thanks to the wind, we managed to win.
The third one has already passed Evander's mark on the serve.
The chain was broken, the serve was not convincing, the second serve was not often too close to the net, and Samoilov had little choice in the resulting attack.
If there was a stranger in the field against the Cubs, Samuilov, then this time he worked better, and only to blame the loss on Sas would be unprofessional.
Kreilis was also wrong, and symbolically, the last bullet hit the block was him.
Lost the team.
This time, the ball was a bit of a fluke, with Evander's two strikes in the third set almost flying off the court, but the ball still hit the line.
Two of the guys were on the side of the line.
The video of the controversial episode also played in favor of the opponents.
If Evandro was getting beaten up by the serfs in the first two games, they were very productive against us.
It all adds up to a loss on the table.
Now, we need to calmly analyze the causes of the failure.
Perhaps, like many others, they should have lived next to the stadium, rather than with the delegation in the Olympic village.
It took two and a half hours to get there.
Maybe a little confidence from the seven semi-finals.
Maybe you shouldn't have played at Klagenfurt, but you should have come here sooner and acclimatized yourself better.
Maybe there was a mistake in the top of the athletic form.
More questions than answers.
Our little game is over.
The dream of medals is over.
What's next?
There are still some World Cups to come and the Masters of Jurmala.
Smuts and Samoilov have never been friends in their lives, and they never will be, because they have too many different personalities.
But you don't have to.
When you have a dream about winning Olympic medals, you may also think about getting a divorce, because you're not only going to blame yourself, but your partner.
It's not hard to get divorced, but it's much harder to find a worthy partner in Latvia.
Both brothers play the harp, but John and Tom have already tried and separated, while Mikhail Samoilov is still too young to start conquering the world's peaks.
You can try Harald Regge, Alexander Solovey, Edgar Tocco, to return to Martin Plejvan, but it will not be better than this variant, which has proven itself more than once in the World Cup.
The sands of the copacana did not make them laugh this time.
That's all there is to it.
Of course, there is the growing popularity of beach volleyball, the arrival of new couples, and the rarity of children under six feet in height.
It's not a guarantee of success, but it's a vital argument in the fight to win.
We're not gonna have any more.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to meet at venues provided by the organisers of the games, as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some of the tennis players don't stay in the Olympic village.
Some beach volleyball players have also found lodging in the Copacabana.
This time, the very modest lodgings offered to journalists were charged exorbitant prices.
So the choice fell on the apartment rent.
The risk is that they can sometimes be uncomfortable from a logistical point of view.
The risk is worth it this time.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovich, we rented apartments on the border of Kopakabana and Ipanema.
A whirlpool 200 meters away, a half hour to the beach arena.
The area is safe enough, because the favelas are very quiet, but you can't lose your guard here.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not what some people think, but the most professional sports journalist in the Russian media is Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. It looks like another medal dream was triggered on Friday morning.
Laura Ikauniece-Admidińa broke her own personal record in the 100m hurdles and the high jump.
But there are five more disciplines.
After a ten-year hiatus, "Porgy and Bess" is back in Leipzig.
The opera "Porgijs and Besa" was first performed in Latvia in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognized masterpiece has not been re-introduced.
That is why the organizers of the Caesars Festival of Arts and the Leibniz Art Forum, in close cooperation, decided to give the audience the opportunity to enjoy a George Gershwin's masterpiece.
"We are delighted that after a ten-year hiatus, the last time Liepāja had an opera, this concert version of the great George Gershwin's 'Porgy and Bess' is being performed in our newly opened 'The Great Gintars' Concert Hall", says the director of the 'Great Gintars' Concert Hall, Mr. Babo Bo Bo.
The opera "Porgi and Besa" is a story told in a brilliant musical language about love, its volatility, passion, as well as domestic tragedies and simple everyday pleasures.
It's a reflection of African-American vitality and music and rhythm.
It's this lack of political correctness in this opera, this lack of tolerance that makes it so alive.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in some ways really deep", says director Vyacheslav Kairis.
What I love most about listening to or playing this opera is always the kind of landmark -- the famous melodies, the famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, illuminating one character or another, or the chorus or the orchestra.
"It's the most exciting thing about this building", says Andris Poga, the musical director and conductor of the concert production of Porgy and Bess.
Opera house visitors agree that it is a grand event.
They are delighted to hear this world-famous opera by Gershwin.
It's a blessing to be able to breathe the world in Liepaja.
"Performed professionally", says Edgar Lamas, a visitor to the opera.
The concert was special in that the orchestra played for the first time in the newly opened concert hall "Lielais dzintars" and the opera concert was held for the first time.
The area around the renovated buildings of the Museum of Fine Arts could be named after Jan Rozenthal.
The city's vice mayor Andris Ameriks Rosenthal said at the opening of the anniversary exhibition that the museum's address could in the future be not Krišjāņa Valdemāra Street 10a, but Jaņa Rozentāla square 1.
The museum director, Māra Lāce, acknowledged that the change of address would create a significant bureaucratic burden, but generally accepted the idea and therefore agreed with the municipality's proposal.
The city of Riga laid the foundation for this idea in 1936 by creating a monument to Janim Rozentālam, who is buried at the museum.
The then director of the museum, Vilhelms Purvītis, was one of the initiators of the monument's construction.
In that way, this further action could be purely logical.
I'm a little bit guilty all the time, but William the Conqueror, where do we put his name?
"But if you, Mr. America, promise to think"... said Lăce.
It is reported that the National Art Museum building, after extensive renovation and modernization, will officially open its doors in May this year.
This week, the VEF will finally begin the reconstruction of the Palace of Culture.
The castle will be renovated by Velve for approximately EUR 11 million.
The plans include the renovation of several of the castle's rooms, including two viewing rooms, and the adaptation of the building for people with mobility problems.
The municipality of Riga has planned to raise €6 million from the European Union funds for the project, but Oligs Burov, the director of the Property Department of the municipality of Riga, admits that the project is not yet fully clear about the European funds.
"Despite the political will to start renovation work on the VEF Culture building, involving European Structural Funds, we have been waiting for months for a decision, a real action from the Finance Ministry officials, whether the money will be granted or not", says Burov.
Last December we were told that everything depended on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Finance Ministry received a letter from the European Commission telling them to make their own decisions, that Brussels would not make a decision here.
We are seeing another round of debate taking place, and we shall see what we can expect in the coming days.
'I want to say that the Riga City Hall guarantees without any doubt that this process will be started and completed on time,' says Burov.
It has already been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, the VEF Kulturpalace collectively held a farewell concert ahead of the building's soon-to-be-expected renovations.
Although a year had passed, the renovation of the building had not yet begun and the collective continued to work in unsuitable conditions.
In the strategy of the City of Riga's Department of Property, the renovation of the Cultural City of Riga was divided into seemingly independent groups of reconstruction works, each of which will provide for the implementation of different city functions.
The first is to improve the accessibility of the VEF Cultural City and the surrounding area.
It will provide for the improvement of the environment and the engineering communications, as well as the renovation of the building's façade.
The second is to improve the services offered by the VEF Cities of Culture.
It envisages restoring the building's interior, walls and ceilings, improving the stage and sound recording studios, and arranging the building's internal engineering communications.
Third - Improving the working conditions of emerging amateur collectives, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of "Liv" the legendary rock group can be introduced at an exhibition in Leipzig.
The exhibition will feature various Lions' items - photographs arranged in a timeline to reflect the group's activities from its inception until 2010, when the group's closure is announced.
The exhibition will also include the stage costumes, musical instruments, decorations and concert records, as well as other items that have not yet been shown to the general public, which reflect the creative activities of the group "Livi".
The exhibition will be supplemented by objects from the collection of the Museum of Liège.
The visual design of the exhibition was made in collaboration with the fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalniec.
Musicians associated with Livy and their relatives also responded to the invitation and shared both items and memories.
The origins of "Liv" are traced back to 1972, when a vocal instrumental ensemble was formed in the Cultural House of Leiden, led by Juris Pavītols.
The ensemble in its original form took part in the festival "Liepajas dzintars" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in the city and republic shows.
In 1976, a fateful meeting took place when Juris Pavittol met Erik Kijel and founded the group at the Metallurg Cultural Palace, inviting Ingrid Gutman, Andri Kruzin and Jani Grodu to join.
Over the years, the group's composition has changed many times.
Members have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
However, the desire to prove that Latvian folk music is able to live and exist has remained unchanged.
"The jeans, the muffins, the beards - they're a constant, and they're not the typical orchestra boys", says music critic Klaus Wauer.
In addition to the above musicians, the band included such outstanding musicians as Igo, Vilnis Russiņš, Modris Šterns, Valdis Starks, Laimis Rācenājs, Talis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Bryzis, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomass Klein and many others.
Admission to the exhibition is free.
The exhibition is open from 19 August to 30 October.
On August 27, the "LIVEFEST 2" celebration of the 40th anniversary of the group "LIVE" will be held in the Leipzig concert garden "Pūt, vējiņi".
For the first time in eight months, inflation is rising in Bulgaria.
In July, Bulgarian national statistics showed a monthly inflation rate of 1%.
This is the highest level since 2012 and the first above zero since October of the previous year, when it was positive (0.2%).
The average annual inflation rate after the PCI, over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous year, was -0,8%.
The CPI was 101,9% in July 2016 compared to the previous year and the monthly average inflation rate was 1,0%.
The Commission also noted that the increase in the number of new entrants was due to the increase in the number of new entrants.
The increase in the price of consumer goods in July 2016 compared to the previous month was recorded for the following categories of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and cultural events (6.3%); hotels and restaurants (1.2%); household goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); household appliances, household appliances and regular home decor (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as last month for alcohol and tobacco, household, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Zbigniew Stankevich: The time will come, and the truth will rise.
In an interview with Neatkarīga, Metropolitan Zbigniew Stankevičs, the archbishop of the Catholic Church in Latvia, emphasizes that if we want to give life strength, then the message of the Gospel must be at its center.
For the power of truth is greater than the boredom of evil.
Many are already on their way to the Feast of the Assumption in Aglona.
What message will the faithful receive there this year?
In recent years, the desire to have a major service at the Aglo has been expressed by the papal nuncio.
Thus, the main content of the message is also his.
It has also become a tradition for Bishop John Bull to lead the Way of the Cross.
He's also writing his own message.
I was conducting the vigil service the day before.
Last year I focused on Pope Francis' encyclical Laudato si' and updated the theme of the common home, the Earth, in the context of Latvia.
This year, of course, I'm watching what's happening in the world, and I'm trying to respond to it in my speech.
My approach is consistent with the church's recommendation that the gospel be the center of our lives.
It's about showing that the Gospel answers the most pressing problems of a person's life and inspires him to take a step forward.
Then it speaks to people.
But in the Lampas debate at Cessis, you said that we had to "return to the understanding of the full human being".
What do you mean?
Does this mean that the person is deviating from the church's message?
And does the church today have such a resource for conversion?
A man lies on the side of a road in the capital of India.
A man was found lying on the side of the road for an hour before being robbed, reports the BBC, without anyone's knowledge or explanation.
It is reported that the man, identified as Matybull, was riding a rickshaw by day but working as a security guard by night.
Mattias was driving home at 5:30 a.m. when he was hit by a car.
CCTV shows the driver getting out of the car to look at the victim, then driving away.
After an hour, when no one knew about the bleeding man, he was beaten by a giant.
About 90 minutes after the escape, police arrived and the victim was taken to the hospital where he died of his injuries.
Withdrawing her candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), Inga Koļegova, the head of the State Environmental Service, has saved the government from a meltdown, according to Ojārs Skudra, an associate professor at the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia.
Koliegov's explanation for withdrawing his candidacy in connection with the contradictions in the ruling coalition is related to the fact that he prevented the collapse of the government.
In a bitter conversation with the LETA agency, he said that he found it hard to imagine that Unity would support Koleegov's candidacy at the next government meeting next week.
Therefore, if the "Unity" ministers vote against and Koļegov is confirmed in office, it will lead to the resignation of the government.
The expert also believes that before announcing the withdrawal of her candidacy, Kolyegova consulted both the Minister of Finance Danu Reizniec-Ozolu and the Prime Minister Mari Kuczynski.
At the same time, it was a concession to Unity, which strongly opposed her candidacy.
When predicting whether the competition would succeed in finding a suitable candidate, Skudra acknowledged that there were two options - either a compromise figure would be chosen, or he would continue to lead the institution as the acting Director-General in Dace Pelēkā.
At the same time, he points out that if the Minister of Finance has so far stated that no other candidate is being considered, it is a sign to Pelēka that he cannot participate in the competition.
LETA has already reported that the head of the State Environmental Service Koliegaova has decided to withdraw her candidacy for the post of Director General of the SED.
Due to the objections of Unity, the government on Tuesday suspended Kozhegov's confirmation as the Director General of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for a week.
After the government's decision to postpone the decision, Koleegova confirmed that she was still ready to become the head of the EDA.
However, she later changed her mind - in a letter to Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola on Friday, she said that she was withdrawing her consent to the transfer to the post of head of the SDI and that this was not an easy choice for her.
The press secretary of Prime Minister Maara Kučinska, Andrej Vaivars, told LETA that a new competition would be held for the vacant post of Director General of the Ministry of Education.
There's been an accident in downtown involving a police car.
There was a traffic accident in the center of Riga this afternoon involving a State Police vehicle.
A police car with sound and light signals on crashed into a top-class van at the intersection of Krishyana Barona and Dzirnava Street.
Police are still trying to determine the exact cause of the accident, but preliminary reports indicate that the second car did not run over the police car.
A woman was hit.
The number of people who died in Riga this year
The Central Statistical Office (CSP) informed the agency that at the beginning of this year, there were 638 784 inhabitants in Riga, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when the capital was officially registered with 641 000 inhabitants.
In terms of population, the Latvian capital ranks 30th among the capitals of the European Union (EU) and large cities with a population of more than one million.
According to the EU statistics office Eurostat, Riga has the highest proportion of women - the Latvian capital is firmly in the top spot among the largest cities in Europe with 127 women for every 100 men.
All three Baltic capitals have the highest proportion of women per 100 men of the largest European cities: Vivienne has 123 women per 100 men, and Tallinn has 121.
The warning pictograms shall be displayed at the LNMM.
Warning signs - pictograms will be displayed at the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM) in the coming days, Baiba Gailīte, representative of the Property Department of the City of Riga, told LETA.
The museum's glass has now been successfully repaired of the damage caused by the skateboarders.
Warning icons will be placed on it in the coming days.
The residents are told that the area is usually slippery during rain and snow, and that cars are not allowed on it, nor are bicycles, skates, and roller skates.
Ushakov wrote about the social network at the time, saying that the damage posed no security risks, but "it would look nice", and the skateboards "would be messy".
New playgrounds for children and parents in Riga
This summer, the city of Riga has installed two new playgrounds in the city, in Kiipsaala and Čiekurkalna, which are now available to children.
A large, multifunctional roller boat with various climbing elements, bridges, toys, tubes and ski slopes is installed on the beach of the island.
The playground is designed for children of all ages.
The field also has shoulder poles and various balancing elements.
The fantasy world for young sailors is filled by the attraction's location on the banks of the river with a view of the passenger port and the cruise ships visible there.
The playground between the 4th and 5th crossings of Čiekurkalna has a playhouse, boots, a stairway, a balance bridge, a shovel, a play bump and other play elements, as well as an exercise area with rings for strength and coordination exercises, a playground and other sports elements.
The floor area is covered with a rubber cover of different colours.
A new, colorful brick wall has been installed on the side of the street, right up to the toy store.
A reconstructed section of road has been discovered in Medam.
Transport Minister Uldis Augulis, the management of the Latvian State Roads (LVC) and representatives of the construction company SIA "Binders" and the local authorities today opened the section of the reconstructed main state highway Russian border (Grebneva) -Rezekne-Daugavpils-Lithuanian border (Medumi) (A13) from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163.05 km).
Roads are the state's calling card, especially border roads, so it's a special pleasure to discover a reconstructed section of the border with our neighbours to the south.
This is another example of the improvement in the situation on the main national roads thanks to the co-financing of the European Union funds.
'According to the forecasts, the funds available for roads during this planning period will be used up in 2018, and we need to think about how to continue to maintain the most congested roads in very good quality, and also to provide mobility for the population in all regions of Latvia without European Union funding,' stressed Uldis Augulis, turning the symbolic ribbon.
The Minister of Transport also indicated that proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing of Latvian roads will be presented to the Government in the near future.
Construction work on the section from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156.4.-163.05 km) was started by SIA Binders last year and continued this year after a technological break.
The reconstruction cost is EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), the project is co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
'The road section being reconstructed is a completely new road construction and next year the repair work will start on the next section from Medunas to Daugavpils itself, until the entire road from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpils is repaired,' said LVC's Chairman of the Board, Mr Lange.
The main national highways are the most congested and we plan to have all the main national highways in good condition by 2018.
The next challenge will be to maintain them in good quality by providing periodic maintenance in a timely manner and to replace the asphalt pavement every 7 to 9 years.
'This will of course require adequate funding and all road users are looking to the expert group's proposals for a road funding system,' said Mr Lange.
The project included the rehabilitation of road connections and lighting in the centre of Medumu.
Significant earthworks: four phases of large-scale clearing and extensive recording and deposition works, levelling of the road profile, which was previously very uneven.
The public transport stops have also been renovated and a new public transport turn-around area has been built.
The road was previously unsuitable for the terrain and the surrounding terrain was not clear due to the mountain valleys, as well as the old road shared the terrain.
The next construction season is planned to restore the section of the highway from the city border of Daugavpils to the now reconstructed section (144.80-156.40 km).
This year, LVC plans to carry out more than 1100 kilometres of road works of various types.
The LVC has also provided information on the road network for the period from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2013.
"The right combination of foods is essential to achieve the desired weight loss", admits Lithuanian dietician Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene.
And it is easy to do so during the summer months when our own gardens produce fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs.
A well-thought-out combination of foods can help not only to reduce excess weight but also to promote various bodily processes in a targeted way.
The combination of pasta and vinegar is a good one, as it provides a lasting satiety and helps to combat fat.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that the plant has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us feel better.
Cayenne pepper and protein-rich foods such as poultry or protein shakes not only make you feel full but also reduce cravings for large meals at subsequent meals.
This combination of foods can increase post-meal calorie burn by up to 35%.
Studies have shown that cayenne pepper can help to get rid of the fatty deposits around the abdomen.
The essential nutrient choline is found in oats, and paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
Getting enough of these nutrients can reduce cortisol levels and, in turn, fat accumulation around the midsection.
The freshly squeezed coat of oats is another tasty, fat-burning breakfast dish worth including in your menu.
The leaves and berries of the olive contain fiber that Canadian scientists have found to control ghrelin, an appetite-stimulating hormone, and thus hunger.
Moreover, the berries contain polyphenols that help to reduce weight and prevent fat formation.
Vegetables and protein can also do wonders for weight loss.
This combination can create a sense of home.
The leaves contain water and fiber, which make them feel sweet.
At the same time, the protein slows down digestion and makes you feel full for longer.
For lunch, you can eat eggs with salads or make a protein shake from the ready-made mixture and enjoy it with your favorite vegetables.
What product combinations to avoid
In plants, sugars are monosaccharides or disaccharides, compounds of one or two molecules.
In contrast, the starch in vegetables is a polysaccharide.
The cells divide mechanically in the stomach, but they don't divide chemically until they reach the third or fourth stage of digestion, which is in the intestines.
The hardness is divided into three distinct stages, starting in the mouth.
Therefore, it is essential that you avoid eating salty foods immediately after a meal.
When solid food is eaten immediately after a meal, it is "squeezed" into the stomach along with other food, where it is not chemically digested, and it starts to swell.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates, or other carbohydrate-rich foods with lemons, limes, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples, or other sour fruits.
The ptyalin enzyme in the saliva only works in a changing environment.
The fruit acid not only slows the digestion of carbohydrates but also promotes their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, ham and beef, cheese and eggs or cheese and ham, meat and milk, eggs and milk or ham and milk and similar protein-rich products in the same meal.
It requires different digestive juices, each with different strengths, characteristics, and timing of entry into the stomach.
Arbutus, honeydew, muscat, and other melons should always be eaten separately from other dishes.
The melons are not digested if they are in the stomach with other food.
Fat combined with protein-rich products.
Fats combine well with fat, but the same cannot be said of fat and protein - fats that inhibit protein digestion.
Protein can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If you consume large amounts of protein-rich foods, avoid fat altogether.
This also applies to the use of shellfish - it is not advisable to combine a large quantity of shellfish (saturated proteins) with whole avocados (saturated fats).
This combination prevents effective weight loss.
What better way to cook?
"The cooking and heat treatment of food causes a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the original nutrient content of the product", says the nutritionist.
In many cases, food is lost when it is cooked in water.
However, some foods have a nutritional value that increases when they are cooked.
The liquid left over after boiling the vegetables is used to make soup - in this way you do not lose the nutrients left in the water and you can eat them later.
It is recommended that vegetables be cooked, even steamed.
Thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene contained in tomatoes.
Cooking tomatoes for 30 minutes increases the amount of lycopene by 25%.
Thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of betakarotin, which is found in red, yellow and orange plants such as tomatoes, peaches, sweet potatoes and spinach.
The heat treatment of eggs and meat removes the natural properties of the proteins present, making them more easily digestible.
Also, the heat treatment of meat and eggs makes the iron and other minerals in these products more easily absorbed by the body.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing products may reduce the amount of vitamin C by 10% to 90%, but that freezing the fibre does not.
When combined with tomatoes, pumpkin can increase the body's absorption of iron, which in turn helps the brain and muscles function better.
Our bodies absorb up to 33 percent less non-fertilizing iron from plant products such as beans, leafy greens, and grain products than the blood-forming iron found in animal products such as beef, fish, and poultry.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-transforming iron by eating non-transforming iron products along with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to modify non-blood-forming iron so that it is more readily absorbed by our bodies.
Iron is needed to produce hemoglobin, which provides oxygen to the muscles and brain.
To get the most out of your salads, add healthy fats, such as olive or flaxseed oil.
When making a glass of buttermilk, add a vitamin D-rich salmon or sardine to the unleavened yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the absorption of calcium in the intestines and plays an important role in the formation of bone.
Oats (as well as other whole grains) along with sources of vitamin C, such as raisins, grapefruits, oats, and other fruits or oats, help to stabilize cholesterol levels and to prevent arterial blockage.
Snapchat's "Anime" effect is criticized for its use of cartoon characters
Snapchat says the filter was inspired by an animation, but some commenters say it's racist and irrelevant.
With this kind of a flash effect, Snapchat allows its 150 million users to change reality in a ridiculous way every day, and play with their identities.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a bull, like in a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
The drugs are blurry, image-destroying devices that generate more than 30 million transformed selfies a day.
Any mistakes are quickly made public.
Snapchat's lens effects have been criticized in the past, with accusations that the app promotes too dark or pale skin tones as the ideal beauty standard.
This week, new lens effects were released that allow users to create spiky eyes, spiky teeth and shaped lips, and some critics have called it a racist cartoon of the "yellow shirt" of the Aztecs.
It was also asked whether such contradictions do not indicate that the company has a bigger diversity problem.
News and public outcry erupted on Tuesday when The Verge and Motherboard reported that the effects of the leak had been removed from the app.
The company explained that the purpose of the leap is to portray Anime idols, not to caricature people of Asian descent.
But for people who have experienced racism, these effects resembled painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied the similarity to Anime.
A tweet about the images by Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, who said in an email that the effects of the leap were "disgusting and inappropriate, to say the least".
She adds that it is difficult not to notice the obvious similarities between Asian cartoons and the bat effect.
This shows that the lens effect is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into this culture trap.
American culture, too, is engaged in a relentless battle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood to the devices we use in our daily lives.
And Snapchat's large, racially diverse, young audience, unlike the older population, is more sensitive to these things.
If Snapchat is creating an image that offends users, "these days, things like that don't go unnoticed", said 25-year-old Katie Zhou in an interview on Thursday.
On Wednesday, Zhou, product manager for Medium, deleted his Snapchat app and advised others to do the same.
In her Medium article and phone interview, she explained that she believes race issues are caused by Snapchat's employment policies that do not sufficiently support racial diversity.
Zhou criticized the management of the company, which is mostly made up of white men, and then ended his post with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat.
"It means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so the decisions are allowed, or there are people of another race working in the company, but they don't take a job that allows them to express their opinions in a safe and comfortable way", says Zhou, a Chinese-American.
Her views are shared by others, but Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose the number of employees representing different races, stating that it is a private company.
Snapchat declined to discuss the background of its employees, but its spokesperson revealed that the company had hired a human resources specialist who would focus on bringing underrepresented racial minorities into the company and promote inclusion.
Zhou, on the other hand, does not update his Snapchat account, adding, "It's interesting if they really need more users like us to understand that this is not right".
The House reports that military officials have been falsifying reports on the Islamic State.
In a statement released Thursday, the House of Representatives noted that the U.S. Central Command has distorted reports by portraying the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as more optimistic than it actually is.
Central Intelligence Agency analysts are expressing general dissatisfaction with the interim report of the task force created by Republican representatives on the Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Defense Financing Subcommittee, noting that their leadership has been monitoring reports of American successes against the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida, that oversees U.S. military operations in the Far East and Central Asia.
The latest news on this report is that the intelligence reports, which have been confirmed by senior Centcom leaders, portray the US fight against terrorism more positively than it actually is, and the facts have been regularly rounded up to show better performance than other intelligence analyses.
California Republican Representative Ken Calvert says: "The Centcom action is unacceptable - our troops are the ones who suffer when our policymakers receive untrue reports".
Centcom's management failures are being sought at the highest levels of the organization.
This 10-page report details the problems that exist in the Central Command's reflection and analysis of American efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide conclusive evidence that senior Obama administration officials were involved in tampering with the reports, it does indicate that some pressure was put on analysts by Centcom leadership to portray a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report states that in the first half of 2015, Central Government press releases, statements and Congressional reports portrayed the situation in a significantly more positive light than it actually was.
For example, Centcom officials publicly stated that the Mosul recovery operation could start as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul is the second largest city in Iraq that is still under the control of the Islamic State.
Mike Pompeo, spokesman for the Kansas Republican Party, said in a report: "The months of investigation have clearly demonstrated this".
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, top U.S. Central Command officials twisted the reports to portray the threat of ISIS in Iraq as weaker than it actually was.
The Republican Party set up a task force after learning that analysts were concerned that information about the Islamic State was being suppressed.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new revelations in this case.
The Ministry of Defence Inspectorate General is investigating the activities of the CENTCOM intelligence service.
The Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own report Thursday, agreeing with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
Democratic Representative Adams B. Schiff in his report states that from 2014 to 2015, Centcom over-restricted intelligence assessment reporting related to ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr. Shifa explains that this process "impeded the spread of information", undermined the work ethic of the analysts and "spread facts that were not true".
But Schiff and his fellow Democrats added that there is no evidence that the White House pressured Centcom analysts to produce reports on the basis of "a pre-determined or political stance".
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the congressional investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's inspector general had launched an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans said the Pentagon would not comment on the congressional report while the investigation is ongoing.
He also noted that experts sometimes interpret complex data differently, and the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Agency are calling for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not just about whether the bombing campaign against American heads in Iraq and Syria is successful (a view that is increasingly being expressed by the Department of Defense).
But last year's allegations raise questions about whether President Obama can fully rely on the Central Command's reports on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot spots.
The criticism of Islamic State's intelligence is reminiscent of events more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study claiming that the George W. Bush administration launched the Afghan war with little regard for its possible consequences.
Hooker also played a significant role in uncovering the Islamic State's intelligence.
Last year, officials reported that Hooker's team discovered that contrary to public reports, airstrikes on Islamic State oil facilities had not significantly worsened the financial position of the terrorist group, as they had built makeshift plants to sell the oil on the black market.
The Times reported in its September edition that the discovery did not occur outside the Central Administration.
The commander of Centcom at the time, General Lloyd Austin III, came under sharp criticism because many lawmakers felt that the war reports were overly positive.
In April, General Austin was dismissed and replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S.A. meets Great Britain in women's field hockey, and the U.S.A. wins, marking its fourth straight victory.
The day after the 6-1 win over Japan, on Thursday, Katie Bama scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team as the Americans defeated the Indian team 3-0.
To score five goals in two games is an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bama said she could not remember ever having done it.
She said, "I have no idea".
I'm not the type of person who counts their balls.
But she knows that the Americans have a 4-0 record at the Olympics, which puts them in the same group as Great Britain, which went undefeated after beating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
England and the United States will meet on Saturday to play their final matches in the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals and the match will only determine which team will take the first place in the six-team group and which the second.
The first-place winner will avoid a close encounter with the strong Dutch island, the leader of the second group.
And despite the lack of open play on Saturday, the Americans have already taken a surprise by finishing last in the 12-team field in London four years ago.
Bama was on that team.
She grew up in Bluebel, first playing field hockey at the age of 3 (her older twin sisters were already involved in the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming the youngest player in the team's history.
She missed the 2008 Olympic Games because she didn't make the final.
But 2012 was a bad year for her and her team.
The next year, the Englishman Craig Parhams was appointed as the team's coach and everything changed for the better.
Bama called it "cultural, mental, and physical changes".
We didn't have as much work in London as we do now.
We've changed everything from the ground up.
In the game on Thursday, Bama opened the scoring by scoring in the first half with a backhanded shot from close range.
India started the game without a win at home, but their selection was very tight and kept a minimal score of 0-1 until the end of the third period, when Bama again scored.
She put the ball into the opposing zone on the left side of the court, then she thought about going to the middle of the court and putting the ball in the opposing goal, putting the Americans 2-0 up.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzalez scored another goal.
This was the first game on the ground for U.S. goaltender Jackie Briggs, with one goal in each of the first three games.
She's out of her mind.
And so is Bam.
"We're doing very well", said Paham, "but how well we are will be seen in the game on Saturday.
The most depressing meal of the depression is the "Sweet Meal".
In March 1933, shortly after his election as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down in the Oval Office to hold a meal.
President Roosevelt enjoyed such delicate culinary delights as steak liver stew and Maryland blueberry soup.
But his meal today was more than adequate: a bowl of eggs in tomato sauce, a potato stew, and a plum pudding for dessert.
"It's a way of showing solidarity with people who have been through a very hard time", says Jane Ziegelmann.
Her husband, Andrew Kou, adds: "It's also a message to the American people about how to eat".
The folks from Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
The last book, "The Sound of the Dragon", describes Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman Kou in his book "97 Apples" describes life through the food of a rented house on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
Their new collaborative work, "Saturated Meal", which Harper's will publish Tuesday, is a story about American food during the Great Depression.
In a show of culinary solidarity, they shared a meal with reporter Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a simple lunchroom in the Flatiron district that has been in operation since the Great Depression began in 1929.
Mrs. Ziegelmann, aged 54, ordered a butter loaf with grated cheese and chopped olives, while Mr. Kou, aged 57, ordered a turkey, potato dumplings, and vegetable salad.
When the reporter ordered a fake rabbit, the couple recognized that his choice was very appropriate for a conversation about food during the Great Depression.
Mrs. Ziegelmann said that the fake rabbit was very popular.
There was a groundhog, a rabbit, and a rabbit.
They were made from the basic ingredient and other ingredients that enriched the dish.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they're a lunch.
Mr. Koo was not in the mood.
"It seemed as if the stomach was full of lead", he added.
In the pre-depression years, the American lunch table was similar to the Swedish one, especially in rural areas.
The household prepared food for its men-workers and served freshly prepared salads for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
During World War I, it was the Americans who sent food to Europe. "The Meal of the Nations" describes how Americans adapted to the circumstances when America suddenly ceased to be a land of plenty.
"When food became the main focus of the American people's daily attention", says Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about this particular topic.
New budget diets became just as important: unfamiliar dishes such as forged rabbit and stir-fry became commonplace, stir-fries were "a great way to use up surplus", Ms. Ziegelman noted, because the dishes could hide unattractive ingredients under creamy sauces.
The fresh fruit was replaced by dried fruit.
Meat, which had been a staple of American Maltese cuisine for years, was now an extremely rare luxury item.
In a time when calories and nutrition were more important than taste, new, unseen formations were born.
In an old cookbook, Mrs. Ziegelmann found recipes for onions filled with peanut butter.
Mr. Koo adds: "It was not a popular addition to the lunch table".
"It was surreal", says Mrs. Siegelman.
Butter from the ground and baked onions are incompatible.
Many home cooking recipes are for times of need.
Household economists like Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Economics Office from 1923 to 1943, set the national eating patterns that were unprecedented before or since the Great Depression.
Publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they urged housewives to become "economists" and to take up such challenges as turning pasta and canes into a delicious meal.
The Maltese Salty is a delicacy of historical flavor.
Particularly interesting are the testimonies of how governments have treated their starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
Although he publicly talked about his simple childhood and eating in Iowa, in reality he ate like the smart millionaire he had become.
Mr. Ko says: "He liked European cuisine, such as fish and cucumber sauce".
He ate in the nearly-cold living room, wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely out of touch with reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example by his eating habits.
The book says that Roosevelt hired a domestic servant who did not know how to cook, and thus the White House became "a place where not only one of the most delicious dishes in Washington was served, but also the worst dishes were cooked".
As the nation's economy declined, much of the Depression-era cuisine disappeared.
But we continue to focus on calories and nutrition, and on the application of science in cooking, adds Mrs. Ziegelmann.
Paris says that in writing the book, they gained a greater understanding of Mrs. Ziegler's mother's eating habits, such as why she couldn't throw out her food.
"She was really afraid to throw the food out", said Mr. Kou.
Mrs. Ziegman said, "She really was a troublemaker".
There was an incident with a wind cake.
While we were eating at the Eisenberg Diner, the writer couple pulled out of their bag a homemade dessert: a plum pudding that President Roosevelt used to eat for lunch.
"It's the dust of the feathers", said Mrs Ziegelmanes, adding that it was common practice at the time to give the name of the chick to pious dishes.
It contains no powder, only dried plums, a little flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
All the carrot sticks were impatiently dipped in the brown mass on the shelves.
Surprisingly, it wasn't that bad.
Mr. Kou ate some more kummos.
"A piece of the pie would make a stick", he told his wife, sounding like an experienced "economist".
Gilead will receive a refund for the legal costs of its fight with Merck over the Hepatitis C patent
The Circuit Judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to recover the costs of the legal services it has provided in a Hepatitis C patent infringement case against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted of a £200 million fine for infringing two Merck patents that threatened it in connection with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets, after a US federal judge found Merck's conduct to be misconduct, such as lying on oath and other unethical conduct.
In the case on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Betsy Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to recover any legal costs it incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to gain market share against Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that are 90% effective in liver disease.
The case was initiated back in 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other to try to gain ownership of the newly developed active ingredient sofosbuvir, which is the main ingredient in Gilead's medicines.
US-backed forces claim to have taken full control of Manbij from Islamic State.
US-backed forces have taken full control of the northern city of Manbij on the Turkish border and the last Islamic State fighters have left the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are currently clearing the city of the last remaining enemy fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have released more than 2,000 hostage-taken civilians, Sharfan Darvish of the SDS-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"We are now in full control of the city and we are looking for fighters", he told Reuters.
Clinton's income in 2015 was $10.75 million, and the couple paid 34.2 percent in federal income tax.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns on Thursday, showing that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband have earned $10.75 million this year, and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million, mostly to their Clinton charity, former President Bill Clinton earned about $5.3 million as a spokesperson, and former Secretary of State received $3 million in income from her State Department work, published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton's campaign ally, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife, Anna Holtone, have released their tax returns for the past 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20,3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Keynes continue to set new standards for financial transparency", said Jennifer Palmieri, a Clinton campaign partner, in a statement released by the White House.
Donald Trump, on the other hand, is hiding behind all sorts of excuses and excuses to avoid having to fulfill his promises to disclose his tax returns.
Disclosure of tax returns is a well-documented practice for presidential candidates, but it is not required by law.
New York businessman Tramp and his lawyers cite the IRS audit as the reason for not disclosing tax information.
"You're welcome", tweeted Clinton campaign partner Ian Sams, who was on the Democratic ticket, about the tax information.
Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to release tax information until the audit is completed.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other Republicans, argue that his resignation raises questions about the true size of his estate, the amount of his donations, and his other business ties, including his ties to Russia.
Clinton added fuel to the fire by releasing a video on Friday in which several influential Republicans are asking Trump to release his tax returns.
She came back to this issue again during an economic speech Thursday in Michigan.
She told the crowd: "He refuses to do what other presidential candidates have done for decades".
Politico reports that Trump paid little or no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a writer for Friday's New York Times business column said that many accountants and lawyers think nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are a major issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, backing a proposal by billionaire Warren Buffett, is promoting the idea that anyone earning more than $1 million a year should be taxed at least 30%.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, during a Clinton speech in Omaha, Nebraska, home of his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, Buffett called on Trump to exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he's also being audited by the IRS and that Trump is afraid of the voters, not the IRS.
The Clinton campaign has released tax information going back to 2007.
Now living in Chappaqua, New York, Clinton has paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent and a total tax rate of about 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
Clinton's 2015 tax returns show that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which Clinton received $109,000 in dividends.

Jewish film director criticizes hotel in Berlin for turning off Israel's remote code at the request of an Arab - RT News
A French Jewish film director has taken to social media to find that the Israeli remote code is not available at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, citing a request from the hotel's staff to Arab customers.
The director of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, Claude Lanzmann, has not hidden his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin and has written an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During a recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find the Israeli long-distance code on a list offered by the hotel.
However, this country was not listed on the direct-telephone list.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel is being locked up and destroyed?
It's by Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol Hotel offers to call the country through its call centre.
The director asked the hotel staff for an explanation.
Lanzmann writes that the response "shocked him".
The hotel manager explained that "this is a conscious decision by the management of the hotel".
The director was even more disturbed by the reason for the removal of the code.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they demanded the Israeli code be deleted", Lanzmann quoted a hotel employee as saying.
The Suddeutsche Zeitung reports that Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, has called the case "a great disgrace".
We are shocked and surprised by this incident.
That's a shame in itself.
The fact that this is happening in Germany, and in this particular hotel chain, is an even greater humiliation.
No need to explain.
The amateur commented: "We hope the hotel will draw the right conclusions".
The incident received a fairly large amount of online coverage, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski Hotel was simply a place for Arab customers.
Another entry said "look out", indicating that the hotel is located on Kurfurstendamm Street next to the synagogue.
Der Spiegel reports that the hotel itself quickly denied any wrongdoing, saying it was all a "misunderstanding" and apologizing to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of countries", quotes Suddeutsche Zeitung the representative of Kempinski.
And he says the code is back on the list.
Police use rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
A clash between students and police occurred Thursday in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, where students gathered in a demonstration against the government's reform of the education system.
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas against the students.
The trouble began when law enforcement officers tried to force the students out, which led to police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students joined the demonstration to express their displeasure with the education reforms.
The proposal of São Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin envisages the closure of almost 100 public schools and the transfer of 300,000 students to other schools in order to save funds.
Some protesters painted graffiti against interim president Michael Temikular.
The protest came just days after a previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations in support of ousted President Dilma Rousseff, whose impeachment was voted down by the Senate.
Scott Cullum Skinners finishes first, bringing Britain the gold medal in the cycling
Kelum Skinner of Scotland finished first in the men's team sprint at the Rio Velodrome last night, while the British team defended their championship title, won at the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow played a key role in the race, making a proud and legendary shot at Sir Chris Howe and scoring the victory for the favourites, New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won a surprise victory when Hoys won the fifth of her six Olympic gold medals.
And they did it again at the World Championships in London, even though Howe had already finished his athletic career.
The problem was that the stage between Beijing and London was filled by the experienced starters Jamie Staff.
They got it at the last minute.
When Howe left, his place was being filled by Kians Emadi and Matt Crampton.
The British coaches put their hopes in Skinner, seeing his potential, which he later proved.
Hindes, Ken, the champions who started four years ago with Hoyo and Skinner, who set an Olympic qualifying record, but the best start of the race was for the New Zealand team
But the British trio won the gold medal.
The Hinds were tight after their round, with Kenny leading and Skiners holding the lead.
The change in strategy played a major role in the victory, as Hindes drove with more power to allow Kenny and especially Skinner to drive faster.
Howe was watching the race as a BBC correspondent and caught the eyes of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed onto the podium.
"It was an incredible honor", said the 23-year-old guard.
I'm doing everything I can to protect my name.
In the end, we set an Olympic record and won the World Championships.
It was just incredible.
There is no better victory.
After winning with Kenya and Howie at the 2012 London Olympics, Hindes admitted that she had deliberately crashed onto the track after a poor start.
He later refuted this comment, and British competitors were not necessarily able to prove otherwise.
This time, there was no such incident.
Hindes said: "The British flags in the stands were reminiscent of London".
In the last three months, we've become a tight-knit team.
We've lost so many World Championships, so winning the Olympics was really special.
One medal will be awarded to the country that won seven of the ten gold medals in cycling in Beijing and London.
If this is the progress of the team over the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
Given Kenya's performance, he could indeed repeat Hoya's success, winning three Olympic gold medals.
Kenya has won six gold medals and one silver, and Kenya was born on March 23 (which seems to be a British holiday, as Steve Regreiv, Mo Farah and Roger Banister were born on the same day).
This is also the date Hoey was born.
The next Kenyan race is a sprint that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
A 28-year-old athlete from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying it now.
Team trips are always the best.
Because then you can win with your teammates.
To be honest, winning by yourself is a bit of a loner".
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be promoted to the ranks".
It was the only medal fight that day, but it wasn't the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steve Burks and Owen Doulls have the fastest qualifying time in the four-mile race.
His time was 3:51.943
The world record, set in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final will be held later today, with Wiggin sure to be the center of attention.
Yesterday before the qualifying, he had a disagreement with the police when the judges called him to measure his height.
In the women's race, which continues today, Laura Trota, Joanna Rovsel Sanda, Elinora Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavy set a new course record of 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team will hopefully win a medal in the Olympic Games in the middle of the season.
After the outstanding and impressive performances in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same results in Rio.
The team has gone through a number of changes since then, including allegations of sexism and defamation, the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton, and the retirement of Hoys and Victoria Bendleton.
But as the first races of the velodrome begin, it seems that Britain will, as always, reach the top of the podium at the right time.
The future of Portland's estate is in doubt, as a lucrative contract is being terminated.
The future of the aluminum smelter and hundreds of its workers in Portland, Victoria, is in doubt as its main client, an energy company, announces its withdrawal.
This announcement is based on the Victorian Government's plans to stop subsidising the energy company, which is vital for the company to continue operating.
The 20-year-old subsidies will end in November.
As a result, more than 2000 jobs at Alcoa's Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2000 direct and indirect jobs could be at risk.
And it will also have unpredictable side effects, because the boiler uses about 10 percent of all Victoria's electricity.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the English Power Station.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is operating at a loss and may be shutting down.
These events led to years of speculation about the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of production at the plant.
The plant's energy supplier, AGL, which supplies energy from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latroube Valley, says that the other three owners are likely to terminate their contracts as well.
The majority of the power plant is owned by the joint venture of Alcoa and Alumia, with additional shares held by Chinese holding companies CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp.
'AGL hopes for the continuation of the operation of the Portland plant, which would mean a further supply of energy to the plant,' its spokesman said.
The Commission has also received comments from the GOC and the GOC.
The contracts have a validity period of 12 months and will therefore be in force until 2017.
AGL plans to continue to receive revenue from these contracts in fiscal 2017', said the company's spokesperson.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet provided any evidence that the measures are in line with the requirements of the 2014 Guidelines.
AGL claims that it has already included in its forecasts losses of USD 187 million, assuming that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa notes that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa's ability to continue operating the slaughterhouse or to supply it with energy.
The US company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 but that it would be terminated in November, without giving any explanation for why it would terminate.
Analysts have expressed concern about both the possible closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the industry's weak economy.
Steven Mickelson, the chief executive of the AGL, said last week that analysts estimated that Portland consumed 600 megawatts and Tomago 900 megawatts of energy in a year.
If both of these plants were to leave the energy market, energy demand would be significantly reduced.
And that wouldn't be good.
The Community Legal Centre rejects 160 000 people every year.
More than 160 000 people are denied their claims every year, and the situation could get worse as the budget is reduced.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who lack the means to fight illegal eviction - are denied free legal aid and representation.
The Community Legal Centre, already overwhelmed, warns that the situation will only get worse as funding is reduced.
From June next year, these law centres will receive 30% less funding than they currently receive.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Law Centre, said that the latest report by the National Law Centre Association shows that legal aid is being denied to thousands of people who need it.
Mr. Farrell said that if this decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
He also says: "The Queensland Legal Centre is constantly underfunded, which means that aid is being withheld from thousands of people who need it".
People who are trying to end abusive relationships, people with deep debts, families going through divorce, workers being unfairly fired - all of these people have legal problems and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, meaning that thousands more Queenslanders will have to solve their complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately stop funding cuts so that people who need legal help can get it.
Last year the government revealed its plans to bring legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to also address the needs of the local community and its customers and for the Palacký Government to invest in this important area.
Donald Trump's campaign is sued for employee's gun-wielding
New York: Donald Trump's campaign organizers are being sued for failing to act on information that their North Carolina operations manager turned a gun on an employee when they were in a car together in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Charlotte County by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign programmer.
Bordini said he's been waiting for months for this to go to an internal review, but you realize it's not going to happen.
Chief Earl Phillips "took out his pistol, put his right index finger on the heel and turned the stoop against Vincent's kneecap", Bordini claims in his complaint.
He also claims that by filing complaints with the local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same thing.
"The gunmen do not have to shoot to cause damage", wrote Bordini in his complaint.
Just two days before this case was filed, the Republican presidential candidate caused a stir by announcing that the "People of the Second Amendment", gun owners and enthusiasts, would take action if his daughter Hillary Clinton and her elected judges won the election.
Trump's campaign said that the media had taken his words out of context, and he never referred to violence.
Bordini's claim is seeking compensation from the campaign organizers for negligent surveillance, and from Philips for assault, illegal use of weapons and emotional distress.
Trump's spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, did not immediately comment.
I haven't been able to reach Phillips.
WCCB - Charlotte's local news agency reports that Phillips recently left the campaign.
I also couldn't get through to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been running a controversial campaign.
The case is Bordini v. the campaign committee of Donald J. Trump For President Inc. 16-CS-14300, General Court, High Court Chamber of Mecklenburg, Charlotte.
A new tradition - a village and sports festival in Kultskia.
On the first Saturday in October, the people gathered for a village and sports festival.
After ten years of celebration, it was decided that the Ezra Festival would not be held again.
The new page is now open.
The day began with a sports competition.
This time, the games were not traditional and were not taken too seriously, for example, the shooters had to shoot at a lying target, the shooter was flying, the left hand was used for throwing, and "bumping" was not part of any Olympic Games.
However, each participant was able to demonstrate his strength, courage, agility, and tact.
After the games, everyone gathered at the leisure fair, where the family festivities began.
At the same time, a "baby pool" was being set up, where children could play in the inflatable attractions and get a new image in the makeup department.
What might also become a tradition was a car show featuring both tractors and motorcycles.
The chairman of the Kulciema district administration, Inga Kadiķe-Skadiņa, spoke to everyone. She observed a good rest and dry weather, but the rain was still pouring, but it did not disturb anyone.
The celebrations continued with the welcoming of the youngest residents of Kulciema.
It's good to see the family line up with five girls and a boy.
The audience was delighted with the performances of the senior dance group "Rudens rytmi", the performance of the dance group "Redas" and the performance of the young dancers "Zelta perles".
And it's no big deal that on the stage, some people would slip.
Of course, the locals and the villagers were delighted by the famous actor duo of John Jaran and Dainis Porgants, who again played Mildyna Nabina and Skaidrīte Kraniņa, as well as the attractive wife of Berzciem from the fishing village "Dieniņas".
The ball was played by the Brujas.
Britain must preserve the Olympic spirit and expand the Heathrow.
Heathrow is not only driving prosperity and growth in the regions and in London, but also across the country.
And that, I think, is what makes Heathrow very attractive, just like in London in 2012, where we did a huge job of making all the regions of the country beneficiaries of the Olympic Games.
Stratford and Eastendendon got a lot out of the Olympics.
And we will do it again by providing local residents and businesses with business opportunities close to Heathrow.
In the local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new business opportunities, 40,000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment in the Heathrow area.
As with the London 2012 Olympics, there will be those who will say that the challenge is too great and that Heathrow's expansion is too ambitious.
People said at the time that Britain would never be ready in time for the Olympics and that it would be a world-wide failure.
The skeptics were wrong about 2012, and they won't be right about Hitrov either.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympic Games, the Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits the whole community, not just individuals.
The expansion has the potential to create up to 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating a new ground for both jobs and experience at this airport and across the UK.
Heathrow has a great team that has created an 11 billion pound infrastructure investment program on time and on budget, starting with Terminal 5, which was named the best airport terminal in the world for five years, and ending with Terminal 2, which is built between two of the busiest runways in the world.
Now they're ready to build a third runway, which will be funded by private investment of 16 billion pounds.
The London 2012 Olympic Games were a great success, and I'm sure the Heathrow expansion will be too.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our commercial future and creating a new employment environment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is a member of Heathrow's board and former Secretary of Commerce for the Department of the Treasury.
In Switzerland, a woman attempts suicide by jumping off a highway.
Hundreds are stranded on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are trying to find witnesses to an accident that occurred early Thursday morning when she was run over by a number of cars on the highway.
The accident occurred shortly after midnight on Thursday on the A1 near the town of Morges in the canton of Vaud.
The police report in the canton of Va said that in a desperate attempt to commit suicide, the woman was thrown into the darkness of the road, where she was hit by several cars.
In an apparent suicide attempt, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss man, crashed several vehicles, including a heavy-duty truck.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the crash have already testified, but others involved have yet to be identified, police said, calling on drivers involved and witnesses to recant.
A criminal investigation has also been opened in the case, which is the logical step in this case, lawyer Gilles Hofsteller told Le Tribune de Genève.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Could the collision have been avoided?
Hofsteller adds: "The prosecutor will find out what it is".
Two similar cases over the past five years indicate that none of the drivers will be held accountable.
In both cases, the pedestrian had left the highway in the middle of the night, so it was determined that the motorists could not anticipate that the pedestrian would be on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reported.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of manslaughter after she stabbed a man who was sleeping on the A1 near Paijernes in the middle of the night in August 2014.
The court found that the 22-year-old victim had been drinking and later fell asleep on the road.
The court concluded that the police officer who was on her way to the scene of the accident was driving in an appropriate manner, and the judge recognized that the man lying on the road was "a completely unforeseen and extraordinary occurrence".
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges is asked to contact police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Collect signatures online for the call for a new CIO.
A petition on the portal "Avaaz.org" has started to collect signatures for the new competition for the post of head of the State Revenue Service (VID).
In a petition to the ministers of the National Alliance (NA) and the Union of Greens and Farmers (ZZS), the public wants a transparent and professional process for the appointment of officials.
The petition was created on August 10th and currently has 55 signatures.
The process of nominating Ms Ingas Koļegova as Director-General of the ODIHR is opaque and unprofessional.
It is a reminder of the best traditions of Soviet Union officials.
This discredits the government and once again puts public trust in government and politicians.
"A competition with clear criteria against which all candidates must be evaluated is needed", the petition reads.
Its author, Mr. B. has indicated that the public is not aware of the criteria used to select Ms. Koleegova for the post.
It is also unclear what kind of candidates will be recruited by the SME.
The petition states that the State Chancellery should create a new open competition, in which professional candidates are actively recruited, recruited personnel specialists and offered a suitable remuneration.
Finance Minister Dana Reiznieces-Ozola officially nominated Kolegov for the post of head of the Central Bank last week, and the government was supposed to confirm him in the new post this week, but all the Unity party ministers voted against it, so the issue was postponed for a week.
If we lost, then I played badly.
The team of volleyball players Aleksandrs Samoilov and Janis Šmēdiņš had hoped to win a medal at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, but after missing the competition, Samoilov decided to withdraw from the tournament.
One of the world's strongest beach volleyball pairs lost to Brazil's Evandro Gonsalves Oliveira and Pedro Solberg Salgado in the final and deciding match of the subgroup tournament on Thursday, losing 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) to end their four-year participation in the most important sporting forum.
In the three subgroup matches, Latvian athletes won one victory, but the same ratio was two more pairs.
The ratio of the three pairs' minimum points was then calculated, which was the most unfavourable for the Latvian duo after the decisive loss suffered in this match.
"We led the first set, but we were still 16 points behind at 4:15", Smidnysh recalled.
I don't even know how we got out of the points in the rest of the set.
That's not how you play.
Then, in the second set, everything was fine, and at the end of the set, the game was broken, and it had to be a good basis for the third set as well.
We started out the same, but then when we combined the sides, the score only increased for one team.
We made too many mistakes in the attack.
In the group stage, all the teams were equal, almost all matches were three sets, so small points were important.
"We could have played more evenly, instead of giving up three or four points in a row", said the athlete.
We knew Evander was a sight.
"We were able to get through the first set, scored 1-2 points in the second, but he lost the game in the third at +4", Šmēdņš recalled.
We tried to show the best game.
Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.
I didn't look at the scoreboard before the game, but I knew I needed to get as few points as possible.
"If we lose, then I have played badly", Samoilov said.
Evandro was expected to serve well and we did quite well in the first set, but in the third he was open and it was difficult to build an attack.
I made a lot of mistakes in my hiring, especially with Peter's servants, but I had to deal with that.
Samoilov said that unlike the previous match, today's athletes were not nervous.
"We walked, we played, we had a defense, but we needed a better serve", the athlete said.
"They played well and ended up going for the 'urrra'".
We said right before the tournament that the stakes were the lowest they could be.
We had a chance to fight for the top spot, but we didn't even get out of the group.
"Everyone expected us to win a medal and we expected ourselves to win a medal, but after that it's no longer the difference between 25th and 4th", said Samoilov, who predicted the duo would continue to play together in the future.
I think it's okay, and we'll keep playing together because it's just one tournament.
Samoilov was already in his third Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, as in 2008 in Beijing he started together with Martyn Plyvajn, but four years ago in London he played together with Ruslan Sorokin.
Meanwhile, for Shemay, this was his second start in the Olympics.
Latvenergo is also following the process of opening the gas market from a potential trader position.
The state energy company Latvenergo is following the process of opening the gas market both from the consumer and potential trader's positions, said the company's press secretary Ivita Bidere.
'The decision whether Latvenergo will also join the gas market as a trader in the future will be determined by the gas market model and the legal framework that will be created.'
"We are therefore actively involved in the development and commenting of legislation and in the submission of our proposals", said Ms Bidere.
The agency BNS has already written that the Ministry of Economy (EM) in cooperation with the Public Service Regulatory Commission and the energy company "Latvijas Gāze" has developed a draft Cabinet regulation "Regulations for the sale and use of natural gas" that will change the existing principles of the natural gas market operation, from 3 April 2017, providing natural gas users with the right to freely choose a natural gas trader.
In working towards the new regulation of the natural gas market, the EM aims to make the process of natural gas trading as simple and user-friendly as possible.
The most efficient and user-friendly service solution was therefore the 'dealer-centric model' in which all customer service activities are provided by the distributor - one contract, one invoice and one information and customer service point, leaving the technical aspects of the natural gas distribution system to the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in electricity trading.
It is recalled that the market opening to household customers is intended to be gradual, i.e. after 3 April 2017 household customers who do not wish to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue to receive natural gas from an existing trader at regulated price, thus becoming connected customers.
'In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to related users at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader', the Ministry informed.
Traders will have to choose a natural gas trader with whom to conclude a natural gas trading contract.
For a certain period of time until the conclusion of the gas trading contract, traders will be supplied with natural gas at a fixed price by the existing natural gas trader.
The draft rules of the Cabinet detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas distributor, system operator and user.
The rules shall specify the procedures for the supply of natural gas to users and its interruption, the requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of the trader, the public marketer, the system operator, the user and the owner of the gasified facility in the supply and use of natural gas; the procedures for settling the services received, the interest rate for delay, the change of traders and the procedures for supplying users in the event of a disruption in the supply of natural gas; the procedures for ensuring the provision of a public market to users connected to the supply of natural gas.

However, a light car crashed on the corner of Barona and Dzirnava.
Minister: A hearing is scheduled next week on the increase in the Director General's salary.
Finance Minister Dana Reiznice-Ozola (Union of Greens and Farmers (ZZS)) plans to talk with Prime Minister Mari Kuczynski (ZZS) and the government coalition partners next week about increasing the salary of the Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID).
Reizniece-Ozola told reporters on Friday that the issue of raising the salary of the CEO needed to be resolved urgently to make the post more attractive to potential candidates for the re-call.
There's also a meeting next week to discuss a change in the terms of the tender.
The Minister also stressed that she had no specific candidate in her mind to be considered for the vacant post.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola rejected the view that the head of the State Environment Agency, Inga Kolegova, would have been a good director general of the UN.
As regards the current acting head of the OLAF, Ms Daci Pelēko, who has expressed her willingness to run for the post, the Minister reiterated the view that the new Director-General of the OLAF should be 'looked at from the side' and not come from within the OLAF structure.
The Commission also stressed that it was waiting for the Saeima to return from its holiday period in order to implement as soon as possible the amendments to the law necessary for the reorganisation of the OAU.
The BNS has already informed that the head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Koļegova, has submitted to the Minister of Finance, Dana Reizniece-Ozola (ZZS), a request to withdraw her candidacy for the post of Director General of the Environmental Service.
In her filing, she said it was not an easy choice, but that her family had been under severe emotional strain for the past two weeks, despite not committing any criminal offenses.
Kolejkov also noted that the consideration of her candidacy has led to increasing disagreements between the parties of the ruling coalition, which is also unacceptable.
It is also reported that the previous Director-General of the ILO, Inara Petersson, left office at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; stock market indices in the United States and Europe are rising, as is the value of the U.S. dollar.
Oil prices continued to rise on Friday morning, boosting investor sentiment after Saudi Arabia's oil minister raised hopes that the world's top producers would meet in September to stabilize the world's oil market.
The three major US stock market indexes on Thursday reached a record high, not seen since 1999.
The main positive factors in the market were the rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several large companies.
The rise in oil prices and strong financial performance by several companies also led European stock indices to rise on Thursday.
The US dollar appreciated against the euro, against the British pound and against the Japanese yen on Thursday.
The price of crude oil on the WTI exchange in New York rose by $1.78 to $43.49 a barrel on Thursday.
The price of Brent crude oil for October deliveries rose by $1.99 on the London Stock Exchange to $46.04 a barrel.
The turnover of the canning company "Blue Lagoon" fell by 33,8% last year.
The turnover of the canning company "Zilā lagūna" last year was 4,202 million euros, which is 33.8% less than a year earlier, while the company's losses decreased by 5.7 times - to 904.7 thousand euros, according to the annual financial statements published in the database "Lursoft".
The management report states that the company operated at a loss in 2015 for a number of reasons, including a persistent lack of working capital caused by the exit of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market, the termination of a previously existing credit line, and leaving the Blue Lagoon with contracts that could not be fulfilled.
Consequently, the company did not have sufficient funds to purchase cheaper raw materials in large volumes and receive volume discounts.
The withdrawal of the bank from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing projects supported by the European Union Structural Funds, which would have allowed the plant to purchase new production equipment and modernise the infrastructure.
The financial performance of the company was also affected by the increase in the price of raw materials and the unwillingness of customers to pay more for the goods produced by the company during the previous year.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not provided any information on the costs of the sale of the assets of the company.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any information on the amount of the aid to be recovered.
The investors have already visited the company's largest creditor, Unicredit Leasing, where the parties have met and discussed possible investment plans.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any evidence that the aid granted to the company was compatible with the functioning of the EEA Agreement.
This plan included the improvement and optimisation of technological processes, which allowed for greater production productivity and capacity.
'Several machines have been purchased to increase the production rate,' the company's management said.
The management of Blue Lagoon notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company's plant to fulfil orders that were not possible before.
The first production batch to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
As the protocols of intent for the sale of the product have already been signed, all production will be sold in accordance with the protocols of intent.
The new product would increase sales by around EUR 300 000 per month", says the company's management.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement for the supply of fish products to Iraq in August 2016.
Blue Lagoon has shipped its first experimental container to Israel in 2016, expanded its market to Cyprus and will sign a partnership agreement with a new supermarket chain in the US this September.
As a result of all the above measures, the company intends to increase its turnover.
The Commission considers that the aid granted to the company is compatible with the internal market.
The 'Blue Lagoon' was founded in 1997 and has a registered capital of EUR 1,156 million.
The company is owned by two private Latvian individuals - Mihailam Kaidanov (89,11%) and Igor Shirshom (10,89%).

Riga can be considered the city of the beginning of the career and inspiration of the goddess of cinema, Zara Leander.
Zara Leander's visit to her great-aunt, Ruth, who was the mistress of the Swedish ambassador to Latvia, in Riga in 1924 turned out to be fateful, because it was she who discovered the unusual low-cut contralto for Zara Leander's wife, which she applied when she made her debut on the stage of the Riga cabaret theatre.
Perhaps it was the accidental arrival of the Lido that became the fatal turning point in Zara's creative journey towards world fame.
The memory of the Riga Fair was warm, and she had hoped to travel to Riga by train, but unfortunately, these hopes were not fulfilled, because the Second World War began.
Using the form of the play, this meeting will be possible at the Riga Festival 2016 and the role of the great Zara Leanderes will be played by the magnificent Ieva Kerēvica.
There are extensive traffic restrictions in the Aglon area.
To ensure the safety of the participants of the Feast of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, from August 12 at 17:00 to August 15 at 18:00 the transit traffic of trucks will be closed on several state highways in the Aglona district, informed the Latvian State Roads.
Participants in the Aglonas and public transport will not be affected by these restrictions.
It should be noted that the construction work is underway on the P62 Krăşlava-Preiļi-Madona motorway from Krăşlava to Krăşlava station (0.80.-4.00 km) and that only public transport and pedestrians will be able to cross the construction site during the Aglona festival.
Other road users will be provided with a bypass road - diagram attached.
Traditionally, these festivals draw large numbers of participants, including pilgrims.
Therefore, motorists should be particularly careful as there will be heavy pedestrian traffic on various motorway routes in the direction of Aglon.
We urge drivers to be aware of the traffic restrictions, to respect the traffic organisation's procedures and to take account of the possible longer time spent on the road.
Water temperature in all water bodies has dropped below +20 degrees.
The water temperature continues to drop during the winter, and currently it is below +20 degrees in all rivers and lakes, as well as in the sea, according to the data of the Latvian Environmental, Geological and Meteorological Center.
The water temperature in the sea is cooling down to +16..+18 degrees, the water temperature on the west coast of the Gulf of Riga has dropped to +13 degrees due to wind, in Roja up to +9 degrees.
The water temperature in the Grand River and the Danube, as well as the Great Lakes, is +18..+20 degrees, in other bodies of water +14..+19 degrees.
The water temperature in the rivers and lakes reached +24..+25 degrees in places before the year, up to +22 degrees warm water on the southern coast of the Gulf of Riga.
Russian army plane identified near the border with Latvia.
A Russian army plane has been identified near the Latvian border, the BNS news agency has learned from the National Armed Forces.
The NBS informs that on Friday patrol aircraft over the neutral waters of the Baltic Sea near the border of the territorial sea of Latvia identified the Russian armed forces aircraft "IL-20".
The BNS agency has already reported on several occasions that Russian army planes and naval vessels are regularly spotted near the borders of Latvia.
There was a sexual assault of two children in an amusement park in England.
Police in Berkshire, England, are searching for a man who sexually abused two six-year-old girls at a theme park in Legoland, reports the Daily Mail.
Police have asked parents to examine the photos taken at the amusement park because they may show an intruder.
The girls told their parents about what had happened.
The man was unknown to the girls, white in color, and about 20 years old.
Kurdish activists occupy the building of the German public broadcasting organization.
A group of 30 Kurds stormed the WDR public broadcasting building in Düsseldorf on Thursday night, staging a nearly two-hour protest, German police said.
The protesters, who arrived with placards, chanted various slogans in an attempt to draw attention to the current situation in Turkey.
Officials say the demonstration was peaceful overall and the protesters eventually left the building voluntarily at the request of workers.
The insurer pays compensation to passengers whose flight was cancelled at the airport on Wednesday.
If insurance paid travel insurance compensation to a family for a cancelled flight from Riga Airport on Wednesday 10 August, which meant that they had to cancel their planned visit to the music festival.
August 11th If Insurance received a claim from a customer.
The family had planned to go to a music festival in Belgium, but because the flight was cancelled at the airport on Wednesday, the customer was charged a fee for the reservation of accommodation that could no longer be cancelled, as well as for the tickets purchased for the festival, amounting to EUR 204.
The airline has promised to reimburse the customers for the money spent on the airline tickets.
If Insurance has paid compensation for interruption or cancellation of the trip in an average of 15% of all travel insurance claims.
"In these cases, the costs of ticket purchase, return or exchange, as well as the cost of accommodation reservation, are reimbursed", explains Dagni Rutka, Head of the Insurance Risk Product for Individuals at If.
The Commission has also received information from the United Kingdom that the air carrier Ryanair is planning to operate from the airport in the region of Nîmes.
A man is forced to leave his home because of a neighbor's house being repaired.
Dmitry Saidiashov, whose neighbor began a major renovation of his apartment, has been interviewed on LTV's "Studio 4" and since then Dmitry has been afraid of the roofs and is not sure that it is safe to stay in the apartment.
The problem is that my neighbors have been building things that are not right, and my apartment has damaged roofs.
I then informed the Riga Building Authority, the building supervisor, and other agencies.
The building manager said we're not an operational service and we don't have an expert.
"The owner of the apartment has to go to the Latvian Union of Engineers, and there will be an expert", says Dmitrijs.
An expert came in, recorded what had happened, and found the search unsatisfactory.
But it's been a month since Dmitri's first application to the construction board, and until this week, no one had been able to answer whether or not staying in the apartment was life-threatening.
The building manager said, "That's the law, wait, if you're not satisfied, write to everyone in turn".
"I wrote to the Riga City Hall, but they sent it to the building manager, then the manager sent it back to the construction company, and then the road was closed", says Dmitry.
After examining all the paperwork, it is clear that the construction work has been stopped, although at any moment you can hear someone working there.
An expert's report is due within two months, and the owner of the apartment, who is carrying out the repairs, must eliminate all these defects within six months.
The independent expert has provided an opinion, which the works council considers to be incomplete and superficial.
The expert did not indicate whether the metal barrier in this load-bearing structure was broken, and therefore it is not certain that the owner of the lower apartment is in danger.
"We have therefore requested additional explanations from this expert", says Ilze Žūka, a representative of the Riga City Construction Board.
Despite the ban on any renovation of the upper apartment, it is still heard from there that the construction is continuing.
The penalty for unlicensed construction is between EUR 70 and 700 but in a particular case the penalty can be much higher.
While awaiting the expert's opinion, the construction board decided that both the apartment building and Dmitri's apartment should not be used.
"This is an unusual case in the practice of the construction authority, whereby the residents, through their ignorance or simple unwillingness, may have endangered not only their property but also the owner of the lower property, as a result of which the owner cannot exploit his property", says the representative of the construction authority.
Now Dmitry has to find another place to live - with friends, in a hotel, or in a rented apartment.
But Dmitry may be able to recover damages from his neighbor through civil law, which can take a very long time.
Due to the construction of the property, it is currently forbidden to stay in both apartments until the architect gives his approval, and this may take up to three weeks.
The owner of the apartment where the repairs were made will have to pay for the damage.
The owner of this apartment is also facing a prison term of up to six months for not complying with the building authorities.
You're not going to believe this.
How many lawns are there in this picture?
The correct answer is five.
Five white lambs were born in the Demidova Zoo, near Kiev, Ukraine.
All are well and sometimes even feed the young, despite the fact that the young are fed by the common.
The conversion of the former Kemer Sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost 22 million euros.
The conversion of the former Kemeri sanatorium into the five-star Park Hotel Kemeri will cost 22 million euros, Gita Želve, a representative of the future hotel manager SIA Park Hotel Kemeri, told LETA.
The establishment of the hotel is the first stage of the renovation of Kemmer's former sanatorium.
The second phase will be a wellness clinic, scheduled to open in 2022, while the hotel is scheduled to open in May 2018.
Želve notes that the exact cost of the clinic is not yet known.
But she notes that it will be located in the former Kemmerer Court Polyclinic, a building of some 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be located on three floors.
Park Hotel Chemeri and the proposed clinic are owned by the international fund G Capital Europe, which invests in European assets.
G Capital Europe is owned by several investors who invest in the fund, Želve notes.
As previously stated by George Jones, Managing Director of G Capital Europe, the former resort polyclinic is expected to cost between EUR 12 and 15 million, with a total investment of over EUR 30 million.
It is already known that the City of Jurmala plans to raise EUR 14,5 million from European Union funds for the restoration of a cultural-historical park of more than 42 hectares, the restoration of access roads and street sections, the construction of an interactive nature tourism object, the improvement of the area and the construction of a car park on Emila Darzynska Street, which will promote the socio-economic development of the city of Jurmala and the increase in the number of tourists.
The design work is scheduled for mid-2017 and construction and cleaning work will start in the autumn of the following year.
It is reported that the historic sanatorium complex "Khemeri" is planned to be a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Kemeri" and a "wellness" clinic.
However, the reconstruction was delayed.
On the other hand, the 2010 report stated that Ominasis, in regular communication with the hotel operator Kempinski, which continues to provide daily technical control at the Kemperi sanatorium, would certainly have 'the reconstruction of the future Kempinski hotel completed' in 2011 and immediately begin the preparatory work for the opening of the Kempinski hotel chain.
In October 2014, Park Hotel Kemieri confirmed its willingness to purchase the assets of the bankrupt Ominasis Latvia in an auction, but a month later the auction was declared void as the winner had not paid for the purchase within the set time.
The sale price was set at the starting price of EUR 2,86 million in the last non-existent auction.
As reported to the agency by Ieva Aile, a representative of the city council, the municipality, by signing the protocol, confirmed that with the help of the European Union's structural funds, it would rebuild the historic Kemeri Park, create an interactive nature tourism site, and build roads and car parks.
President Antonenko will present the three stars to the operative.
The President of the Republic, Raymond Vejonis, will present the Order of the Three Stars to the 3rd class of the Order of the Serpent, Alexander Antonenko, next week, on August 16, according to the President's agenda.
The ceremony of the Three Star Order will take place at the House of the Black Eagle at 1 p.m.
According to information provided by the Latvian National Opera and Ballet (LNOB), Antonenko graduated from the Jožepa Mediņa Music College in 1998, where he studied percussion and learned singing under Margarita Gruzdeva.
He studied at the Vocal Department of the Latvian Academy of Music under Jāzepa Vītolā in the class of Arvīda Lusta.
In 1997 he started singing in the choir of the Latvian National Opera, and in 1998 he made his debut with the role of Oberto in G.F.Hendel's opera "Alčína".
She won the "Lelo Music Award 2003" for her vocal performance in opera and Verdi in the Requiem.
It is stated that in the 2004/2005 season he became the most internationally acclaimed Latvian tenor, who is engaged by the largest opera houses in the world.
Since autumn 2004 he has sung at the "Dieseldorfer Deutsche Oper am Rhein", the Berlin and the Hellenic Opera, the Dresden Semperoper, the Royal Opera in Oslo and Stockholm, the Covent Garden Opera in London, the Monte Carlo Opera, the Vienna State Opera, as well as the Geneva, Dresden and Dieseldorfer Opera and the Salzburg Festival.
In 2009, Antonenko made his Metropolitan Opera debut in the role of Prince in "Nara" with great success.
In 2011, Antonenko sang the title role in "Otello" with Ricardo Muti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at the Paris Opera, in the Covent Garden Opera he sang in the debut of Luigi "Apmetņa" and in Stockholm he participated in the production of "Maiden from the West" by Kristof Loy.
A year later, Antonenko was given the role of Othello at the Covent Garden Opera in London, where she was a great success.
Former NATO commander Brydlov's email was hacked by Russian hackers.
The hackers who broke into the US Democratic National Committee (DNC) computers may have carried out several other cyber attacks, including breaking into the email of former NATO European Commander Philip Breedlove and the servers of George Soros' Open Society Institute, the Bloomberg Business News Agency reported on Thursday.
The hackers published the information they obtained on DCLeaks.com.
Among other things, it contains Brydlov's letters and information about the work of the Soros Institute.
The hackers had access to the institute's computers for a year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyberattacks were carried out by the same hackers affiliated with the Russian intelligence services who hacked the DNC's email.
The Wall Street Journal reports that the Obama administration is considering new sanctions against Russia in response to the DNC hack.
To enforce the sanctions, the administration will have to officially call in hackers backed by Russia or Russian agencies to attack the Democratic Party's servers.
In July, the website WikiLeaks reportedly published some 20,000 emails obtained from the DNC computer system, suggesting that Democratic Party leaders had attempted to damage the campaign of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, former rival of Hillary Clinton, in the fight for the Democratic nomination to start the presidential race.
According to US media sources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating the hack of the Democratic servers, and other US intelligence officials believe that Russia's involvement in the cyberattack is almost certain.
Yoko Ono's presence was threatening the Beatles.
Paul McCartney has admitted that Yoko Ono's presence has created a sense of threat to the legendary band The Beatles.
The 74-year-old rock star is currently in a "good" relationship with the late John Lennon's widow, but at the time of her visit to the band's recording studio, she was afraid of McCartney because Ono was the only female member of the band - George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Lennon and McCartney - among them.
When asked about their relationship, the singer told Rolling Stone magazine: "They're really good".
We felt threatened.
She was on the amp as we were recording.
Most groups couldn't take it.
We did, but not very well, because we were very nervous.
We weren't sexists, but girls didn't usually come to the studio, they let us work.
When John began to meet with Yoko, she was not in the control room, but in the middle of the four of us.
The Yellow Submarine singer also admitted that he now regularly communicates with former bandmate Ringo and occasionally confirms Apple's plans for the recording studio, but otherwise the Beatles are "finished".
Asked if he was still dating the other surviving member of the legendary rock band, McCartney told Rolling Stone magazine, "Absolutely not".
We meet at social events and parties.
But I felt a little out of it at the meetings.
I left Apple in the middle of a bad divorce.
I sent John Eastman to the meetings in my place and said, "Don't tell me what everyone says, because I can't stand sitting at that table".
It was too painful, like watching your pet die.
The company now works so I just listen to all the records.
I'm part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus was once a habitable planet
Based on NASA's latest climate models, Venus was once a habitable planet.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to study the history of Venus using tools and algorithms that climate scientists use.
The model was developed to determine whether conditions on Venus, which has a hot, water-free surface and an atmosphere composed almost entirely of carbon, had ever been similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus is due to a thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulations suggest that Venus once had a flat, Earth-like atmosphere, and that it was slowly breaking up.
The model also looks at the early topography of Venus.
It had more land area than Earth, but it had enough water and geographical diversity to support life and prevent water from evaporating.
In the early days of Venus, the Sun was 30 percent brighter.
In a GISS model simulation of the rotation of Venus, the model reveals that the light of the day on it lasts for 2 months, explained GISS scientist Antonius Del Genio in a press release.
This process heats the planet's surface and produces rain, which in turn forms thick layers of clouds that act as a rain screen, shielding the planet from the sun's heat.
The result is a temperate climate, actually a few degrees below the temperature on Earth today.
The model portrays the history of Venus, similar to the theory of evolution that scientists have developed in their hypotheses.
Though it was once habitable, for several billion years Venus was subjected to excessive heat and ultraviolet rays.
Its oceans were scorched, and its mountains were scorched by ultraviolet light.
When the water was completely evaporated, all that remained was a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide, a deadly greenhouse gas, the Venus we know today.
The scientists have published the results of their new model of the climate of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Royce resigns as coach of the Avalanche
On Thursday, Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey operations Patrick Roy filed a motion to dismiss citing inadequate influence over the team's decision-making process.
Colorado vice president and general manager Joe Sakix confirmed the news and said the club would begin looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have been energetic, passionate and dedicated in my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Hockey Club", said Royce, 50, in a statement.
This summer, I've been thinking a lot about how I could improve the performance of my team, give it the momentum it needs and get it to the next level.
To achieve this, the vision of the head coach and the vice president of hockey operations must be in full alignment with the vision of the organization.
He should also be able to influence decisions concerning the performance of the team.
At present, these conditions are not fulfilled.
Sakix, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his investment in the team.
Sakis said that Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organization, and we wish him well in the future.
In his first season with the Avalanche in 2013-14, Roy was named the league's top coach and received the Jack Adams Award.
He helped the team to 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs.
The Avalanche finished the 2015-16 season with a 39-39-4 record, five points behind the Wild, failing to earn a second special invitation from the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goaltender Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career, two with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil platform workers resume talks and strike
The workers' strike over the pay of North Sea oil rig workers has been called off as negotiations between the two sides in the dispute have resumed, according to the negotiators.
There are periodic strikes against the oil refining company Wood Group on the North Sea oil platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
The joint statement states that the Wood Group and the Unite and RMT agreed to resume negotiations to resolve the dispute.
Several full-day meetings are planned over the following week, starting early next week, with the aim of re-examining the issues.
The trade unions said their recent actions, organised after a break of more than 25 years, were aimed at a planned pay cut of 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, the Wood Group has reduced wages for its employees in the North Sea by 9 percent this year.
The company reduced the wages of the land workers by 10% in 2014.
The company explains that the additional reductions in wages would allow the company to survive the downturn in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has already reduced salaries for several thousand people and announced plans to wind down its oil and gas operations in 10 countries to streamline its workforce in preparation for a large-scale merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are feeling the pressure of falling oil prices, and the situation is further complicated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
Earlier this week, the Scottish MP, Dave Anderson, met with the workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues of the week - the plans for the North Sea strike.
He said the North Sea was vital to the economy of the region.
In his report, he explains that Northern Yuria and the state as a whole need an economy that benefits all, not individuals.
The Commission will continue to monitor the implementation of the EU's new maritime legislation and will continue to monitor the implementation of the EU's new maritime legislation.
Kepler measured the rotation rate of stars in the constellation Pleiades.
The latest mission of the Kepler telescope has helped astronomers compile the most comprehensive catalog of the rotation rates of stars in the Pleiades constellation.
The new data help astronomers understand why stars in this star rotate at different speeds, and how the rotation rate of stars can be related to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with those of other stars, we will gain a broader understanding of the relationship between the mass of the stars, their ages, and even the history of the solar system", said Luis Rebula, a scientist at the Caltech Infrared Process and Analysis Center in Pasadena, California.
The comet is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this galaxy are just beginning to grow, reaching an age of about 125 million years.
They're spinning at full speed.
At their maximum velocity, these rising stars are dispersed by a large amount of stellar wind.
When the waves enter the magnetic field of the stars, they slow the stars down.
As stars age, their rotational speed decreases.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by determining the time between the appearance of a recognizable stellar neighborhood, such as the solar plane.
The latest star rotation rate catalogue shows that larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller stars.
Rebul compares the stars to the dancers, and the taller dancers do the pirouettes slower than the shorter dancers.
Rebul says that the "ballet" of the Pleiades shows that slowly rotating objects are larger and more massive, while faster- rotating objects are very small stars.
Because of its proximity, the Pleiades star serves as a magnificent space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars with their rotational speeds.
Rebul says that Pleiades' star helps to create theoretical models of the rotation of stars in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have much to learn about how, when, and why stars slow down and stop spinning completely.
Rebuls and his colleagues have detailed their analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades in three new publications that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
