The rapidly spreading and cumulative outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The increasing outbreak of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the countries of the European Economic Area/EU and the UK confirms that while in different countries we are at different stages of the epidemic, the COVID-19 pandemic in all countries is progressing rapidly.
Based on the experience in Italy, other countries, hospitals and ICU departments should increase their preparedness for the increasing number of COVID-19 patients requiring healthcare and ICU care.
On 31 December 2019, a group of pneumonia cases with unknown cause was reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported the causative agent as a new coronavirus variant called acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date suggests that approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have a chronic disease, i.e. a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, and most of these cases recover.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% experience a critical condition requiring special care.
In-hospital mortality due to COVID-19 is around 4%.
In this study, we assess the trend of the increasing spread of the coronavirus in each of the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it with Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with those in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 has spread to more geographical areas and the dynamics of the pandemic in other parts of the world now depend on China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
Spiteri and colleagues reported the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Europe as defined by the World Health Organization in Eurosurveillance on 5 March 2020.
In the EU/EEA, three cases confirmed by France were reported on 24 January 2020 from people returning from Wuhan, Hubei, China.
On 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were identified in all 30 European/EEA and UK countries, with 39,768 confirmed cases and 1,727 deaths reported from 31 December 2019 to date, with 17,750 confirmed cases and 1,441 deaths reported from Italy alone.
By obtaining the cumulative number and cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), cases of COVID-19 in countries around the world are only reported from official sources such as the Ministry of Health, the National and Regional Health Organization and the World Health Organization at 8:00 a.m. daily.
The data were used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare it with the trend of the disease in Italy.
As an indicator for the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases over 14 days as a single indicator, and therefore the normal COVID-19 period in EU/EEA countries and the UK was taken into account for the period 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The cumulative number of cases reported from each country on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 am was also compared with the number of cases reported from Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
The trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
The 14-day trend of cumulative COVID-19 outbreaks in the EU/EEA countries and the UK is broadly based on Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
Overall, for the EU/EEA and the UK, the cumulative COVID-19 outbreak began to increase around 21 February and then sharply increased around 28 February 2020 (Supplementary Requirement).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed a similar trend of increase from the cumulative COVID-19 outbreak (supplementary claim).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to cases in Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
This figure indicates that on 15 March at 8am, the total number of cases reported in 15 other EU/EEA/UK countries and the UK is comparable to the number of cases in Italy in the 3 weeks before or less.
The results suggest that the number of diagnosed COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends observed in the cumulative COVID-19 outbreak indicate that the pandemic is currently progressing at almost equal pace in all countries.
While countries are at different stages of disease, the response of public health organizations varies, and there are likely to be different definitions and protocols in countries for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19, including increased testing speed.
In early March 2020, doctors in areas affected by the virus in Italy described a situation where around 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas were reaching their maximum capacity.
Information on the admission of COVID-19 cases to hospitals or intensive care units is currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
To complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths, this information should be collected in a systematic manner.
A study carried out in 11-2010 showed that access to intensive care and mid-care beds in Europe varies widely, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have fewer or more resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010).
Modelling scenarios for healthcare capacity saturation, with a focus on the prevalence of COVID-19 cases in hospitalised patients in the EU/EEA and UK countries in relation to the occupation of more than 90% of ICU bed capacity, are presented in the sixth update of the ECDC COVID-19 Rapid Risk Assessment.
Since cases are categorised in specific regions of the European/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and ICUs usually serve the population of a region, information on cases and ICU beds should preferably be available in the list of territorial units for Statistical Level 2 (NUTS - 2).
The Italian experience and the ongoing trends in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic in the EU/EEA and the UK is progressing rapidly.
Hospitals and ICUs therefore need to prepare for a scenario of sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring special care, such as is occurring in affected areas of Italy.
As noted in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, preventive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2 is needed, as a rapid shift from containment to mitigation approach, as predicting a rapid increase in the number of cases if not done early may leave decision-makers and hospitals with insufficient time to understand, accept and adapt based on their own response to the trend.
A rapid risk assessment lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of this pandemic.
There is little opportunity for countries to increase their control measures to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on the healthcare sector.
Failure to do so will likely leave the healthcare systems of other EU/EEA countries facing a wave of patients who will require special care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), which has so far caused more than 3,000 deaths and 80,000 infections in China and other parts of the world, has been a catastrophic event for humanity.
SARS-CoV-2 may also have been transmitted from bats, as did the similar SARS virus itself, which killed thousands in 2003, and, through a similar mechanism, induces similar symptoms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity, mortality and mortality rate than SARS, but is more transmissible, affecting older people more than young people and men more than women.
This paper, in response to the large number of published claims about this emerging disease, seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this rapidly expanding research topic.
We will cover the basic principles of epidemiology, causology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of this disease.
Although many questions still need to be answered, we hope that this review article will help to understand and eradicate this deadly disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were forced to stay at home for several weeks after the entire holiday due to the outbreak of the new viral disease.
It is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; as a result, the virus was renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 and the related disease CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to some 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported, including more than 40,000 discharged and more than 3,000 deaths.
The World Health Organization warned that COVID-19 is the number one enemy of humanity and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), since the first report on January 7, 2020, in less than two months, more than 200 articles on COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, causology, diagnosis and treatment have been published that have identified the sequence of the virus isolated from the body of a few patients.
In this review article we try to summarise the progress of research in this new and rapidly developing subject area.
Where possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and other infectious diseases caused by CoVs, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, which was discovered in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and treatment of the disease, as well as some other important questions.
CoVs have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, leading to about 15% of common colds.
But in this century, we have twice encountered highly pathogenic human CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and soon spread to many other countries with horrific rates of outbreak and mortality.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, some cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported to the National Health Commission of China from Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence spread.
On January 15, 2020, the first death from Wuhan was reported.
The simultaneous epidemic rapidly spread to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, a healthcare-specific epidemic of quadrilla therapy was reported, indicating that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, residents of Wuhan were quarantined at home and public transport was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study of the disease reported that of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered to be the origin of infection from an unknown animal source.
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency on 30 January.
As of the time of writing, the disease has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Figure 2).
As the situation is rapidly evolving, the ultimate extent and severity of the disease outbreak remains to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a study conducted at a number of centres involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 cases, showed a picture-by-picture trend from the epidemic at the following rate (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
People infected with SARS-CoV-2 have different ages, but are mainly aged 30 to 65.
Almost half of the infected (47.7%) were over 50 years of age, a very small number were under 20 years of age, and only 14 infected individuals were under 10 years of age.
Individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 are mostly male (0.31/100,000) to female (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread in different batches, mainly in and around Hubei.
The average duration of onset to diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9 days).
The median duration of the disease was 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2 days).
The average start-to-death period was 9.5 days (4.8 to 13 days).
The number of base syrups (R0) is equal to 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the R0 adjusted 2.23 to 4.82
The number of people with developmental disabilities increased before 23 January 2020, coinciding with the busy transportation period, before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate in patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the controlled mortality rate in all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 include gender (male), age (over 60 years) and severe pulmonary fibrosis.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, enveloped viruses that contain a unique strand of sensitive RNA.
These viruses can be divided into four classes: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, where the identified alpha and beta variants of the CoVs can infect humans.
The enveloped spinal glycoprotein (S) is attached to the host cell angiotensin and is converted to the positive-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the peptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and then membrane synthesis occurs.
Genome-wide viral RNA is released in the cytoplasm; after viral genome replication, genome-wide RNA forms vesicles containing the virion with enveloped glycoprotein and nucleo-oxide proteins that then attach to the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was reported on 10 January 2020.
Genetic matching of more than 99/98 percent in 10 sequence samples collected from the original site of the outbreak, the Hunan seafood market in Wuhan, determined that SARS-CoV-2 is a new variant of beta-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through examination with transition electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in the superfine tissue lining of the human airway.
It was determined that ACE2 acts as a human receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein from SARS-CoV-2 is weaker than SARS-CoV's weak binding to human ACE2 which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a modern short protein encoded by orf3b and a secretory protein encoded by orf8.
orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral reproduction disease by inhibiting IFNβ. However, orf8 has no known functional domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou and colleagues reported a human full-length ACE2 related cryo-EM structure with a resolution of 2.9 angstrem in combination with the amino acid transporter B0AT1 on February 18, 2020.
They found that this combination, which had open and closed forms, combined as a dimer and that the combination ACE2-B0AT1 could bind two S proteins together, which could be evidence for CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 may be converted into a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Medium Host and Source Builder
It has been found that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV both originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through the cats and camels, respectively.
By comparing the phylogenetic of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, it was determined that bats are the native hosts of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-like CoVs if they originate from bats SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, the question of whether an intermediate host helped the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unanswered and the route of transmission still needs further clarification.
G and colleagues believe that the worms, which contain a homologous synthesis in the S protein, have acted as carriers of the virus from bats to humans.
In a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, based on a 99 percent genetic correlation between the CoVs detected in pangolin and SARS-CoV-2 and the study, concluded that eating pangolin - a type of long-horned, feeding ant often used in traditional Chinese medicine - may have acted as a potential intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference in the two extended genomes is still a large difference; therefore we are still waiting for definitive results for strong evidence (Figure 33).
The physicochemical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV survive in dry environments for up to 48 hours and at temperatures of 20°C and humidity of 40-50% for up to 5 days under laboratory conditions.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to UV radiation and a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes, ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, plastic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents other than chlorhexidine, which can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is not immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the novel virus.
At present, no detailed study on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 has been reported.
As such, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4.4).
In general, after a virus attacks a host cell, virus identification is initially performed by the host's personal immune system through the Preragic Probe Receptors (PRRs) which include the C-type lectin-like receptors, the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), the NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
The virus through various pathways causes the emergence of inflammatory agents, dendritic cell maturation and the synthesis of interferon type (IFN), which helps to limit the spread of the virus and accelerate its phagocytosis by macrophage in the viral antigen.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV may help the virus escape the immune system.
The adaptive immune system soon becomes capable of fighting the virus.
T lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific virus antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Helper T cells are involved in the production of pre-inflammatory cytokines to help defend cells.
However, CoVs can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunoglobulins include supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies are also essential in the fight against viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient would help neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system results in the localised production of a large number of free radicals which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case scenario, lead to multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by a haphazard appearance, most commonly affecting healthy individuals with pre-existing conditions and pregnant women.
It is a common theme that people who have high levels of exposure to the virus or have poor immune system function are more likely to be infected than others.
Based on a study of 425 initial cases in Wuhan, the median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was determined to be 14-1 days, but in most cases it lasts 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 subjects showed that the period of inactivity is on average 3 days and ranges from zero to 24 days.
A more recent study shows, as explained above, a 4.8 day incubation period (3.0 to 7.2 days) based on a statistical sample of 8,866 cases.
This is critical for health authorities to determine effective quarantine periods based on the most accurate exposure period, thus preventing transmission of the virus from infected persons who do not have symptoms to others.
A common practice is that people exposed to the virus or infected with the virus usually have to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
In most cases, the primary symptom is COVID-19 if it is asymptomatic or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath or reduced tissue oxygenation within a week after onset of disease.
In severe cases, the disease progresses rapidly to the development of acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidification and blood clotting disorders.
Patients with fever or severe respiratory symptoms and fever, even without abnormalities detected in radiological imaging, should be screened for the virus for early detection.
A population study conducted in late December 2019 showed 98 percent of symptoms as follows: 98 percent fever, 76 percent dry cough, 55 percent shortness of breath and 3 percent diarrhea; 8 percent of patients required ventilator devices.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family cohort and a death-related cohort from an asymptomatic individual.
A population study conducted in 2012 showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required ventilators, which is much higher than in COVID-19 patients, indicating that MERS is more lethal than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In patients with SARS, fever (99-100%), dry cough (29-75%), shortness of breath (40-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and gout (13-25%) were reported as the main symptoms, and about 20%-14% of patients needed a ventilator.
By 14 February, when the global confirmed cases reached 66,576, the COVID-19 mortality rate was around 2%.
In comparison, the SARS mortality rate by November 2002 was around 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
Based on a population study in June 2012, the mortality rate for MERS accounted for 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
One of the previous studies suggests that the R0 for SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 6.47 to 6.47 and the 95% confidence interval (CI) is between 5.71 and 7.23, while the R0 range for SARS-CoV is only between 2 and 4.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 are presented in Table 1.1.
The images above show that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater potential for outbreak than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but SARS-CoV-2 is less lethal than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the control of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is much more difficult than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV respectively.
The beginning of a new relationship often occurs within a family or from a gathering place or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Most patients had travelled or lived in Wuhan or other contaminated areas or had contact with infected persons or patients two weeks prior to the onset of illness.
However, it has been reported that individuals can carry the virus for more than two weeks without symptoms, and patients who have recovered and been discharged from hospital can also re-transmit the virus, warning of an increased quarantine period.
In the early stages of the disease, the number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in patients is normally low or low.
For example, lymphophonia with a white blood cell count of less than 4×109/L including lymphocyte count of less than 1×109/L, and elevated levels of aminotransferase aspartate and presence of virus in blood were observed in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
In some patients, the levels of liver, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood were elevated, and in most patients, the C-reactive protein and red blood cell secretion were elevated.
In patients with severe cases, the level of dimer D, which is the result of the breakdown of fibrin in the blood, is increased and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreases.
The abnormalities seen in chest X-ray images are seen in most COVID-19 patients and are characterised by two-sided shadows or a glass-matte appearance in the lungs.
In most patients, abnormal pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are developed.
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and advanced fibrosis can severely compromise an individual's air circulation.
Type I and II dysfunction in the pneumocytes leads to a decrease in surfactant levels and an increase in surface tension, resulting in a decrease in the lung's ability to dilate and an increased risk of lung failure.
Thus, the worse the chest X-ray findings, the more severe the disease spread.
On 18 February 2020, the first COVID-19 pathological analysis of the first COVID-19 analysis showed that the pneumocytes' coating, the formation of the vitreous membrane and the penetration of benzyl benzyl lymphocytes and the synesial cells of the lung which died due to the disease were compatible with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and similar to SARS and MERS patients.
Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-related RNA through reverse polymerase-transcription chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the primary diagnostic criterion for COVID-19.
However, due to the high false negative rate of this method, which may accelerate epidemics, the use of clinical signs (which no longer rely solely on RT-PCR) for disease diagnosis was initiated in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation had occurred for the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of medical history, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and radiological findings is necessary and necessary for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang Protocol Group proposed a protocol using CRISPR-based Sherlock methods to detect SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR-based methods of SARS-CoV-2, which would allow the detection of SARS-CoV-2-related composite RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microlitre of input materials) using a single tape in less than one hour without the need for expensive precision tools.
It is hoped that the new approach, if validated in clinical samples, could dramatically increase the accuracy and convenience of testing.
Given the lack of experience with this novel CoV variant, doctors can mainly provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while different therapies have been proposed to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These include current and potential therapies with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma received from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychosocial support.
Even plasma received from recovered patients has been suggested for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to produce antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially and is likely to have weaker attacks on other ACE2-containing organs, such as the digestive system and kidneys.
As such, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the most important risk factors in the lowest incidence of patients and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support to relieve symptoms is vital and can save a person's life, depending on the severity of the disease, and can include general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilators and invasive mechanical ventilators.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by ECMO, a modified cardiac biopsy technique used to treat cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, electrolyte balance maintenance, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and septic shock, and protection of organ function are also important in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It has been identified that cytokine storm is caused by an overreaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
A cytokine storm is a type of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a cytokine chain including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
This cytokine induces immune cells to release large numbers of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in patients with a serious condition.
The corticosteroid corticosteroid and tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL6, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other treatments to suppress the immune system in order to prevent cytokine storm include T cell-directed immune response modulation; inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumib; cytokine-4 signaling suppressor and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids as immunosuppressant drugs were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, the use of high doses of the steroid in patients with severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19 was not useful.
It may also cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, and significantly affect disease recovery.
Therefore, short courses of low to moderate doses of corticosteroids are recommended to be used with caution in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral treatment for this disease has been confirmed.
However, it was determined that intravenous infusion with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was effective in a US patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral medicine originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Possible inhibition of other single-stranded RNA viruses including MERS and SARS viruses was subsequently demonstrated by remdesivir.
Based on this, Gilead has sent the compound to China for a series of trials in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results have been very promising.
In addition baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been proposed as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this treatment with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma received from recovered patients and antibody production.
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from a communicable disease to be used to treat other patients suffering from a similar disease, or to protect healthy individuals from contracting that disease, has a long history.
In fact, patients who recover often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood to fight the pathogen.
Immunoglobulin (Ig) antibodies are antibodies that are produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, and detect and directly neutralize specific molecules in pathogens.
Based on this, plasma was obtained from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 patients who were still alive.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours by reducing inflammation and viral load and improving oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, large-scale use of this approach needs to be confirmed and transparency before specific treatments can be proposed.
In addition, due to the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related disadvantages should be considered with caution.
For example, antibodies can overexcite the immune response and cause cytokine-releasing syndrome, which is potentially a life-threatening toxin.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and the demand for plasma to treat patients is very high.
It is difficult to quickly produce specific antibodies that are sufficient to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, the isolation of B cells from recovered patients and the identification of antigen-coding genetic codes or the screening of effective antibodies against the original virus proteins is more important and useful.
So, in this way, we can increase the production of antibodies very rapidly.
TCM has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of ailments in China.
However, its effects depend largely on the combination of different components in the formula, which varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on TCM theories.
Most of its effective ingredients are still unknown or obscure, because it is difficult to extract and validate these ingredients or synthesize them optimally.
Currently, TCM has become one of the important therapies for patients with mild symptoms or patients with moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest rates of treatment in COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China, where 87% of patients used TCM, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%). In Hubei Province, where only 30% of COVID-19 patients used TCM, the lowest rates of treatment (13%) were observed.
However, this comparison is not entirely accurate, as many factors such as number and severity of patients must be considered in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western Medicine (WM) alone and WM-TCM combination therapy.
They found that the time required to regain body temperature, disappear symptoms and be in bed was significantly shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group.
More surprisingly, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group (7.4% versus 46.2%), and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM still await better controlled trials at larger scales and more centres.
Determining the mechanism of action and identifying the effective components of TCM treatment or combinations thereof, if possible, is also a topic that has aroused the curiosity of scientists.
Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection often have a high fear of the highly contagious and even fatal disease, and people in quarantine also experience fatigue, loneliness and irritability.
In addition, symptoms of this infection such as fever, hypoxia (lack of oxygen in body tissues), cough, and treatment side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to increased anxiety and mental distress.
In the early stage of the SARS outbreak, a variety of psychiatric complications including severe depression, anxiety, nervous breakdowns, psycho-motor excitations, psychotic symptoms, hallucinations and even suicide have been reported.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of the public health system approach to combating the spread of COVID-19, can make individuals anxious and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigma among family and friends.
Therefore, psychotherapeutic care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons, persons in contact with them as well as the general public in need.
Mental support should include the creation of mental health teams from different disciplines, transparent communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to prevent close contact.
Effective vaccines are needed to sever the chain of transmission from the animal and human populations infected with susceptible hosts and are often used as an adjunct to antiviral therapy in the control of infectious diseases caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to produce strong and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live vaccines attenuated in animal models for SARS have been evaluated.
However, the efficacy of these vaccines in healthy subjects and in highly lethal models and their safety against human-animal co-infection should be determined before the start of clinical studies.
This is probably because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, cases and dispersed MERS clusters continue to occur in the Middle East and are spreading to other regions due to the presence of animal-to-human transmission sources in indigenous areas.
Vaccination routes for MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmid, viral vectors, nanoparticles, particle-like viruses and nootropic protein subunits have been proposed and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Producing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for unimmunized individuals is an essential and vital task to control the epidemic.
However, overcoming this difficulty is difficult due to the long time period required for vaccine production (average 18 months) and the dynamic variations of different CoV strains.
COVID-19 as a novel disease has started a full clinical course in thousands of new patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without the development of complications.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has also been associated with complications and mortality in patients with acute cases.
Therefore, the development of a disease trend predictive model is essential for healthcare organisations to prioritise their services, particularly in areas with limited access.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect the prognosis of the progression of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important predictor of the SARS outbreak, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurs mainly in the 30 to 65 age group; a study of 8,866 patients found that 47.4% of patients were over 50 years of age.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have background complications and abnormalities and were older than those not requiring intensive care (mean age of the first group was 66 and the median age of the second group was 51 years). This suggests that age is a predictor of disease progression and outcome in COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more males than females (0.31/100,000 vs 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Previous illnesses and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have acute cardiac arrest and arrhythmias.
Cardiovascular events were also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes and lead to liver failure in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and background diseases are strongly correlated and may overlap.
Abnormal laboratory findings: Levels of C-reactive protein in the blood are indicative of the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and have been suggested as a potential factor in disease, response to treatment and ultimate recovery.
It has also been suggested that the correlation of CRP levels with the severity and prediction of the progression of COVID-19 disease is also proposed.
In addition, increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict outcomes.
Enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
Therefore, heart or liver disorders are considered as traditional symptoms.
Primary clinical symptoms: To predict the outcome and complications of COVID-19, chest X-rays and timing of progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other issues.
Steroid use: As mentioned above, steroids are immune system suppressors that are commonly used as a treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of the inflammatory damage.
Because high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in patients with SARS, many people who recovered from vascular osteonecrosis suffered from disability throughout life and a decreased quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for a short period of time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental Stress: As explained above, since the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients have suffered from extreme stress, as they are often in quarantine for long periods of time and have experienced severe insecurity and witnessed the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
Providing psychological counselling and long-term support is essential to help these patients recover, relieve stress and return to normal life.
Based on the demographic studies that have been conducted so far, it appears that the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 differ from those of SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 in addition to reproducing in the peripheral respiratory tract can also effectively multiply in the upper respiratory tract and have mild or minor symptoms of infection in the first stage, similar to other CoVs that cause the common cold.
In this way, patients with early stage or period of dementia can produce abundant viruses during daily activities, which can make it difficult to control the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV occurs when patients are severely ill and in the early stages of disease, transmission does not occur.
Therefore, the COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe than the SARS outbreak and is more difficult to control.
Currently, many efforts are underway in China, including a curfew in Wuhan and surrounding cities and continuous quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of breaking the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have severely damaged the economy and other parts of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the disease.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the virus decline phase will continue for 3 to 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and colleagues estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be more primarily contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and colleagues, Ira Longini, developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and believe that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in the mid-nasal and throat swabs of patients who had been discharged from hospital two weeks earlier and recovered, suggesting that the newly identified virus could evolve into a flu-like, cyclical disease.
However, there were promising signs in China based on a decrease in the number of new cases, suggesting that current strategies may be effective.
Ebola was initially predicted to infect one million people and kill half a million.
However, through intense quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally brought under control.
There is a possibility that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will become more pathogenically vulnerable and eventually mutate from a deadly or a low pathogenic virus that lives alongside humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with SARS and MERS is shown below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing and is likely to be transmitted through direct contact with virus-infected material.
The virus has also been found in feces, which provides the possibility of transmission from faeces to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were hospital-acquired infections, including 17 patients with pre-existing conditions and 40 healthcare workers.
Therefore, great care must be taken to protect people, especially healthcare workers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even passersby who come into contact with patients or people with the disease.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of contamination is wearing a face mask; this can be done both through the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (Series 1860), which helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the passage of liquid droplets spread by potentially infected individuals through the air or by sticking to the surface of materials where they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 masks (1860 series) can protect individuals from inhalation of viral particles 10 to 80 nanometers in size, and only 5% of viral particles can pass through them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, and both are approximately 85 nanometers.
Since particles can pass through even five surgical masks stacked on top of each other, healthcare workers in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (Series 1860), not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare personnel should wear isolation gloves to further reduce exposure to viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a physician wearing an N95 mask became infected with SARS-CoV-2 on 22 January 2020; the virus may have been transmitted through inflamed eyes or entered his body.
Therefore, healthcare workers should also use transparent shields and glasses when working with patients.
For the general public in contaminated or potentially contaminated areas, it is highly recommended that individuals wash their hands excessively with disinfectant soaps and try to stay indoors and limit contact with potentially infected persons.
A distance of three feet (one meter) is considered as the appropriate distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 entered the human world as a novel virus, its increased similarity to SARS-CoV reported on 7 January 2020 based on deep memories that the SARS outbreak existed in 2003 has been a significant warning to China.
However, by 19 January 2020, the director of Wuhan Center for Disease Control, the director of Wuhan, had reassured citizens by saying that the infectiousness of the new virus is low, that human-to-human transmission is limited, and that there is no problem in preventing and controlling the disease.
This message significantly reduced public awareness of the risk, especially as the country was preparing for the Spring Festival and a critical time for the containment of the disease on a small scale in Wuhan was over.
Disease control agencies in China may have learned a hard lesson from this and make fundamental improvements in the future.
For example, these organisations should be more vigilant, given that (1) every word spoken by health organisations matters to citizens and can change attitudes and decisions; (2) rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors and authorities, they should be much more sensitive to and react to abnormal reports from clinics; (3) rather than trying to reassure the public, they should take more restrictive measures to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages; and (4) repeatedly issue targeted and effective action plans to raise public awareness of pandemics, test and improve the community's response system in a timely manner.
The outbreak of COVID-19 disease by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months at the time of writing, the virus has spread across China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are similar symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has triggered a sense of SARS recurrence.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are essential to understand for the control of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people, men more than women, and has a higher severity and mortality rate in older people than in young people.
The mortality rate of SARS was higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even when they are asymptomatic, whereas patients with SARS transmit the virus when they are severely ill, making COVID-19 more difficult to contain than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread more and more widely than SARS-CoV.
A routine RNA test in SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, treated patients can become re-infected with the virus and test positive.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of virus spread.
In view of such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several important issues remain unresolved, as described below:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although there is a 96% genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat-like SARS-CoVs, we cannot yet conclude whether SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
Which intermediate animal, known as the virus, transmitted from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop transmission and the outbreak may return at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical analysis have determined that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent disease-dependent mutations?
Does the virus also attach to ACE2-containing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the outbreak continue?
In the human-to-human transmission of viruses, how does it genetically mutate?
Will it become a worldwide pandemic, like SARS, or will it return periodically like influenza?
The answers to the above questions are essential but it may take some time to answer them and many other questions.
However, at whatever cost it may take, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and return our lives to normal.
Animal origin of the human coronavirus
For thousands of years, adaptation has led to the simultaneous evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its hosts, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness such as colds.
The emergence of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has now highlighted how devastating and dangerous HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019, brought the CoV back into the spotlight and surprised us with its high self-infectiousness, but with less symptoms than its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a human-animal communicable disease and identifying the animal origin of HCoVs is helpful.
The origin of most HCoVs is from bats, in which they do not cause disease.
Hosts that act as intermediate reservoirs for some HCoVs have also been identified.
Identification of animal hosts has a direct impact on the prevention of disease in humans.
Studying CoV host interactions in animals could also provide important insights into the pathogenesis of CoVs in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the knowledge available about seven HCoVs, focusing on their discovery history as well as animal origin and interspecies transmission.
An important topic to consider when comparing different HCoVs is from the perspective of viral evolution and genetic notation.
The current outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the need for successful host mutation and viral evolution for disease severity is examined in this article.
The coronavirus (CoVها) belongs to the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of enveloped viruses, with positive polarity and single-stranded RNA.
These viruses, which have the largest genome of 26 to 32 kB among RNA viruses, were named "CoVs" because their crown-like morphology is under the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have integrated genomes that share a similar structure.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large readable recessive structures (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are converted to polyprotein replicases pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyprotein is further processed and produces 16 non-structural proteins, which are named nsp1 through 16.
The remaining part of the genome includes the ORF, which is used for structural proteins such as spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleopropylene (N).
A number of ancestral specific by-protein sequences have been encoded by different ancestral CoVs.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), among which the beta-CoV genus includes most of its HCoVs and is divided into four genera (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as the source of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genes, while birds are the primary repository of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
Over thousands of years, CoVs have continuously crossed species barriers, and some of them have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63r alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL6 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds or diarrhea.
In contrast, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and the novel SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing infections of the lower respiratory tract in most patients and potentially causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and exopulmonary symptoms.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretions of patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, knowledge has been increased through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 that both cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HCoV infection is generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak of 2003 is one of the most devastating outbreaks of modern times, infecting more than 8,000 people and causing roughly 10% of the deaths.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak led to an epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula that spread to other parts of the world.
In 2019, the novel HCoV (2019-nCoV) novel HCoV (2019-nCoV) subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2 became the cause of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic, which killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people by March 3, 2020.
The danger is looming and the world must prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
One in seven HCoVs have animal origin including bats, mice or domestic animals.
There is considerable evidence that all HCoVs are of evolutionary origin from bats, where the viruses are well adapted and present without symptoms and show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the world.
Tracing the origin of animal disease provides a framework for understanding the natural history, triggers and limiting factors of species mutation.
It may also facilitate the detection of SARS-CoV-2's reservoir, intermediate host and animal amplifier hosts and have important implications in preventing future pandemics.
In this review, we will review the animal origin, interspecies transmission, and HCoV transmission.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that HCoVs in their natural habitat are not normally pathogenic, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also investigate the evolutionary pattern of HCoVs in which the increase in viral infection is often accompanied by a decrease in STDs.
The implications of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in this context have also been discussed.
Animal CoVs have been known to us since the late 1930s.
Prior to the initial isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814, from nasal secretions of patients with the common cold, different CoVs were isolated from various animal species including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) may be informative and informative.
In 1966, the first HCoV-229E sequence was sampled from the respiratory tract of patients with an HAV infection and subsequently adapted for growth in WI-38 lung cell culture.
Patients with HCoV-229E had common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, weakness, sore throat, and fever and cough in 10 to 20 percent of patients.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture in the laboratory and gradually entered the brains of small mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-229E-induced HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those of HCoV-229E-induced HCoV-OC43 infection, which is not detectable due to symptoms from other respiratory infections such as influenza A and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229 and HCoV-OC43 are both globally distributed and are transmitted mainly during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation period of N2V is less than one week and after that, the illness lasts for about 2 weeks.
According to studies conducted on human volunteers, healthy individuals who were infected with HCoV-229E developed mild colds.
Only in a few immunocompromised patients, severe infection of the lower respiratory tract was observed.
SARS disease, also known as "Self-Pneumonic Atypical Pick", is the first SARS-CoV-caused pandemic in human history and the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first case of SARS was detected in late 2002 in the Guangdong province of China.
The SARS outbreak infected 8,096 people, killed 774 and spread to many countries and continents.
Except for extreme cases of spread, estimated to be approximately two cases per case, the incubation period is 4 to 7 days and the peak viral load appears on the 10th day of illness.
Patients with SARS-CoV infection initially experienced muscle pain, headache, fever, weakness and tremors, followed by shortness of breath, cough and respiratory distress as subsequent symptoms.
Lymphopnea, impaired liver function test, and increased seratin kinase, are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Extensive allele destruction, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages have also been observed in SARS patients.
Subsequently, about 20 to 30% of patients required intensive care and mechanical ventilators.
In addition to the sub-parasite respiratory system, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney were affected in acute cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which could be fatal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first sampled during a pulmonary tissue extraction operation of a relative of an indicated patient who had travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, there have been many attempts to investigate HCoVs.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old infant in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially identified that the disease is common in young children, elderly patients and immunocompromised persons with respiratory diseases.
Cold, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchitis are common in HCoV-NL63-induced disease.
In another independent study, isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands was described.
Although the virus was identified in the Netherlands, it actually spread globally.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to account for about 4.7% of chronic respiratory diseases, with peak incidence occurring in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with ankylosing spondylitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old male hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchitis.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with an increased incidence of acute asthma.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide and causes mild respiratory illnesses.
These four families, transmitted through community, are well adapted to humans and are generally less prone to serious illness, although cases may occur for unknown reasons, such as in a recently reported rare case, the HCoV-NL63 strain of the common cold-causing respiratory infection in China.
In general, when these HCoVs gain the ability to transmit effectively and sustain themselves in humans, the severity of virulence or hereditary disease is reduced.
MERS-CoV was isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal insufficiency in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases of the virus originate from the Middle East, imported cases with secondary spread due to close contact have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
A second outbreak was confirmed in South Korea in 2015 with 186 cases.
The clinical manifestation of MERS is similar to SARS, which is characterized by advanced acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also developed acute renal failure, which is among the HCoV-specific diseases associated with MERS.
More than 30% of patients had gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases with high fatalities of 34.4% were reported, making MERS-CoV one of the most dangerous viruses known to humans.
From mid to late December 2019, clusters of patients with SARS-CoV-2 related infectious diseases were identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
The World Health Organization initiated the outbreak of a sub-lower respiratory tract infection by declaring a global public health emergency due to SARS-CoV-2 and naming the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, the number of confirmed cases worldwide had risen to 90,053 and the crude death rate was 3.4%.
It is noteworthy that the mortality rate in Hubei, China was 4.2% while the mortality rate was 1.2% abroad.
SARS-CoV-2 like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoVs cause severe respiratory infections in the form of fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Diarrhoea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the 82% homology above the nucleotide sequence, they are clustered into different branches on the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Some reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were not present, which could contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with HCoV variants reveal other significant similarities and differences.
The first case is that the incubation period and the duration of the HCoV disease cycle are also very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general course of HCoVs in the lungs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is the mid-range SARS-CoV and four HCoVs transmitted from the community (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
A SARS-CoV-2 infection by SARS-CoV-2 exhibits characteristics that are commonly seen in community-transmitted HCoV infections, including non-specific, mild or even in some cases asymptomatic symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of acute COVID-19 cases can also be seen in SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 indicates interesting patterns of HCoVs and SARS-CoVs transmitted from the community.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-transmitted HCoVs.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV decreases after a few transmissions between humans.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the samples collected.
Whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission via feces or urine like SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in transmission, at least in some circumstances, remains to be elucidated by future studies.
It is also interesting to see whether SARS-CoV-2 is similar to HCoVs transmitted from community, may be seasonal or not.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including transmissibility, pathogenesis and sustained spread after transmission from person to person will affect the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
One in four HCoVs transmitted from a community that produces mild disease symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, this may be true if humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of the ancient HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs that caused severe disease in humans and humans that became severely infected with HCoVs are now extinct.
To do this, HCoVs must multiply sufficiently in humans to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize host limiting factors.
In this case, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continues and the more people become infected, the greater the chance of the virus's full human adaptation.
If the virus adapts well, it will be difficult to prevent transmission to humans by quarantine or other infection control measures.
Four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating in human communities for several years, causing common colds in people with healthy immune systems.
These viruses do not require an animal source.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not adapted to humans and their transmission between humans cannot be sustainable.
These viruses need to be conserved and spread in their animal reservoirs and are looking for opportunities to infect human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics that are similar to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs.
This virus, like HCoVs transmitted from the community, has high transmissibility, at least for the time being.
However, the incidence of hereditary disease is lower from community-transmitted HCoVs and higher from SARS-CoV or MERS-CoVs.
It remains to be seen whether the virus will fully adapt to humans and be transmitted between humans without a reservoir, intermediate or animal host.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoVs, it is useful to consider the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and replicator hosts of HCoVs.
If the host animal is very close to a virus with high nucleotide sequence-level affinity, that animal acts as an evolutionary host for HCoV.
An ancestral virus is usually well adapted in a host and therefore not pathogenic.
Similarly, a host stores, continuously and for a long time, HCoVs.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and the natural host is HCoV or Waldeush viruses.
In contrast, if HCoVs have had a median host before infecting humans, or approximately the same median host time, they are not well adapted to the new host and are often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as an animal repository for human infection, and as a replicating host by providing the possibility of temporary replication of the virus and then transmission to humans, increasing the level of infection in humans.
If HCoVs cannot maintain their transmission in a stable intermediate host, they can cause fatal infections.
In contrast, HCoVs can adapt to intermediate hosts and even remain present in the host group for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate host acts as a physical repository host.
Epidemiological data suggest that the first case of SARS was associated with predatory animals.
Subsequent epidemiological studies have shown that levels of immunoglobulin G against SARS virus are higher in animal products retailers than in the general population.
For the first time, a number of masked palm frogs (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog were detected in the live animal market carrying SARS-CoV-like viruses that were approximately identical to SARS-CoV.
A 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic for SARS-CoV was found in strains taken at the beginning of the human epidemic.
At the same time, it has been reported that masked palm fronds from forest or farmland that were not marketed as live animals were largely negative due to the presence of SARS-CoV. This suggests that masked palm fronds are likely to be only a median and reproductive host, not a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that 80% of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, so the possibility that several species of small mammals may also act as intermediate booster hosts for SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All of these appear to be SARS-CoV final hosts.
In the subsequent search for a natural animal host, SARS-CoV, a type of coronavirus that is highly related to bat CoV and known as SARS-related HKU3 coronavirus, was identified as the horse-neck bat (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) that lived in Chinese horse-neck bats.
These bats are anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence positive.
This virus and other bat CoVs have 88-92% similarity in nucleotide sequence to SARS-CoV.
These studies led to the new theory that bats host modern human-borne viruses.
A number of SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats, but none other than WIV1 have been isolated as live viruses.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for SARS-CoV was identified.
WIV1 from bat feces showed that ACE2 is used as a receptor for cell entry in bats, seals and humans.
Interestingly, the serum of patients recovering from SARS was able to neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 has been the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, with 95% similarity in nucleonid sequence, with 95% similarity in nucleonid sequence.
Although there is considerable overlap between these two virus types, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the parent SARS-CoV virus and bats, the host of the SARS-CoV reservoir, are not.
Phylogenetic analysis has isoformed MERS-CoV with similar groups such as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoVs use a host-like receptor called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) to enter the virus.
RNA-associated RNA polymerase RNA-dependent sequences associated with MERS-CoV are phylogenetically most closely related to bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoVs have been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, bat-type CoV-HKU25, are only 87 percent similar in terms of nucleotide sequence.
Therefore bats cannot be hosts of the MERS-CoV direct storage.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that mountain camels are positive for MERS-CoV specific neutralising antibodies, which is also true for Middle Eastern camels in the African country of Mozambique.
MERS-CoV living similar to the virus found in humans, samples from the nose of a mountain camel were taken and showed that the camels were true MERS-CoV reservoir hosts.
It should be noted that generally mild and very high viral replication symptoms have been observed in subjects who were experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that infected camels transmit the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the primary method of transmitting the virus in bats.
However, one question that has remained unanswered since then is that in many of the confirmed MERS cases there was no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, possibly attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission pathways involving unidentified animal species.
SARS-CoV-2 has about 96.2% nucleotide sequence similarity to the RaTG13 bat-like CoV virus isolated from the nasal-nail bat.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is excellent for determining parental relationship.
In other words, bats cannot be hosts of the immediate reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 virus unless bat CoVs are produced in a future that is approximately identical.
Presumably, animal hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in which many of the first COVID-19 cases were seen, must have been among wild animals sold and killed at the Hunanbude seafood market, indicating possible animal-to-human transmission of the virus.
Recent studies based on metasequence sequencing suggest that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may also be the habitat of SARS-CoV-2-associated ancestral beta-CoVs.
This newly genetically modified CoV pandulin virus species has about 85-92% nucleotide sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-2.
However, these viruses are equally related to RaTG13 with about 90% similarity in nucleotide sequence.
The viruses are classified into two subtypes of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which has a similar receptor binding domain to SARS-CoV-2 and 97.4% amino acid sequence homology.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more differentiated, however, by a higher degree than sequence similarity across the genome.
In a previous study on diseased pangolins, it was reported that from lung samples, fragments of viral DNA were isolated that were associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The study used various sequencing techniques and manual modification to create a portion of the genome sequence that constitutes about 86.3% of the virus genome length.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the animal mediator hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in the pangolin, as there is divergence between the SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoVs sequence associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pangolin.
Furthermore, the gap between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the gap between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoVs associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pangolin.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is still unknown.
While the greatest sequence similarity in RBD was observed between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, beta-CoVs related to beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest sequence similarity in genomic sequence.
It is speculated that a high degree of similarity between the RBDs of beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 pangolin and SARS-CoV-2 is due to selective homogeneous evolution.
A different proposal, however, is to recombine SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoVs in the pangolin and RaTG13 in a third wild animal species.
Nootrkebi is common among beta-CoVs as a catalyst in evolution.
Its judgments on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 are not complete.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, animal origin HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 are also under study.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229 may have been derived from bat CoVs, while the parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are found in bats.
A bat CoV named .ARCoV2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) that has been observed in North American trilobite bats has been reported to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat CoV named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008 that was discovered in Ghana, while its homologue is also suspected as an intermediate host for the virus.
For clarity, the existing knowledge on the animal origin of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission of HCoVs in history.
In 1890, when HCoV-OC43 caused transmission between different animal species to infect humans through the intestine, a pandemic of respiratory infections was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not well defined.
Bat alpha-CoVs that are closely related to HCoV-229E have been identified.
Among them is an alpha-alpacaealpha-CoV.
Multiple evidence supports direct transmission of the virus by bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, may communicate with bats in a shared ecological environment.
Instead, humans are closely related to the alkapha.
Second, HCoV-229E-associated bat alpha-CoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas alpha-CoV alpacae causes respiratory disease outbreaks in animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpaca has not been detected in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that Alpaca has detected HCoV-229E-associated alpha-CoVs in humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including the Hari virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Handra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while bat alpha-CoVs act as the HCoV-229E gene repository, alpacas and unicorns may act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just as was seen in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to mountain camels and from camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats was apparent from the very beginning of the virus identification and subsequent findings reinforced this theory.
It is clear that bats provide a rich repository of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Long life, crowded colonies, close social interaction and a strong ability to fly are all conditions that make bats an ideal virus-spreader.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to the monkey camel for decades.
The virus has adapted well to this host and this host has been transformed from an intermediate host to a stable and natural host.
MERS-CoVs are highly pathogenic and in these animals, have relatively low mutation rates.
Unintentional transmission of the virus to humans is a random event, and humans are the MERS-CoV host, as transmission cannot be sustained.
Compared to the role of the shad in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of the pangolin, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, the beta-CoV of the pangolin is highly pathogenic in pangolins.
These animals may be hosts of SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoVs, similar to those of SARS-CoV.
There are several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans that must be accepted or rejected in future studies.
First, bats could be hosts of a SARS-CoV-2 related virus, which is roughly similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may have shared an ecological status with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, pangolin could be one of the median booster hosts if a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 has recently been introduced.
Human beings are infected with the virus through butchering and consumption of prey meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are at high risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2.
It is necessary to check domestic and wild animals for pathogens.
Third, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 nootropicity and adaptation may have occurred in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for an animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three other virological factors are also important to facilitate the passage of the CoV through existing barriers.
First of all, they have a relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
The estimated rate of mutation in the CoV virus, at an average replacement rate, is equivalent to approximately 10-4 replacements per year per site 2, depending on the stage of adaptation of the CoV to the new host, which can be considered as "medium" to "high" compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses.
CoVs have an exoribonuclease correction defect whose deletion can lead to very high mutation, morbidity or even failure to continue.
Interestingly, Remdesivir is able to inhibit the multiplication of CoVs by inhibiting nucleotide analogues of exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerases.
Remdesivir is one of the promising agents against SARS-CoV-2 to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of CoV mutation is about one million times greater than that of the host.
In addition, the mutation rate is high when the CoVs have not adapted well to the host.
Compared to the high mutation rate SARS-CoV-CoV, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, indicating a higher level of human compatibility.
It is likely that the virus has now become compatible with another host that is close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this is also true for MERS-CoV, which is well-compatible with the one-horned camel.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic modification could rapidly make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large genome RNA RNA in the CoVs, which provides additional flexibility in genome editing for genetic and neuroprotective mutations and therefore increases the probability of interspecies mutation, which under the right conditions contributes to the emergence of new CoVs.
This is supported by a large amount of unique open reading frameworks and protein functions that are encoded toward the 3' end of the genome.
Third, CoVs randomly and repeatedly change their moulds during RNA replication through a unique "copy-selection" mechanism.
In a host that acts as a mixing reservoir, string substitution occurs frequently during CoV RNA transcription.
Subgenomic and fully homologous long-length RNAs can recombine to produce new CoVs.
In both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and animal CoVs such as bat-CoV and batCoV-HKU9, phylogenetic evidence for natural notoriphobia has been produced.
Virus - host interaction in connection with transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
Here, the SARS-CoV notarized is considered a typical specimen, showing evidence of positive selection during the interspecies transmission event.
Based on a comparative analysis between isolated human specimens and SARS-CoVs, it is assumed that SARS-CoV has rapid adaptation in different hosts, especially with mutations in RBD protein S.
In general, RBD in the S protein of the CoV virus, interacts with the cellular receptor and induces a strong antibody response of the host.
In the SARS-CoV, there is a 318 to 510 amino acid and a S1 segment on the surface, which binds to human ACE2 and the common viral entry receptors.
RBD SARS-CoV is capable of detecting ACE2 receptors in a variety of animals including bats, seals, mice and raccoon dogs, which provides the possibility of interspecies transmission for the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only the remaining 6 amino acid residues from human and SEVV viral samples differed in RBD and 4 of them are located in the binding-receptor motif for the ACE2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV-2 strain has K479N and S487T mutations in RBD itself that may increase the interaction of the brain protein with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be vital for viral adaptation to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has a cellular receptor similar to SARS-CoV.
The presence of a 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in a single S1 protein S suggests that the tendency of S protein S to bind to human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study suggests that there is a 10 to 20-fold tendency for this link between human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another common receptor is needed for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but not to another part of S.
There are many HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV - OC43.
These receptors may also explain the successful adaptation of NCoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also controlled by other host-dependent and limiting factors.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and natural HCoV hosts such as bats, camels, and rodents may create an impediment to interspecies transmission.
For successful interspecies transmission, HCoVs must control host-dependent factors and eliminate host-limiting factors.
In this context, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction should be identified and characterised.
Completely neutral genome-wide screening of host affinity and limiting factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology may be productive.
Modern HCoVs: from the beginning
Bat CoV diversity has provided ample opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this case, bat CoVs act as a repository for HCoV genes.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic notation also facilitate the evolutionary progression of HCoVs and act as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or manipulation of novel protein-coding genes, for example, has the potential to drastically alter viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV side proteins, the ORF8 protein is thought to play an important role in human adaptation, as it was determined after isolating SARS-CoV-associated bat virus that the virus encodes different ORF8 proteins.
The nucleotide-29 deletion characteristic of SARS-CoV virus was observed in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that contributes to host mutation.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible notorkebic history with alpha and gamma CoV ancestors, where a large number of smaller notorkebic domains were identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
The nucleus of the nucleus of the nucleus of nsp9, the major portion of nsp10 and parts of nsp14 were identified.
It has also been shown that the MERS-CoV virus has experienced a variety of pathogenic, inter-ancestral, inter-neurotrophic events that occurred in the Shter-Tuk Mountains of Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, other HCoVs have also been observed to have a nootropic event where HCoVs are combined with other animal CoVs in their own non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in the viral genome, most likely caused by the release of viruses from selective stress, for example by the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the complete-length ORF4 deletion in the HCoV-229E prototype strain due to the deletion of two nucleotides.
Although intact and complete ORF4 can be observed in HCoV-229 E related viruses in bats and camels, alpha-CoV alpaca is induced by a single extra nucleotide leading to a change in the framework.
Last but not least, the evolution of modern HCoVs is also driven by selective pressure in their host reservoir.
No or mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating cross-compatibility between CoVs and bats.
Bates appear to have adapted anatomically and physiologically well to the CoV.
For example, a lack of activation of the pre-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduces the damage caused by CoVs.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to the regulation of NKG2/CD94 inhibitor killer cell receptor and low levels of tissue compatibility of large complex class I molecules.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from high metabolic activity in bats can both suppress CoV replication and affect exoribonuclease repair, thereby providing selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic strains of the virus when a new host is introduced.
CoV strains that are mostly pathogenic may be neutralised, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause subtle symptoms in reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
These viruses multiply aggressively without encountering a strong host immune response.
Herein lies the mystery of why unsymptomatic pregnancies are seen and what causes serious human infectious diseases.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the intense activity of the immune system and cytokine storms, whereby the stronger the immune system response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response to CoV replication is distinct.
The immuno-response isolation strategy may have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 drug-drug interactions.
The interferon responses in bats are particularly strong.
Therefore, administration of interferon type I, at least at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be useful.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is impaired.
With this reasoning, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome in combination with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the overall nature of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV events, is dependent on the outcome.
While bat-beta-CoV has 95% nucleotide affinity for SARS-CoV, there is also a bat-beta-CoV with 96% nucleotide affinity for SARS-CoV-2.
While the identified seahorses and other shelter market animals were SARS-CoV-like viruses, the immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs that are very similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, suggesting that the pangolin may act as an intermediate host or that pangolin beta-CoVs may contribute to the gene fragments in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
There is no evidence yet that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally synthesized by humans, although there are questions.
CoVs have come back into focus due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Studying CoVs in bats and other animals has dramatically altered our understanding of the importance of animal origin and HCoV storage in human-to-human transmission.
Comprehensive evidence has shown that MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in bats and are transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originates from human-to-seabird contact in the marketplace, closing the seafood market and killing the seabird could effectively end SARS.
For the same reason, the pangolins should be removed from the marine animal market to prevent animal-to-human transmission, as the discovery of several beta-CoV ancestral pangolins that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2 is a reason.
However, clarifying how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from pangolins and other mammals to humans still requires further research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long been present in monohumans.
The shatra is considered an important means of transportation as well as the main source of meat, milk, leather and fur products for the local people.
These strains are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore it is not possible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done at the Chinese wildlife market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrence of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to produce effective vaccines against MERS-CoVs for use in combination with other contamination control standards.
Since we are unable to eradicate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge and cause disease outbreaks.
Variants of human-animal-common CoVs in wildlife are circulating.
In particular, bat CoVs with the potential for animal-to-human transmission are highly diverse.
There are many opportunities for these human-animal-common CoVs to grow and recombine, leading to the emergence of new CoVs that are highly transmissible and lethal.
The practice of eating wild animals in some areas of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the tough test that SARS, MERS and COVID-19 have brought us, we need to have a better plan to prepare and respond.
In fact, many viruses have been around for a long time on this planet.
They remain in their natural reserves until the opportunity arises for their re-entry.
Although bats have many characteristics that contribute to the spread of viruses, if people are trained to avoid them, the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife could be minimized.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential to better understand the ecology of the CoV and its natural hosts and will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and spread.
Consequently, the most effective way to prevent HCV is for humans to stay away from the natural ecological reservoirs of HCV.
Several pieces of the puzzle of animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 have yet to be discovered.
First, if a bat transmitted an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to a pangolin, it would be interesting to see under what conditions the bat and the pangolin were able to coexist in a common ecological situation.
Second, if bats played a direct role in transmission to humans, how did humans come into contact with bats?
Third, if a third mammal actually acted as a mediator host, how it interacted with different species including humans, bats and pangolins.
And finally, since many mammals including domestic animals may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be undertaken.
Whether the target animal is a bat, pangolin or any other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses that are nearly identical are expected to be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the COVID-19 diagnostic criteria for "suspicious sources" and "confirmed sources"
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick guide for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 (2019-nCoV) coronavirus, which provides our experience and is a good reference for fighting the pandemic worldwide.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the ongoing research findings and clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are continuously updated.
In this article, we provide an overview of our own guidelines and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspicious material" and "confirmed material" based on the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (Seventh Edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak of disease, now officially named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), also known as acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
To combat the SARS-CoV-2 disease, the team published a quick guide to the development and online publication of the systemic medicine research journal on February 6, 2020.
This guide has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
Please note that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our awareness and knowledge will gradually increase based on the findings of ongoing research and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic and treatment approaches are continuously updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have been published a total of seven times with some text changes.
Now Zhou and colleagues have provided a view of our guidelines, including a simple differentiation proposal based on their clinical experience.
An article that added new evidence to our guide and also provided a valuable reference for the pandemic worldwide.
We acknowledge and express our appreciation for their outstanding work.
However, the article should be updated in line with the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (Seventh Edition) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm suspected cases, one of the features of the history of epidemic diseases must be combined with two cases of clinical manifestations to provide a comprehensive analysis, or if the patient has no history of epidemic diseases, it must meet three cases of clinical manifestations:
Epidemiologic history: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan and its surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported within 14 days before symptoms appeared; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 patients (positive on nucleic acid testing); (3) history of contact with fever or respiratory disease patients from Wuhan and its surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported within 14 days before symptoms appeared; (4) history of contact with confirmed hosts (number of more than 2 cases of fever or respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks in small areas such as home, office, school, classroom, etc.).
Clinical symptoms: (1) respiratory symptoms or symptoms; (2) imaging data taken from COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, elevated or decreased lymphocyte count in the early stage of disease onset.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases in combination with one of the pathogenic cases or serological evidence as described below: (1) a blood-clotting PCR test for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2; (2) a total virus genome sequence showing high homology to the novel coronavirus; (3) being positive for IgM specific antibody and IgG serum test SARS-CoV-2; or a change of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody from negative to positive, or an increase of more than 4 times the tetra in the early stage compared to the acute stage.
We can see that the Blood Color PCR test for respiratory nucleic acid or blood samples has been added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Pathogenic diagnosis was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes were made based on the continuous work of researchers who sought a nucleic acid diagnostic kit optimized for rapid diagnosis, and also on respiratory sampling including blood sampling, which allowed greater access to differentiated samples and supported specific antibody positivity in confirmed standards.
In addition, there is increasing evidence that warns us to treat with caution unusual symptoms and asymptomatic illnesses.
Therefore, the diagram of Zhou et al. should be updated, because in this flowchart an individual with no clinical symptoms is classified as "low risk".
The system of discrimination also needs to be validated in practice and with further clinical studies.
To summarize, we hope that more direct evidence will be presented and we ask readers to provide their views.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious" and "confirmed" materials, we suggest that doctors follow and follow the latest guidelines in their countries.
Our team will also regularly provide guidance on how to provide day-to-day assistance.
Bangladesh reported five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest daily number ever.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths on this day.
This was the highest number of daily deaths due to the virus.
Recently, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research Bangladesh (IEDCR) reported that cases of infection have been recorded, including 114 active cases and 33 recoveries if they rest at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, Director of IEDCR, said in an online news conference that the death toll was four men and one woman.
According to Dr Meerjady, two patients were over 60 years of age, two were between 50 and 60 years of age, and one was between 41 and 50 years of age.
He also added that two of the victims were residents of Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
A hospital employee told Anadolu News Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead, Jalal Seifur Rahman, a director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, Obaidul Quader, Minister of Road Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh, announced in an online video announcement that public transport will be closed until next Saturday, which is longer than originally planned.
The public transportation shutdown initially began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The shipments of basic goods - medical supplies, fuel and food - continued.
The first COVID-19 case reported in Bangladesh was on 8 March, when two passengers who had returned from Italy and the spouse of one of them were also present.
On 19 March, all three recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than one million people worldwide
Data from Johns Hopkins University indicates that as of Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections worldwide has exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 deaths are attributed to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
With the confirmation of the first coronavirus case in Malawi and the first coronavirus-related death in Zambia, this day became a turning point.
On Thursday, North Korea claimed that it was one of the few countries free of coronavirus infection.
The World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases as of yesterday, with 79,332 of those cases occurring twenty-four hours before 10:00 AM Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS NEWS reported that more than 1,000 deaths were reported in the United States on Wednesday due to coronavirus infection, based on data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have taken more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Thursday extended the city lockdown until May 1.
President Vladimir Putin announced that the salaries and rights of Russian citizens will be paid nationwide, without the need for a redundancy, by April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency for another 15 days; the law was passed by 215 votes in favour, 10 against and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia has extended the frequency limitation in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to all hours of the day; previously, the frequency limitation was only in effect between 3 pm and 6 am.
Thailand plans to implement frequency restrictions between 10pm and 4am.
Mike DeWine, Governor of Ohio, announced that the state has extended home quarantine regulations through May 1.
Australian department stores have reduced the share of purchases of toiletries for each purchase.
Australia's Woolworths and Coles chain stores reduced the restriction on buying toiletries at all stores nationwide to two and one packets per purchase, respectively, on Saturday and Sunday afternoons.
The ALDI store also announced a one-package purchase restriction on Monday.
These restrictions are announced in the form of messages on the boxes and on the Facebook page of the chain stores.
According to reports, shoppers are moving to shop and store due to fear of the need for personal quarantine due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
Also on Wednesday, Woolworths limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one package per order.
The changes were made in continuation of the previous four-pack limit per purchase announced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles said in a press release on March 8 that despite the four-pack purchase restriction, "many existing stores will be sold out within an hour" and called the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI also described it as "unexpected" on its Facebook page on Tuesday.
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, sales volumes experienced a "severe increase" in the past week.
Costco in Canberra also limited the amount of permitted purchases to two packages last week.
To reduce this shortage, Coles has recommended larger packages to suppliers and increased delivery rates to stores, Woolworths has recommended more inventory. ALDI has made inventory for one of its Wednesday specials available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to increase their inventory, but local council restrictions on timing of delivery trucks made it difficult.
He said he expects production costs to rise as suppliers try to meet demand and special sales are reduced.
On Tuesday, ALDI Store announced that some stores were unable to hold a special Wednesday sale due to early availability.
Dr Gary Mortimer, retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, in a report on News.com.au, said that stores are filling their inventory every night.
He added that the volume of toilet paper leads to the fact that the stock of stores is small in number and when this product is finished, it will free up a lot of space in the shelves and create a feeling of scarcity.
Russell Zimmerman told ABC News that Coles and Woolworths believe that if there are a lot of products on the shelf, if there are a lot of products like toiletries and disinfectants and you can afford them, your fear will probably be minimized.
Who Gives a Crap, the manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, announced last Wednesday that it was running out of stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the manufacturer of Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, the manufacturer of Sorbent toilet paper, both confirmed that they are operating 24/7 to meet the demand.
Domain.com, one of the most active real estate sites, reported that when fewer auctions were held due to the long holiday holiday weekend, some real estate sellers were donating free toiletries to the first bidders in Melbourne.
The Thursday edition of NT News, one of Darwin's newspapers, has a special eight-page newsletter that can be cut and used as a toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia's report on 3 March, these stores were not originally willing to impose restrictions and announced that they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is also a high demand for other goods, including masks, disinfectants, dry goods, toilet soap and liquid, and flour.
Outside Australia, the British online supermarket Ocado, on Sunday afternoon, also witnessed the restrictions on the purchase of Andres's toilet paper in two packages of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19 - caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 - a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the extent of a disease's spread, not to its seriousness, WHO nevertheless stressed the need for governments to take countermeasures:
All countries can still change the duration of this pandemic.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO, said that it is necessary if countries are to prepare their populations for diagnosis, testing, treatment, quarantine and tracking.
We are deeply concerned, both at the alert level of the disease outbreak and its severity and at the alert level of the lack of adequate action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is "unprecedented".
In a statement released by CNN in February, he said: "Apart from influenza, no other respiratory virus has been traced back to a continuous global outbreak from its origin".
Ghebreyesus also made a similar comment: "Before, we had never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus".
"And we've never seen a pandemic before that was, at the same time, controllable".
The current pandemic status was established following the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency with international monitoring.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak: "The front-line situation is getting worse".
The Associated Press reported that as of Thursday, there had been at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 20-2019 coronavirus pandemic 20-2019 is an ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and was declared a public health emergency under international supervision on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is estimated at around 4%, while globally it has varied from 0.08% in New Zealand to 13.04% in Algeria.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Symptoms may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from the virus entering the body to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can vary between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific treatment for it.
Primary treatment is symptomatic treatment and supportive treatment. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth during coughing, distancing from other people, and monitoring and personal quarantine for people who are suspected of being infected.
Countries around the world have reacted to the virus with travel restrictions, quarantines, military rule, workplace hazard control, and lockout.
The pandemic has led to severe socio-economic disruptions, postponements or cancellations of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread resource shortages, exacerbated by neuro-pricing.
Schools and universities in 193 countries were closed either nationally or locally, affecting 99.4% of students worldwide.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, leading to cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people and other people of East and Southeast Asian descent, as well as people from areas with widespread virus outbreaks.
Due to travel restrictions and the closure of heavy industries, air pollution and carbon emissions have been reduced.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (Hubei Province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia with unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and in early January 2020, an investigation was initiated.
These cases were mainly related to the Havana seafood wholesale market and therefore the virus is thought to have animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak of the disease, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus closely related to the bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV. It was later determined that the first known individual with symptoms became ill on 1 December 2019 and that this individual had no apparent association with the subsequent group associated with the seafood market.
It was found that of the initial cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were related to this market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post claimed that a case of infection was detected on 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old male from Hubei province who could be the first case. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that despite a reported decline in cases in China, there was a sudden increase in cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and for the first time the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number of new cases inside China.
The number of cases may be significantly less than the actual number reported, especially among people with milder symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases among young people had been reported, with people aged 19 and under accounting for only 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, England's chief scientific adviser, estimated that around 60% of the UK population would need to be infected to be able to effectively achieve mass immunity.
The number of cases is the number of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and whose test has been declared positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, have adopted a formal policy that only people with mild symptoms are tested.
A study published on 16 March found that as of 23 January, approximately 86% of COVID-19 cases had gone undetected and these unregistered cases were the source of 79% of the new cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of cases in Italy was significantly higher than reported.
Initial estimates of the baseline infection count (R0) for COVID-19 were between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the number could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who did not improve, the time interval between onset of symptoms and death ranged from 6 to 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths were in people over 60 years of age, with 70% of them having underlying diseases including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official death toll figures from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to those who tested positive for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 could be much higher, as these figures may include people who died without testing - for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Inadequate data from Italy suggested that the number of deaths without testing during the pandemic was about 5-4 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated "We know that [stated death toll] is lower than the actual figure", this statement is consistent with informal reports based on lower statistical visibility in the United States. Such measures often occur during pandemics, including in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death occurred on January 9, 2020 in Wuhan.
The first death outside mainland China occurred in the Philippines on 1 February and the first death outside Asia on 14 February in France.
As of 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths have been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than 40 countries and governmental territories on all continents, including Antarctica, reported deaths. Different measurement scales are usually used to measure mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health status. Mortality rate is obtained by dividing the number of deaths by the total number of diagnosed cases over a period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality rate as of 10 April 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
This figure varies from region to region.
In China, the estimated mortality rate was reduced from 17.3% (for people with symptom onset from January 10-1, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptom onset after February 1, 2020).Other measurements include the case fatality rate (CFR), which indicates the percentage of people with identified disease who die from a disease, and the disease mortality rate (IFR), which indicates the percentage of people with identified (identified and undiagnosed) disease who die from a disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from diagnosis to resolution.
A number of academics have attempted to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Oxford University Evidence-Based Medicine Centre estimates that the overall mortality rate for this pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
This maximum range estimate is consistent with the results obtained from the first randomized COVID-19 test in Germany, as well as a statistical study that analyses the effect of the test on the estimated CFR.
WHO confirms that the pandemic is controllable.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak cannot be definitively stated and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University stated: "Common infectious diseases usually become stable if no action is taken to control them and begin to decline once the disease is eliminated from available hosts.
But at the moment, it is impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen.
Zhong Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that if all countries are mobilized to implement the World Health Organization's recommendations on countermeasures to contain the virus outbreak, "the disease could be over by June".
Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine announced on 17 March that SARS-CoV-2 "will likely be around for one or two years".
According to research led by Neil Ferguson at Royal College, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is developed (possibly lasting 18 months or longer) ", according to research led by Neil Ferguson at Royal College.
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated "I think the likelihood of the coronavirus disappearing completely is low - because it is easily transmitted" and "it could become a seasonal disease if it recurred every year".
The severity of this recurrence will depend on collective immunity and mutation severity.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively nonspecific and infected individuals may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, chest discomfort, loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, tremor, vomiting, high blood pressure, diarrhea, and cyanosis. The World Health Organization has declared that approximately one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published a list of emergency symptoms: difficulty breathing, feeling of pain or persistent pressure in the chest cavity, sudden discomfort, difficulty waking, tingling of the face and lips; if these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention is recommended. Most progression of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and even death.
Some infected individuals may be asymptomatic, have no clinical signs, but the test results confirm their infection with the disease, so researchers have recommended that people who have had close contact with infected individuals should be carefully monitored and tested to prevent their infection.
Estimates by China of the rate of asymptomatic persons have varied from very low levels to 44%.
The typical period of naphthalgia (the time between onset of symptoms and onset of symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; in the most common case, it is five days. As an example of uncertainty, the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lose their sense of smell was initially 30% but later decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are yet to be determined.
It is thought that the disease is transmitted mainly through close contact and by small particles produced by coughing, sneezing or talking; and close contact means a distance of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 ft).
Research has shown that uncovered coughing can disperse small particles between 4.5 metres (15 ft) and 8.2 metres (27 ft).
Some research has suggested that the virus can be transmitted by small particles produced by talking and remaining in the air for long periods of time. Although the virus is not usually airborne, respiratory particles can be produced by breathing, including speaking.
These particles can be passed through the mouth or nose of people near the bed or through respiration to their lungs.
Certain medical procedures such as respiratory tubing and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can lead to airborne spraying of respiratory secretions and thus to the spread of disease in the air.
The disease is also transmitted when a person touches an infected surface, including skin, and then touches his or her eyes, nose or mouth.
While there are concerns about the possibility of transmission of disease through the implant, this risk is thought to be low.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.Although there is a possibility of transmission before symptoms and in later stages of disease, the highest rate of infection is within the first three days of symptoms.
People who have tested positive for the disease up to three days before symptoms appear indicate that transmission of the disease before significant symptoms appear is possible.
There have been few reports of asymptomatic cases that have been laboratory confirmed, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during communications tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) announced that although the rapid spread of the disease is not fully understood, usually one infected person can infect two or three others. The virus survives on different surfaces, from hours to days.
In particular, it has been shown to survive on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel surfaces for up to three days, on a matte surface for up to one day, and on copper for up to four hours.
However, these values can vary depending on humidity and temperature. To date, there has been some agreement on the positive outcome of testing for COVID-19 in pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, British authorities recommend that people wash their hands after contact with animals, as well as other surfaces that may have been touched by infected people.
Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus that was first identified in three individuals with pneumonia who came into contact with a group of people with acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All of the characteristics of the modern SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature in related coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that removes its protective coating. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
This is the hypothesis that the virus is of animal origin.
Genetic analysis showed that the coronavirus is genetically from the beta-corona virus species, subtype Sarcovirus (B) with two genes derived from bats.
The virus is 96 times more similar to other bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13) samples at the genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that between the pangolin viruses and humans, there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of their genome sequence.
Complete genome comparisons have concluded to date that up to 92% of the genetic material is shared between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that pangolins are mediating hosts.
Infection by a virus, temporarily, can be diagnosed by symptoms, however final confirmation is achieved by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) infection or CT imaging.
Research comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR and at the same time less specific because many of the characteristics of CT imaging overlap with other inflammatory lung diseases and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a screening or preliminary test for the diagnosis of COVID-19".
The World Health Organization has published several protocols for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on 17 January.
This test uses instantaneous reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be performed on respiratory and blood samples.
The results of this test are usually determined within a few hours to a few days.
Usually this test is done with a nasopharynx swab, however, a throat swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are working on serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these methods have been sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex for emergency use has only been validated by a few reputable laboratories.
Characteristic features of imaging in radiography and computed tomography (CT) of people with symptoms include asymmetrical granular pyramonium patterns and the presence of a lateral tracheal abrasion.
The Italian Association of Radiology is currently compiling an international online database of imaging findings from confirmed cases of the disease.
Unverified imaging by PCR, due to its overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, cannot be used specifically for the detection of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and found that although imaging is less specifically used to diagnose the disease, it is faster and more sensitive, and suggested that it be used as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Complex artificial intelligence-based neural networks have been developed to detect the imaging properties of the virus by both radiography and CT.
Some ways to prevent transmission include maintaining proper personal hygiene, washing hands, touching eyes, nose or mouth with sitting hands, and picking up towels when coughing or sneezing, and throwing towels directly in the trash.
Those who already have the disease are advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have banned or recommended non-essential travel to countries or regions where the disease is prevalent.
However, the virus has reached a community-level epidemic stage in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some people may not know where or how they became infected. People who provide health care to people who may be infected are advised to take standard precautions, contact precautions, and wear eye protection. Contact detection is one of the most important ways for health authorities to identify the source of contamination and prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have issued a statement to limit this type of surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been developed or proposed to be used on a voluntary basis, and by April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on solutions that do not violate privacy, such as using Bluetooth to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with a person with COVID-19.Many misconceptions about how to prevent the disease are spreading; for example, nasal or throat washing with a mouthwash are not effective.
Although many organizations are working to develop a vaccine, there is still no vaccine for COVID-19.
To prevent the spread of disease, hand washing is recommended.
The CDC recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after toileting or situations where hands are visibly dirty; before eating; after emptying the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because the virus is killed outside the human body by household soap, which removes the protective bubbles.
The CDC also recommends that in situations where soap and water are not readily available, alcohol-based disinfectants with a minimum alcohol content of 60% be used.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth with their hands seated.
Removal of contamination from surfaces is possible by various methods (one minute exposure to an antiseptic for the stainless steel surface), including 71-62% ethanol, 100-50% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 7.5-0.2% betadine.
Other methods, including benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there is a suspected or confirmed case of COVID in a facility such as a workplace or day care center, all areas such as offices, sanitary facilities, common areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touchpads, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations have recommended that people should cover their mouths and noses with a towel or a cloth when coughing or sneezing and throw away the towel immediately.
For people who are at risk of infection, surgical masks are recommended because wearing a mask can reduce the volume and distance of particulate matter that is dispersed when talking, sneezing or coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued guidelines on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce the desire to touch the face of people who are not following proper hand hygiene, which is a major source of infection".The use of a mask is also recommended for those who care for people who are suspected of having the disease.
The World Health Organization recommends that healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as those caring for people with COVID-19, however, they also confirm that wearing masks helps people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage members of the public to wear masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical masks made of fabric. China, in particular, recommends the use of disposable medical masks by healthy individuals, especially when in close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong has recommended that surgical masks be worn when using public transportation or stopping in crowded areas.
Thai health authorities are encouraging people to make masks using cloth, in the bathroom, and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going outdoors and from attending gatherings without wearing a mask or a mouth and nose mask.
On 16 March, Vietnam urged all people to wear masks when going out in public places, to protect themselves and others.
The Australian government has made masks mandatory for those visiting grocery stores.
Israel has required all its residents to wear masks when attending public gatherings.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks per day since mid-March, has made it mandatory for passengers on interurban trains and buses to wear masks from 1 April.
Panama has made wearing a mask compulsory when outdoors and has advised those who cannot afford to buy masks to make their own homemade masks.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes pollution control measures that aim to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
These practices include quarantines; restrictions on travel; closures of schools and workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
Individuals can implement these practices by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, greeting and questioning without contact and maintaining physical distance from others.
Currently, many governments have mandated or recommended social distancing in areas where the disease is prevalent.
The maximum recommended number of people to gather by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 (if there was no COVID-19 outbreak in the area) to 50 and then to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned gatherings of more than two people. Healthy people and those with underlying conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and immunodeficiency, such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and immunodeficiency, are at higher risk for serious complications and the CDC has recommended that these individuals stay as much as possible at home in areas where the disease is prevalent in the community. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health organizations began replacing the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clearly indicate that the goal is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social ties, both virtually and remotely.
The use of the term "social distancing" instead of encouraging people to maintain contact using alternative methods, implied that people should be in complete social isolation. Some officials issued guidelines on sexual hygiene for use during the pandemic.
The guidelines include recommendations to only have sex with the person you live with, someone who is not infected with the virus or who does not have symptoms of the virus.
For people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect infection, home quarantine is recommended.
Health organizations have specified detailed guidelines for proper self-quarantine. Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for all people living in areas affected by the virus.
The strictest personal quarantine guidelines have been issued for those in high-risk groups.
Those who may have been in contact with people with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region where the disease has spread widely are advised to observe a 14-day self-quarantine from the time of their last contact.
Disease control strategies include containment, suppression and mitigation.
Control is carried out in the early stages of an outbreak with the aim of tracking and isolating infected individuals, as well as introducing other measures to control the disease and vaccination to stop the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of disease, efforts are shifted to a mitigation strategy: measures are taken to reduce the incidence rate and to reduce the impact on health systems and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be implemented simultaneously.
More stringent measures to reverse pandemics require more stringent repression by reducing the number of baseline infections to less than 1.In addition to managing an outbreak of an infectious disease, an effort to reduce the pandemic packet is known as clearing the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of over-stress on health services and provides more time for the production and development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help manage the spread of the disease include personal preventive measures including hand hygiene, masks, self-quarantine; social measures aimed at physical distancing, including closing schools and cancelling events with large crowds; social engagement to encourage acceptance and compliance; and environmental measures such as cleaning surfaces. When the high intensity of the outbreak in China was identified, more stringent measures aimed at containment were taken, including the quarantining of entire cities and the implementation of strict travel bans.
Other countries have also implemented a series of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented group surveillance and local quarantine and issued warnings on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore has introduced financial support for infected individuals who self-quarantine and imposed severe penalties for those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of masks and imposed penalties for the confiscation of medical supplies. Simulations for the UK and the US show that the strategy of mitigation (reducing the spread of the epidemic, not stopping it) and containment (reversing the growth of the epidemic) are facing major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce peak health demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and put excessive pressure on health systems.
Suppression could be a better strategy, but it should be maintained as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is developed, if earlier), because if the measures are waived, the infection rate will quickly return to its previous levels.
Long-term intervention to curb a pandemic creates social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral drug for COVID-19, although efforts are underway to develop it, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking fluids and resting can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygenation therapy, intravenous fluid injection and respiratory aids may be required.
Steroid use can make the situation worse.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also announced "several traditional and home remedies" that could help relieve the symptoms of SARS-CoV-19.
The World Health Organization has described capacity building and adapting the health system to the needs of COVID-19 patients as one of the key measures to combat the outbreak.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to transfer resources to different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling unnecessary surgeries where possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 patients and increasing ICU capacity by training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are different opinions about where the first case (called patient zero) originated.
The first case of the novel coronavirus may have been reported on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over a period of one month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
Most of these individuals were associated with the Huan seafood wholesale market, which also sells live animals, and one theory is that the origin of the virus was a species of these animals; in other words, the virus is of animal origin. A group of people with pneumonia of unknown cause were observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported the matter to Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Police advised eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, to refrain from spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was punished by the superiors for issuing such a warning.
Subsequently, the Wuhan Municipal Sanitary Commission issued a public notice on 31 December and reported the matter to the World Health Organization.
A large number of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were reported to Wuhan health authorities, prompting them to begin investigations in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled, roughly every week and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China, due to travel related to the Chinese New Year and considering that Wuhan is one of the main transportation hubs and railway exchange hubs.
On 20 January 2020, China reported about 140 new cases, including one in Beijing and one in Shenzhen, in a single day.
The official next official data shows that 6,174 people had symptoms as of 20 January 2020.As of 26 March, the United States had the highest number of confirmed cases in the world, ahead of China and Italy.As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.31 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and 364,000 recovered.
About 200 countries and governmental territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries have restricted free movement and introduced border controls.
National responses included measures to contain the spread of disease including quarantine (known as the stay-at-home order, asylum order or home quarantine) and military rule. By 2 April, in the United States, about 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were under some form of home quarantine; in the Philippines, more than 50 million people, in South Korea about 59 million people, and in India 1.3 billion people were under some form of home quarantine.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world were under some form of quarantine, rising to 2.6 billion two days later - about one third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported on 1 December in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report states that the first case was on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian, on December 26, observed a group of people with pneumonia of unknown cause, which led the hospital to report the matter to Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Preliminary genetic testing on patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
On 31 December, a public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Sanitary Commission.
The World Health Organization was informed of the issue on the same day.
With the news, the police warned Wuhan doctors about "a rumor" about an outbreak.
The China National Sanitary Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a groundbreaking campaign titled "People's War" to contain the spread of the virus, which was later described by Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China.
In what has since been referred to as "the largest quarantine in human history", on 23 January a sanitary belt was identified that stopped entry and exit from Wuhan, extending to a total of 15 cities from Hubei Province, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
The use of a personal vehicle is prohibited in the city of Budapest.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
Officials also announced that a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, will be built and completed within 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital was built as Leishenshan Hospital to treat more patients.
In addition to newly constructed hospitals, China also converted 14 other buildings in Wuhan, including conference centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government launched other measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including sanitary declarations for travelers and an increase in the Spring Festival holidays.
Universities and schools were also closed across the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have initiated initiatives, particularly in the area of schools and universities.
Remote-working measures were initiated in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were imposed on entry and exit from Hubei.
Public transportation was reformed and museums across China were temporarily closed.
Public movement controls were implemented in many cities, and it is estimated that around 760 million people (more than half of the population) faced some form of restriction on their ability to go outside. In March, after the outbreak of the disease had reached a global stage, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "infiltration" of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. On 23 March, only one case was reported in mainland China five days before the arrival, when it occurred in a traveller returning from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the prevention of disease transmission within the country had been substantially addressed and the outbreak in China had been controlled.
On the same day, two months after the imposition of quarantine, travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, except for Wuhan. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March 2020 that entry to the country for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended after 28 March, and did not provide any details on when the implementation of this policy would end.
Those who wish to enter China will have to apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
China on 30 March encouraged businesses and factories to reopen, and offered monetary incentive packages for enterprises. The State Council announced that on 4 April, which coincides with the Day of the Pilgrims to the Tombs, there will be a public mourning and a three-minute national silence will begin at 10:00 a.m. However, the central government requested families to respect the state's actions online to observe physical distancing and to prevent the re-spread of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 had been transmitted to South Korea via China.
The National Health Administration reported on February 20 a significant increase in confirmed cases, mainly related to a gathering in Daegu belonging to a new religious movement called the Church of Christ.
It was thus thought that Shincheonji disciples who had come from Wuhan to Daegu were the source of the outbreak.
By 22 February, out of 9,336 churchgoers, 1,261 people, or about 13% of them, had reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest level of alert on 23 February.
On 28 February, more than 2000 confirmed cases in Korea were reported, rising to 3150 on 29 February.
Following the positive declaration of the three-drone test, all South Korean military bases were quarantined.
The airline program was also affected and changed as a result. South Korea introduced a population screening and isolation program that became known as the largest and most organized program in the world for population screening and isolation of all infected individuals, as well as tracking and quarantining people who had come into contact with them.
Screening methods include mandatory in-person symptom reporting for new international travellers through a mobile app, car-accessible testing centres with results determined on a daily basis, and an increase in testing capacity to 20,000 people per day.
The South Korean program, despite not quarantining the entire city, is considered one of the most successful programs in controlling the outbreak. South Korean society was initially polarized over President Moon Jae-in's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to clear Moon of what they called mismanagement of the state, while others praised his reaction.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest number of one-day infections in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that from 1 April, all travellers entering the country from abroad will be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests for assistance in virus testing from 121 different countries.
Iran reported the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection on 19 February in Qom, a city where, according to the Minister of Health and Medical Education, two people later died on the same day.
Initial measures announced by the government included cancellation of concerts and other cultural, sporting, sporting, and other events, Friday prayers, and closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani on 26 February 2020 said that there is no plan to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak and only individuals will be quarantined.
In March, plans to restrict inter-city travel were announced, however heavy inter-city traffic continued ahead of the Iranian New Year celebrations of Nowruz.
Shiite shrines in Qum until 16 March 2020, visited by visitors.In February, Iran became the epicenter of the outbreak after China.
Amid claims to conceal the true extent of the outbreak in Iran, as of 28 February, tracking of cases in more than ten countries showed that the origin of the outbreak was traced to Iran, suggesting that the true extent of the outbreak was probably more than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to date.
With the positive test results of 23 of 290 deputies on March 3, Iran's parliament was suspended.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called on officials of the Iranian Prison Administration to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, as well as all eligible prisoners, on a temporary basis.
The risk of spreading the virus is higher in confined spaces such as detention centers, which also lack adequate medical care, the Watch Tower said.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number in the country since the outbreak began.
By March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians or government officials were infected with the disease.
As of 23 March, Iran experienced 50 new coronavirus cases every hour and one new coronavirus death every 10 minutes.
According to a spokesperson for the World Health Organization, the probability of cases in Iran is five times greater than the number reported.
It is also thought that US sanctions against Iran may have negatively affected the country's financial capacity to deal with the outbreak of the virus.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for economic sanctions to be eased on countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, when two Chinese travellers in Rome tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, an outbreak of the disease was confirmed in Italy.
The number of cases began to rise sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to or from China and declare a state of emergency.
A series of unrelated COVID-19 cases were subsequently identified, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Cabinet announced a new legal order to contain the outbreak, which included the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different cities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: "In areas where the disease is prevalent, entry and exit will not be possible.
"On March 4 and with the death toll reaching 100, the Italian government ordered that all schools and universities throughout the country be completely closed.

As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 dead and 21,815 recovered in Italy, with most of these cases in Lombardy.
A CNN report suggested that the combination of two factors, a large population of older people and the inability to test all people who have been infected with the virus to date, could be effective in increasing mortality rates.
The UK response to the virus was one of the simplest among the countries affected by the disease, and as of 18 March 2020, the UK government had not imposed any social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government faced criticism for not responding with the proper speed and intensity to the concerns facing the society. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending that all non-essential travel and social contacts be cancelled, and urging people to work from home if possible and to avoid going to places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure facilities such as pubs and sports halls should be closed as soon as possible, and pledged to pay 80% of workers' wages up to a ceiling of £2,500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter measures on social distancing, banning gatherings of more than two people and imposing restrictions on travel and activity outside the home, which were deemed absolutely necessary.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforced by the police, by fines and by dispersing the rallies.
Most businesses were ordered to close, with the exception of those deemed "essential" including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and construction sites.

On 28 January 2020, the Centers for Disease Control - the principal public health agency of the United States government - announced that it had self-constructed a specific test kit.
Despite this, the United States had begun to test people slowly, which led to the ambiguity of the actual prevalence at the time.
The defective kits produced by the federal government, the non-approval of non-governmental test kits (produced by universities, companies and hospitals) by the federal government by the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for qualifying individuals for testing by early March (after which a doctor's prescription was required), all disrupted the process of testing individuals in February.

On the other hand, Chinese aid in parts of Latin America and Africa was well received. On 2 April, the World Bank launched an emergency support operation for developing countries.
The World Health Organization praised the efforts of Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
The World Health Organization pointed to the contrast between the 2004-2002 SARS outbreak and the current crisis, noting that at the time, Chinese officials were accused of covertly preventing successful efforts to prevent and contain the disease, but in the current crisis, the central government "regularly provided updates to ensure that no violence was created in the run-up to the Lunar New Year holiday".
On 23 January, Gauden Galea, the WHO representative in response to the central officials' decision to ban transportation in Wuhan, Gauden Galea, Gauden Galea, said that while the decision "certainly does not meet the recommendations of the World Health Organization", it "is a very important sign of commitment to contain the epidemic in the most concentrated area of disease", calling it "an unprecedented decision in the history of public health".On 30 January, after confirming human-to-human transmission outside China and an increase in the number of cases in other countries, the World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency (PHEIC) in the sixth PHEIC since the first declaration of the situation in 2009 in the context of the influenza pandemic.
World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was declared because of "the risk of a global outbreak of disease, especially in low- and middle-income countries that lack robust health systems".
Tedros, in response to the travel restrictions, said "there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and "the World Health Organization does not recommend restricting trade and movement".
On 5 February, the World Health Organization, citing the need to support low-income countries that "lack systems to detect people who have the virus, even if symptoms do emerge", appealed to the global community for $675 million to invest in strategic preparedness in these countries.
Tedros further stated in statements that "we are only as strong as the weakest member of our own body" and appealed to the international community to "either invest today or spend more later".On 11 February, the World Health Organization, at a press conference, named the disease COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros announced that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to "consolidate the power of the entire UN system to combat this disease".
As a result, a crisis management team was activated at the United Nations to coordinate all UN response efforts, the World Health Organization announced that this team would allow them to "focus on health-related disease response while other organizations, using their expertise, address the broader social, economic and developmental implications of the outbreak".
On 14 February, a joint operational team led by the World Health Organization with China was activated to assist in internal management and assessment of "severe and contagious disease" by establishing World Health Organization and international experts in China, by hosting workshops and holding meetings with key national institutions, and by conducting field visits to assess "impact of countering activities at provincial and municipal levels, including urban and rural areas".On 25 February, the World Health Organization announced that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic", and also announced: "While it is still too early to call this pandemic, countries should be "in a state of preparedness".
The World Health Organization (WHO) sent a joint operational team to Iran in response to the spread of the disease outbreak in Iran. On 28 February, WHO officials announced that the global coronavirus threat assessment had been increased from "high" to "very high", the highest level of warning and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Programme, warned in a statement that "this is a real test for all the governments on the planet: wake up.
The virus may be on the way and you must be prepared", stressing that the right response measures can prevent the "worst case" from occurring in the world.
Ryan also stated that current data has not yet empowered public health authorities to declare a global pandemic, and stressed that the declaration of a global pandemic means that "we have basically accepted that every human on the planet is at risk of contracting the virus".
On 11 March, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization said that "the WHO is deeply concerned, both at the alert level of the outbreak and its severity and at the alert level of the lack of adequate action".The WHO faced much criticism for the inadequate management of the pandemic, including the delayed declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
These negative reactions included the signing of a petition to resign WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, which, as of 6 April, had been signed by 733,000 people.
On 26 March 2020, the ten UN human rights experts underlined the need to respect the rights of all people during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts stated that everyone deserves intervention to save their life and that this is the responsibility of the state.
The group of experts stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should not be used as a justification for discrimination against a particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone, including persons with disabilities, minority groups, the elderly, forced internally displaced persons, homeless people, people living in very poor conditions, people in detention, as well as refugees and other non-individual groups in need of state support, has the right to security.
International governmental organisations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on counter-policy in countries around the world, as well as to provide insights and recommendations in this area.
The Digital Centre provides policies to strengthen the global health system and economy to counter the negative impacts of lockdowns and travel restrictions, and includes a policy review component aimed at helping countries learn from each other and facilitating a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has been criticized for its handling of the pandemic that began in Hubei province, China, by the United States, British Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove, and Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.
A number of provincial-level directors of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed due to mismanagement of quarantine in central China, in a sign of dissatisfaction with the way the political establishment was handling the outbreak in these areas.
Some analysts believe that the move is aimed at keeping Communist Party of China General Secretary Xi Jinping safe from public outrage over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, including Zhao Lijian, have denied their previous confirmation of the origin of the coronavirus outbreak from Wuhan and have put forward conspiracy theories about whether COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
The Trump administration dubbed the coronavirus "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" and declared that "Chinese censorship has exacerbated the virus and turned it into a global pandemic", a speech that was criticized by some critics as racist and "an attempt to divert public opinion from the government's failure to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast obtained some U.S. government intelligence that described a media ploy that clearly originated with the National Security Council and was titled "Everything relates to China".
We were told to try and convey this message by any means possible, including press conferences and TV appearances".Media outlets including Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries where the virus has spread are part of a propaganda push for global influence".
Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, warned that "there is a component of geopolitics that involves an attempt to influence through news rotation and politics of generosity".
Borrell also said that "China wants to convey with the utmost determination the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner".
China also reportedly sent aid to Venezuela and Iran, while urging the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran.
On April 3, US sanctions prevented the shipment of 100,000 Jack Ma donated masks to Cuba.
American officials were also accused of transferring aid sent from other countries into their own country.
Disagreements over masks were also reported between various countries such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey confiscated hundreds of ventilators intended for Spain in the Boer War.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of EU solidarity with Italy, which had suffered severe negative impacts from the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the EU said "only China has responded.
This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity".
On 22 March, Russian President Vladimir Putin, following a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, sent the Russian Army a draft of military medicines, special disinfectant vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa, quoting an anonymous "high-level political source", reported that 80 percent of Russian aid was "useless or useless to Italy".
The source accused Russia of initiating a "geopolitical and diplomatic" manifestation.
Attilio Fontana, President of Lombardy, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected the media report and expressed their appreciation for the aid.
Russia also sent a cargo plane carrying medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said "Putin, while sending aid to American partners, believes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are reinforced and ready to move, they will be able to compensate if necessary".
The NATO-planned Defender 2020 exercise in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, the largest NATO military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a more limited scale.
Kate Hudson, Secretary General of the Campaign to End Nuclear Disarmament, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise, saying "In the current public health crisis, the exercise not only endangers the lives of the United States military and many participating European countries, but also the lives of the residents of the countries where the exercise is being conducted".With the exception of 20 MPs as well as 15 current or former political figures, the Iranian state has been severely affected by the virus.
Hassan Rouhani, President of Iran, on March 14, 2020, wrote a general letter to world leaders, urging them to help, stating that his country is struggling to combat the outbreak due to lack of access to global markets as a result of the U.S. sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has prompted requests to the United States to adopt social policies common in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child care, family leave with rights and higher levels of public health budget.
Political analysts have predicted that the outbreak could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
After Japan announced that anyone coming to Japan from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at government-designated locations, South Korea criticized Japan's "vague and passive quarantine efforts".
South Korean society was initially polarized over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to clear Moon of what they called mismanagement of the state, and others praised his reaction. The pandemic allowed countries to pass emergency laws in response.
Some analysts have expressed concern that the pandemic could allow governments to cling more to power.
The Hungarian parliament allowed Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to legislate indefinitely, suspend parliament and elections, and punish those who appear to have spread false information about the virus and how the state crisis was being managed.
The main outbreak of the coronavirus is due to several resource shortages due to increased use of equipment to combat the outbreak, nervous purchases and disruption of logistics and manufacturing operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and supply disruption.
Several places have also witnessed nervous shopping, which has led to shelves being emptied of essentials such as food, toilet paper and mineral water, creating a sense of resource scarcity.
In particular, the tech industry has warned of delays in the shipment of electronic goods.
According to Tedros Adhanom, Director-General of the World Health Organization, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to higher prices of medicines to the equivalent of 20 per cent of the normal price and delayed the supply of medical goods by four to six months.
It has also led to shortages of personal protective equipment around the world, and the World Health Organization has warned that this will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products to China.
This activity led to a shortage of dried milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region and the subsequent high demand for food, both regions have been spared severe food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy to combat monopoly and illicit trade in essential products have been successful, preventing the severe food shortages that were foreseen in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with significant agricultural production, has not experienced severe shortages, but according to industry representatives, prices may rise.
Even in the city of Wuhan, it was only occasionally observed that food shelves were emptied and Chinese government officials put up pork stocks on the market to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy which require food producers to have stocks in place for such emergencies.
The impact on the global economy has been felt in China: According to media reports on 16 March, China's economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020, due to measures taken by the government to curb the virus outbreak and drastically reduce retail sales by 20.5%, according to media reports on 16 March.
As mainland China is one of the world's leading economies and manufacturing hubs, the virus outbreak is a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais from the Economist Information Unit predicts that until a clearer picture is drawn of the possible consequences of the current situation, the market will remain volatile.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the negative economic consequences of the epidemic on global growth could be greater than those of the 2004-2002 SARS outbreak.
One expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimates that the negative impact on global supply chains could be worth more than $300 billion and could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reportedly "closing" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to a fall in demand from China.
The global stock markets collapsed on 24 February due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On 27 February, due to increased concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, various US stock market indices including the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced their sharpest fall since 2008 with the Dow falling by 1191 points, the largest one-day drop since the 08-2007 economic crisis.
All three indicators ended the week with a fall of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH, confirmed China's top credit rating but retained its negative view.
Stock markets once again fell due to fears of coronavirus, with the biggest drop occurring on March 16.
Many see a recession as a likely possibility.
Mohamed El-Erian, an economist, praised the emergency measures and the central banks and governments.
Central banks are reacting more quickly than in the 2008 financial crisis.
Due to travel bans, closures of public places including tourist attractions and government advice to refrain from all travel around the world, tourism is one of the sectors that has suffered the most.
As a result, many airlines including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas cancelled their flights due to reduced demand and the regional airline Flybe in the UK was shut down.
The negative impact of the virus on the cruise industry has been unprecedented.
Several train stations and shipping ports were also closed.
The pandemic coincided with Chunyun, one of the main travel seasons and associated with the Chinese New Year holidays.
A number of events, including crowded New Year's Eve festivals, were cancelled by national or regional governments, and private companies including Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland permanently closed their stores and tourist attractions.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple exhibitions, were closed to prevent large gatherings.
In 24 cases from 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, authorities extended the New Year holidays until 10 February and often ordered workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong raised the infectious disease control level to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled New Year celebrations. Reduced store hours or temporary closures have hurt the retail sector worldwide.
The number of customers in retail stores in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retail stores in North America and the Middle East saw a 60-50% drop in reviews.
The outbreak also led to a 43-33% decrease in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Major shopping center operators around the world have taken other measures, including increasing hygiene, installing temperature scanners to check the body temperature of shoppers, and cancelling events. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession created by the pandemic could push between 14 and 22 million people in Latin America into extreme poverty if it were not for the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the pandemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
A large portion of the population of about 300 million rural migrant workers were trapped in the interior provinces, in their own homes, or in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to forecasts by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus outbreak could affect 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could rise by up to 32%. Vacations in India have resulted in the unemployment of tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who were paid daily wages). A survey by the Angus Reid Foundation found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some form of unemployment. In Spain, about 900,000 workers have lost their jobs since businesses closed in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a comprehensive credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have sent their workers to short-term state-subsidised work schemes known as Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term work compensation scheme has also been implemented by France and the UK.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have also been deeply affected by the pandemic, with both the operations and human resources of relevant organisations - both employed and independent - affected worldwide.
Organisations active in the field of culture and the arts have tried to continue to fulfil their mission (often financed by state budget) of ensuring public access to cultural heritage, protecting the safety of their workers and supporting artists where possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, exhibition halls and other cultural institutions around the world, to varying degrees, were closed indefinitely and their exhibitions, events and performances were cancelled or postponed.
Instead, more efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent rapidly accelerating consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious ceremonies, major sporting events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced problems. The Vatican announced that the Holy Week ceremonies in Rome, which are held during the last week of Lent and Christian penance, have been canceled.
Many bishops in power have advised older Christians to stay home on Sundays rather than attend the Lord's Supper; some churches have made church services available via radio, live online broadcasting or television, and others have made it possible to attend services by car.
The Roman Catholic bishop-general has closed his churches and places of worship, and St. Peter's Square has been cleared of Christian pilgrims, while other religious institutions have also canceled services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and churches.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak, and the shrines were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and residents to the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has created the most disruption to the worldwide sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, 2020 Euro, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season have either been cancelled or postponed.
The outbreak of the disease has complicated the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event "will be rescheduled for a historic date further than 2020, at the latest for summer 2021".Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have been closed, and live poker tournaments have either been cancelled or postponed.
This has led many gamblers to turn to online gambling sites, with many gambling sites reporting a significant increase in their own registration rates. The entertainment industry has also been hit, and many bands have suspended or cancelled their concert tours.
Many major theaters, including Broadway, have also cancelled all shows.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue producing and sharing artworks via the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, including live broadcast concerts or the creation of web-based "festivals" for artists to perform, distribute and promote their work.
In the online space, many internet memes have been circulated on the topic of coronavirus, many of which deal with humor and various issues amidst the uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an increase in discrimination, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, as well as people at risk of disease in Europe, the United States and other countries.
In many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia-Pacific, there have been cases of fear, suspicion and hostile behaviour.
Reports from February (when most cases were still confined to China) indicate a resurgence of racist sentiments among various groups around the world about whether the Chinese people deserve the virus or are facing justified punishment.
Some countries in Africa also witnessed rising anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support has been provided to the Chinese people, both online and offline, from those in the virus-affected areas.
After the spread of the disease to other countries, the people of Italy, the first European country to experience a serious COVID-19 outbreak, also came under suspicion and alien fear. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed leaflets banning Chinese from entering their country in an effort to stop the outbreak.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
Chinese nationals, as well as other Asians in the UK and the US, reported increased rates of racist insults and self-harm.
US President Donald Trump was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term that was seen by critics as racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan and on their way to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from the northeastern part of India bordering China, who were studying in the main cities of India, experienced harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, state president of Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, declared that the Chinese have destroyed nature and "for this reason, God has taken revenge on them".
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta and called "disgraceful". In China, the pandemic fueled xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, with foreigners being labeled "foreign trash" and targeted for "throwing out".
Many paid-for newspapers have removed subscription fees for all or part of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific articles related to the outbreak freely available.
Some scientists quickly shared their results on pre-release servers such as bioRxiv.

Testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR if RNA detects the coronavirus.
This test is specialized and only detects the SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus.
This test is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Serology can be used both for diagnosis and for population monitoring.
The pathogenesis test shows how many people have been infected by including people who have very mild symptoms and have not reported or have no symptoms at all.
Using the results of this test, the precise mortality rate and collective immunity levels in the population can be determined.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country has reliable data on the prevalence of the disease in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were significant variations in the number of tests performed between countries.
This difference is likely to significantly affect the reported case mortality rate, which may be overestimated in some countries.
The test, which uses instantaneous reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) momentum, can be performed on respiratory samples taken by various methods including nasopharynx swabs or mixed samples.
The results of this test are usually determined within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing, when performed with swab glucose, provides reliable results only in the first week of disease.
After that, the virus can disappear from the throat, while it is replicating in the lungs.
For infected individuals tested in week two, alternative samples can be taken from the deep respiratory tract by suction catheter or the possibility of using a mixture of surfactants is also possible.
One of the first PCR test samples was developed in January 2020 at Charité in Berlin using instantaneously generated reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis of 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
England also developed a test method by 23 January 2020. South Korea's Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus) clinical diagnostic kit on 28 January 2020.
The kit searches for the "E" gene, which is common in all beta-coronavirus viruses, and the RdRp gene, which is specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval of the SARS-CoV-2 virus PCR-based diagnostic kit from the China National Medical Products Organization.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) instantaneous RT-PCR diagnostic panel among public health laboratories through International Reagent Resource.
One of three genetic tests in previous versions of the test kit had inconclusive results due to defective identifiers and limitations of the test at the CDC in Atlanta; this led to the successful processing of an average of less than 100 samples per day throughout February.
As of February 28, 2020, testing using two components was not recognized as reliable diagnostic until after state and local laboratories were allowed to test.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. US commercial laboratories began conducting the test in early March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced that RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing is available nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics also similarly made COVID-19 testing available nationwide from 9 March 2020.
No restrictions were announced on the number of tests; sampling and processing should be done according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, the production and development of the COVID-19 test kit was carried out by the National Centre for Virology and Biotechnology Research VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service Center for Health Supervision. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic had developed a test for COVID-19 disease. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in high volumes within 3.5 hours, allowing one device to perform approximately 4,128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the m2000 system to Abbott Laboratories; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received the EUA approval from the FDA for a 45-minute trial.
The FDA has approved a trial using isothermal nucleic acid amplification instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide a positive result within only five minutes and a negative result within 13 minutes.
Approximately 18,000 of these devices are currently in the United States, and Abbott expects to be able to deliver 50,000 tests per day with increased production.A test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleopeptide protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan and hopes to provide results within 15 to 20 minutes, as accurate as a rapid influenza test.
A review of research conducted in March 2020 concluded that "Radiographs of the chest cavity have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT findings can be detected even before symptoms appear".
Common features in CT include a matte glass double-lobed polylobula with lateral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
The disease progresses with subgenital overgrowth, defective coating and stiffness.
Research comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, the current pandemic outbreak, suggests that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR and at the same time less specific, as many of the imaging features of CT are overlapping with other inflammatory lung diseases and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a screening or early test for the diagnosis of COVID-19".As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for early screening.
Part of the immune system's response to this infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These pathogens can be used to diagnose infection in individuals 7 days or more after onset of symptoms, to assess immunity, and to monitor population. This test can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or through a patient-centered clinical trial (PoCT).
High capacity automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the productivity of each system.
For CLT, a sample of ambient blood is usually used, although it is possible to use multiple samples in succession to track the immune system response.
For PoCT, a blood sample is usually taken by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, the extraction phase is not required before testing. On 26 March 2020, the FDA released a list of 29 entities that, as requested, had notified the organization and were therefore now able to distribute their own antibody tests.
On 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun and Epitope Diagnostics, the medical diagnostic laboratories, obtained European approval for their own test kits. These kits could detect IgG and IgA antibodies that were screened against the virus and present in a blood sample.
The test has a capacity of a few hundred samples within a few hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional PCR test for detecting viral RNA.
These shoes are usually diagnosable 14 days after the onset of illness. In early April, England found that none of the shoes test kits it had purchased were adequately used.
Hong Kong implemented a scheme whereby suspected patients can stay at home, "Emergency Department will give the patient a sample tube", the patient will take saliva from his or her mouth, return it and receive the test results some time later. NHS UK announced that it is piloting a scheme to test suspected cases at home, which will eliminate the risk of infecting others if the patient is admitted to hospital, as well as if the ambulance is used and the need for disinfection. In centres where it is possible to bring in a vehicle for testing suspected cases of COVID-19, a healthcare professional will take appropriate measures to collect samples, taking precautions.
Self-driving testing centres have enabled South Korea to operate one of the fastest and most extensive testing practices in comparison to other countries. In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians announced on 2 March that it has a capacity of 12,000 tests per day on-site, with 10,700 people tested in the previous week.
If the test is ordered by a doctor, the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to a spokesperson for Robert Kuh Foundation Chairman, Germany has a total capacity to perform 160,000 tests per week.
From 19 March, the possibility of testing by car was provided in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was not known because only positive results were reported.
A laboratory questionnaire indicated that by the 12/2020 calendar week, a total of at least 483,295 samples had been tested by the end of week 12/2020, with 33,491 samples (6.9%) being positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for testing 64 patients simultaneously, by combining samples and then performing further tests only if the combined sample was positive.In Wuhan, on February 5, 2020, a temporary emergency diagnostic laboratory with an area of 2,000 square meters called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: 火眼 or "fire eye") was inaugurated by BGI with a capacity to process 10,000 samples per day.
The 5-day construction of the lab, overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian, overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian, showed that if the testing capacity was not fully utilized, the number of cases in Wuhan would increase by 47% and the cost of quarantine would double.
Similar prototypes of Wuhan laboratories called Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately launched in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
By 4 March 2020, the total daily capacity reached 500,000 tests per day. Open-text and composite designs, which were distributed by Origami Tests, can test 1,122 patient samples using only 93 COVID-19 test kits. These balanced designs are feasible in small laboratories and without the need for a robotic fluid tester.
By March, shortages and the lack of sufficient quantities of the identified material had become an obstacle to large-scale testing in Europe, the UK and the USA.
This has led some authors to consider sample preparation protocols, which involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes, to free up the RNA genome for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the UAE is now testing a large number of its population for coronavirus, more than any other country per capita, and is therefore achieving success in achieving a major segment of its population.
This was made possible by the feasibility of automated testing and the purchase of a large laboratory on a country-wide population scale from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency diagnostic laboratories in China).
The lab, which was built in 14 days, is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this scale to operate outside China.
Different test protocols targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization used the German manual to prepare and send to low-importing countries that do not have the resources to produce internal kits.
The German test kit guidelines were published on 17 January 2020. As the protocol prepared by the US Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, the delay in the start of testing in the United States was caused by the lack of availability of the protocol by the US Centers for Disease Control. China and the United States had difficulties with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries, together with Australia, were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and resources recommended by health experts for testing.
In contrast, experts say that widespread availability of testing in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The capacity to conduct tests, mainly in private sector laboratories, has been built up by the South Korean government over the past few years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for strengthened testing schedules as the best way to slow the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has caused hundreds of thousands of tests at private laboratories in the US to be delayed and stockpiles of swabs and chemical identifiers to become scarce.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its own test kits.
In the United States, test kits produced by the CDC were "defective". The government then tolerated bureaucratic barriers from conducting private tests. Spain purchased the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the test results were not accurate.
The company explained that incorrect results may result from difficulty in collecting samples or improper use of kits.
The Spanish minister announced that he would not use the kits that give incorrect results and would replace them with a different test kit produced by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic had purchased from China had incorrect results.Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that gave incorrect results.
Prime Minister Mateş Matović suggested that the kits be poured into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey purchased from China had "high error rates" and were "not considered usable".The UK government purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that the kits were not usable.
Testing followed by quarantine of people who tested positive and tracking of those who had contact with people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 has had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, where the first COVID-19 deaths in Italy occurred at the time, conducted two rounds of testing at ten days' intervals on a total population of approximately 3,400 people.
About half of those who tested positive had no symptoms and all positive cases were quarantined.
By restricting travel to public centres, new infections are completely eliminated.
With strict contact tracking, restrictions, testing and quarantining of incoming travellers, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was much slower than in other developed countries, though without severe restrictions such as mandatory closures of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events were cancelled and Singapore advised residents to stay home on 28 March, but schools reopened after the holidays, on 23 March, at their own designated time.
Several other countries, including Iceland and South Korea, also managed the pandemic with strict contact tracing, restrictions, testing and quarantining of incoming travellers, albeit with fewer lockdowns.
A statistical study found that countries with more tests per foot had much lower mortality rates, possibly because these countries were better able to diagnose those with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization recommends that countries without testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative samples of their COVID-19 test to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation.
Of these 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 is in North America and 1 is in Australia.
In the chart below, the column "% positive to total tests" is influenced by each country's testing policy.
If all other conditions are similar, the "% positive to total tests" will be higher in a country that tests only those admitted to hospitals than in a country that tests all citizens regardless of whether they have symptoms.
Hand washing, also sometimes referred to as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands in order to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap and soap consistently at "sensitive sites" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhoea and fecal-disease-transmitted diseases.
For example, if people do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes), they may develop respiratory diseases such as influenza or colds.
Five important times during the day when handwashing with soap is important are: before and after going to the bathroom, after cleaning the baby or changing the diaper, before feeding the baby, before eating, and before and after preparing food or touching raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, wash your hands with a washcloth. The World Health Organization recommends handwashing for the following:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the baby after using the toilet.
After a fan, cough or sneeze.
After touching animals, animal waste or feeding animals.
Hand hygiene from medical point of view, refers to hygienic measures related to medical practices.
Washing hands before administering medication or medical care can prevent or minimize transmission of disease.
The main purpose of handwashing is to clean hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other disease-causing microorganisms) and chemicals that can cause danger or disease.
This is particularly important for people who work with food or in medical-related occupations, but also for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious agents of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
And reduce the rate of infant mortality during home birth.
A 2013 study suggested that improvements in handwashing practices may lead to a slight improvement in the height and growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, mortality rates from respiratory diseases and childhood diarrhoea can be reduced by promoting simple changes such as handwashing with soap.
This simple measure could reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Measures that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhoea incidence by about one third, comparable to providing clean water in low income areas.
A 48% reduction in diarrhea cases could be linked to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap as an automatic behavior that has become a habit in homes, schools and communities around the world is the only, most effective and cheapest way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory infection, is one of the leading causes of death in children under 5 years of age, causing the death of about 1.8 million children annually.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together cause the deaths of about 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, replacing hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet with a firm habit could save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, cut deaths from diarrhea by almost half and reduce deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter, compared to any other vaccine or medical intervention.
Handwashing is usually integrated with other sanitary interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Handwashing also protects against yellow fever infection if transmitted through direct physical contact.
One of the harmful effects of small-scale handwashing is that frequent handwashing can lead to drying of the skin and consequent damage to the skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can lead to skin itching, also known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among healthcare workers.
Excessive and frequent hand-washing is also cited as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Five important times during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of faecal-oral disease are: after going to the toilet (faecal), after cleaning the baby (diaper removal), before feeding the baby, before eating, and before and after preparing food or touching raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other cases where proper handwashing practices should be considered to prevent transmission of disease include before and after treating a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or sneezing; after touching animal waste or animals; and after contact with waste.
In many countries, the rate of handwashing with soap is very low.
A 2015 study of handwashing in 54 countries found that on average, 38.7% of households in 54 countries had adopted the habit of handwashing with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of soap-washing with soap at 97%, the United States was in the middle at 77%, and China was in the bottom at 23%. There are currently several ways to change the pace to increase soap-washing at critical times.
The basic health care programmes implemented by the Philippine Ministry of Education are an example of a wide-ranging initiative to improve the health and education of children.
Twice a year, the sterilization of mosquitoes, with daily handwashing with soap, daily fluoridation of teeth, is the main focus of the national programme.
In Indonesia, the programme has also been successfully implemented.
The addition of soap or a soap-based detergent to water is effective in eliminating microorganisms from the skin.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce solubility barriers and increase solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient cleanser for the skin because the fats and proteins that are part of organic soil do not easily dissolve in water.
However, flowing a sufficient amount of water helps in the purification.
Solid soap, due to its recyclability, may retain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies that have investigated the transmission of bacteria contaminated by solid soap have concluded that bacterial transmission by this method seems unlikely because the bacteria are washed away by soap.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still believes that "liquid soap is better if it is accessible without direct contact".
Antibacterial soaps for people who care about hygiene have been heavily promoted.
To date, there is no evidence that pesticides or pesticides are effective in killing antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps containing common antibacterial agents such as triclosan are not, and a wide variety of organisms are resistant to them.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not combined with Ben Brundt's antibacterial soaps, these soaps may not be as effective as they are marketed.
Advanced formulations in addition to surfactants and skin protective agents may contain acid (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a pH regulator, benzoic acid, antimicrobial active benzoic acid, and other skin softeners (aloe vera, vitamin, menthol, herbal extract). A comprehensive analysis by the Oregon State University School of Public Health found that ordinary soap is as effective as ordinary antibacterial soap containing triclosan in preventing disease and killing hand bacteria.
Hot water used for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 degrees Celsius).
However, hot soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water at removing natural lubricants, which contain dust and bacteria.
Despite this, and contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of hot water does not have an effect on the reduction of microbial load on the hands.
Hand sanitizer is a non-water-based sanitary material.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, water-based non-alcoholic hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based disinfectants or hand disinfectants) became popular.
Most are made of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) and made in the form of a gel, or for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol, a diluent such as glycerin is used and made in the form of a liquid or a cup.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide increases most antimicrobial activity. Antiparasitics containing at least 60 to 95 percent alcohol are effective microbicides.
Alcohol-containing disinfectants kill bacteria, including drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, tuberculosis, RSV, rhinovirus, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, influenza and hepatitis), and fungi.
Hand sanitizers containing 70% alcohol, 30 seconds after use, kill 99.97% (ca.3.5 log equivalent to 35 decibels) of hand bacteria, and 1 minute after use, kill 99.99% to 99.999% (ca.4 to 5 log). Hand sanitizers have been effective against bacteria but less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against Norwalk (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of gastrointestinal infectious disease. Sufficient amounts of hand sanitizer or alcohol-containing gel should be used to keep both hands fully moistened or covered.
The back and sides of both hands, the middle and the ends of all fingers should be lubricated for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
The fingertips should also be thoroughly washed by rubbing the toenails with both hands. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention strongly recommends hand washing over hand sanitizer, especially when hands are thoroughly dirty.
The use of these materials is increasingly increasing due to their ease of use and their ability to quickly kill microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper handwashing unless soap and water are available.
Repeated use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless softeners or skin moisturizers are added to their formulations.
Adding glycerin or other emollients to their formula can reduce or eliminate the drying effect of alcohol.
In clinical trials, hand sanitizers containing alcohol and softeners caused significantly less inflammation and dryness of the skin than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact allergy syndrome or sensitivity to alcohol or additives in alcohol-containing hand sanitizers, rarely occurs.
The lower likelihood of contact dermatitis compared to washing hands with soap and water made them attractive.
Despite their effectiveness, water-based non-water-based materials do not clean hands of organic materials, but rather make them anti-infectious.
This is why hand sanitizers such as soap and water are not as effective in preventing the spread of many diseases, as pathogens still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on their ingredients and formulation and has historically been less effective than alcohol-containing hand sanitizers.
It has recently been shown that formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have more cumulative and persistent antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohols whose effectiveness is reduced after repeated use, possibly due to adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot make soap and use ash or dust instead.
Ash or dust may be more effective than water alone, but may have less effect than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the incidence of disease rather than slowing the spread of disease.
Ash, like soap, is an anti-pesticide, because it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
If soap is lacking, the World Health Organization recommends ash or diamond as a substitute for soap.
The correct handwashing method recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with hot or cold running water.
Flowing water is recommended because the water in the reservoir may be contaminated. This is when the water temperature does not seem to change.
Wash your hands with a sufficient amount of soap and water, including the back of the hand, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap kills germs on the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using only water.
Keep your hands clean for at least 20 seconds.
Handwashing creates friction and helps to remove germs from the skin, and handwashing for longer periods of time kills more germs.
Wash your hands thoroughly with running water.
Washing your hands in cold water can re-infect your hands.
Dry with a clean towel or let air dry.
Wet and wet hands can easily become infected. The most common parts of the hand that remain sitting are the thumb, wrist, the areas between the fingers of the hand and the under nails.
Artificial nails and cut-to-nail lacquer may be a hiding place for microorganisms.
A moisturizer is often recommended to prevent dry hands. Dry skin leads to skin lesions and can increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are various low-cost options for facilitating handwashing in developing countries where tap water or soap is not available. For example, pouring water from a gallon or a perforated container into a vacuum or using ash if necessary. In situations where water resources are limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, such as "tap water or small water lighters" and other low-cost options.
Tip-tap is a simple technology consisting of a rope-suspended container and a foot-controlled lever for pouring a small amount of water onto the hands and a soap mold.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public toilets.
A growing volume of research suggests that paper towels are much healthier than the electric dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study supported by the paper towel industry, the European Textile Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster in London to compare the hygiene of paper towels, hot air dryers and more modern jet air dryers.
After washing and drying the hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria present on the fingertips increased on average by 194% and the number of bacteria present on the palms of the hands by 254%.
Drying hands with a jet air dryer led to an increase in the average total number of bacteria present in the fingertips by 42% and in the palms of the hands by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria decreased on average by 76% on the fingertips and 77% on the palms of the hands. The scientists also conducted experiments to determine whether there was a risk of cross-pollination of contamination between other toilet users and the washroom environment due to the use of different hand drying methods.
The jet-air dryer, which claims to blow air out at 180 metres per second (650 km/h or 400 mph), is capable of sucking microorganisms from hands and devices and potentially contaminates other people using the toilet as well as the toilet environment up to 2 metres away.
Using a hot air dryer, it can disperse microorganisms up to 0.25 m away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not cause the spread of significant microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were investigated.
The following changes were observed in a number of bacteria after drying hands:
There are a large number of manufacturers of hand dryer and hand dryer hand dryers have been compared to paper towels.
If soap and water are not available during travel, handwashing with hand sanitizer towels can be used as an alternative.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Shortly after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis (1846) discovered the effectiveness of medical hand-holding in preventing infection in hospital settings, medical hand-holding became mandatory.
There are electronic devices that can remind hospital staff if they forget to wash their hands.
One study showed that the rate of infection was reduced by using them.
The time required for medical handwashing is at least 15 seconds, with sufficient soap and water or gel, and all parts of the hand are lubricated.
Hands should be tied and fingers should be folded.
If there is a crease under the nails, a brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water on hands, it is important that hands are well watered and dried with a clean towel.
After hand drying, a paper towel should be used to close the water bottle (and, if necessary, to open the exit door).
This prevents re-contamination of the hands by contact with the surfaces.
The goal of handwashing in treatment centers is to kill pathogenic microorganisms ("microbes") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that non-washing of hands is unacceptable in most hospital settings, with many doctors and nurses often forgetting to wash their hands before contact with patients, thus causing the transmission of microorganisms.
One study found that proper handwashing and other simple procedures can reduce up to 66% of catheter-related bloodstream contamination. The World Health Organization has published a paper that represents the standard handwashing and hand-washing practices in healthcare settings.
The draft Hand Hygiene Guide produced by the organisation is also publicly available on its website.
A related study was carried out by Whitby et al.
If it is necessary to prove compliance with the prescribed regulations, commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene levels.
The World Health Organization has identified "five times" for hand washing:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
before undertaking activities related to disinfection, and
After the patient is taken care of. Adding anti-infectious chemicals to soap (soaps "medicinal" or "anti-microbial") enhances the lethal properties of the hand-washing agent.
Such measures may be considered before surgery or in an environment where antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly prevalent. To wash hands before surgery, the following are required: a water bottle that can be opened and closed without direct contact, a chlorhexidine or toothpaste detergent, sterile towels to dry hands after washing, and a sterile hand brush and other sterile devices to clean the undernails.
All jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires that the hand and wrist be cleaned to the finger for usually 2-6 minutes.
Long sessions (10 min) are not necessary.
When watering, use your hands to prevent water from returning.
After handwashing is completed, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and surgical clothing is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands thoroughly or use hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it has been noted that the greatest benefit from handwashing is achieved from 20% of the first six hours, and when the frequency of handwashing reaches more than 35%, the additional benefit is very small.
A 30-second comparison of handwashing with an alcohol-based solution with handwashing with an antibacterial soap showed that handwashing reduced the bacterial contamination balance by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
However, the use of soap and water is more effective than alcohol-based handwashing in reducing the H1N1 influenza virus type A and Clostridium difficile from hands. Measures to improve hand hygiene in health facilities could include training staff to wash hands, increasing access to alcohol-based detergents and written and verbal reminders to staff.
More research is needed to determine which of these measures is more effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is being cited as an inexpensive and essential tool for achieving good health and even nutrition.
However, the lack of safe water, soap or handwashing equipment in homes, schools and workplaces challenges the availability of handwashing practices globally.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, handwashing water lions near personal or public toilets are rare, although cheaper alternatives to handwashing stations exist.
However, low levels of hand washing, not usually due to a lack of soap or water, can be the result of bad habits.
Promoting handwashing with soap can influence electoral policy, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term behavioural change at the societal level.
Monitoring and evaluation are necessary to ensure that this mandatory action is effectively implemented.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in increasing handwashing rates in low- and middle-income countries, while social ad campaigns were less effective. One example of promoting handwashing in schools is the "Three-Star Initiative" by UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap while complying with other sanitary requirements.
By adhering to minimum standards, schools can eventually move from one star to three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of handwashing promotion measures to reduce childhood morbidity and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that aims to create a change in people's behaviour. In response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the use of handwashing emojis.
A small number of studies, overall, dismiss the more cost-effective handwashing in developing countries in relation to the number of years lost to disability.
However, a review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is considerably more cost-effective than other measures, from an economic point of view.
The importance of handwashing for human health - especially for people in vulnerable situations, such as new mothers or wounded soldiers in hospital - was first identified in the mid-19th century by two of the pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, who "founded modern nursing".
At the time, most people believed that infections were caused by an unpleasant odor called miasma.
In the 1980s, the outbreak of foodborne illness and healthcare-related infections led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States to promote hand hygiene more broadly as an important method of preventing the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have led to increased awareness in many countries about the importance of handwashing with soap to protect against infectious diseases.
For example, posters entitled "The Right Hand Washing Tips" were placed next to hand washing sinks in public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "not having any part in anything" means a declaration of a person's unwillingness to accept responsibility for or share in an issue.
The term is taken from the Bible in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate reversed the decision to crucify Christ, but the phrase is now used in some English-speaking societies with a much wider meaning.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth, in an attempt to clear a fictional stain, forcibly washes her hands, indicating her guilty conscience for the crimes she had committed and encouraged her husband to commit.
It has also been found that after being reminded or thinking about immoral actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to use handwashing equipment more frequently.
In addition, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such a thorough cleaning are less likely to participate in other "cleaning" compensatory measures, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for hygienic purposes and symbolism. Hand washing symbolically and the use of water and not soap to wash hands is part of the hand washing rituals that are displayed in many religions including Baha'i, Hinduism, Twelve and Nitiyat Yama'im in Judaism, Bath and Bath in Christianity and Bath and Bath in Islam. Religions also recommend hand washing after certain activities.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam mandate hand washing after using the toilet.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam recommend washing hands before and after every meal.
Control of COVID-19-related risks in the workplace.
Control of COVID-19-related risks in the workplace means the use of safe hygiene practices to control risks in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate control of workplace hazards depends on the workplace and the type of job and should be based on an assessment of the sources of risk, the severity of the disease in the community and risk factors for workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) announcement, occupations that are at lower risk, have less occupational contact with the general public and other coworkers, and are recommended to take basic measures to prevent infection, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, observing respiratory and daily hygiene practices, and preventing workplace contamination.
Moderately high-risk occupations include occupations where employees require frequent or close contact with people who are not or suspected to be infected with COVID-19, but may become infected due to the continuous spread of the virus in the community or due to international travel.
This includes those who come into contact with the general public, for example in schools, in densely populated workplaces and in some high-volume retail shops.
Risk control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, may include ventilation through high-efficiency air filters, sweat protectors and having personal protective equipment in case of contact with an infected person with COVID-19.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommends that health care workers who are exposed to people with or suspected of having COVID-19, including those who are known to be at high risk, be at high risk if employees perform activities that result in the production of airborne particulates or collect, move or handle samples from people with or suspected of having COVID-19, or if employees perform activities that result in the production of airborne particulates.
A suitable approach to risk control for these individuals includes engineering controls such as the creation of negative pressure ventilation chambers and the use of personal protective equipment commensurate with the job function.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have a variety of effects on the work environment.
Employees may not be present at work because of illness, the need to care for others or fear of possible confrontation.
Business models may change, both in terms of what goods are needed and in terms of how these goods are available (e.g. shopping during off-peak hours or shopping through home delivery services or shopping by car).
Finally, the transport of goods from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 could be stopped. Preparedness and programmes to respond to infectious diseases could be used to guide preventive measures.
These programmes examine and address the risk levels associated with different workplaces and work tasks, including sources of exposure to disease, risk factors from the home and community, and individual risk factors for employees, such as ageing or chronic illness.
It also describes the control measures needed to eliminate those risks, as well as possible plans to deal with situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparations and programmes to respond to infectious diseases may be subject to national or local recommendations.
The objectives of the response to the outbreak include reducing transmission among employees, protecting those most at risk of health side effects, safeguarding business operations and minimising negative impacts on other entities in their supply chain.
The severity of disease in areas where commercial activities take place affects the behaviour of decisions taken.
The hazard control hierarchy includes a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to classify hazard controls in proportion to their effectiveness.
In cases where it is not possible to eliminate the risks of COVID-19, the most effective control methods are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Engineering control methods involve keeping workers away from occupational hazards without relying on employee behaviour and can be the most cost-effective solution if feasible.
Administrative control procedures include changes to policies or procedures that are implemented by an employee or employer.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is less efficient than engineering and administrative control methods, but can prevent exposure to the virus to some extent.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the risks to workers, installed correctly (e.g. respirators), worn consistently and correctly, inspected regularly, maintained and replaced if necessary, properly removed, cleaned and properly maintained or disposed of to prevent contamination.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), occupations with lower risk have less work-related contact with the general public and other coworkers.
Basic measures recommended to prevent infection in all work environments include: hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if sick, observing respiratory practices including covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, preparing paper towels and trash cans, preparing for remote work or shift work if necessary, encouraging employees not to use other people's tools and equipment, and cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected persons is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay home as long as they are free of fever-reducing or other symptom-modifying medications, from fever, fever symptoms, and other illness symptoms, for at least 24 hours, and that leave policies should be flexible, allowing employees to stay home to care for sick family members, and that employees should be aware of these policies.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), occupations with a moderate level of risk include occupations where employees require frequent contact or close contact at a distance of less than six feet (1.8 meters) with people who are not infected with COVID-19 or suspected of being infected, but may become infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the continuous community-wide spread of the virus or due to international travel in areas where COVID-19 has been widely spread.
Administrative controls for these and high-risk groups include: encouraging employees to stay home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, creating alternating shifts, avoiding unnecessary travel to places where there is a risk of COVID-19, developing emergency plans including creating contact-response training for employees, training employees to observe COVID-19 hazardous agents at work, including the installation of protective clothing and other protective equipment, including protective clothing and protective gear, providing access to a minimum level of protective equipment, protecting the public if they are exposed to COVID-19, providing access to sanitary and other protective equipment, or ensuring a minimum level of protection to the environment if they are exposed to COVID-19.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use a respirator.
If a person on board becomes ill, appropriate measures to protect staff and other passengers may include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, allocating only one staff member to serve the sick person and providing a face mask to the sick person, or requiring the patient to cover his or her mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
Aircrew should use disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or when in contact with body fluids or contaminated surfaces, and should use additional personal protective equipment if a sick person has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biohazard bag and contaminated surfaces should be disinfected. For commercial transportation, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk control includes postponing travel at the time of illness, individual quarantine, and in the event of fever or other symptoms during travel, prompt notification to the on-board medical center.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be done in the quarantined person's cabin. For schools and child care centers, if an infected person has been in the school building regardless of the outbreak in the community, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that the premises be closed for a short period of time for cleaning or disinfection purposes.
If there is low or moderate community transmission, the following measures may be implemented to prevent social distancing: cancellation of scientific tours, gatherings and other large gatherings such as physical education classes or free or meal-only cafeterias, increased table distances, increased time between arrivals and departures, restrictions on nonessential visitors, and separate use of sanitary facilities for children with influenza symptoms.
When there is a significant risk of community transmission, in addition to social distancing practices, long-term school closures should be considered. For law enforcement personnel performing their daily activities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers their immediate health risk low.
Law enforcement officers who need to be in contact with persons with or suspected of having COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact at the time of arrest, staff should disinfect their belts and accessories before reuse with household cleaning spray or clean and disinfecting towels, while following standard procedures for the use and disposal of used personal protective equipment (PPE) and the washing of clothing.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States considers health care workers to be at high risk.
Occupations with high levels of risk include healthcare, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to people with or suspected of having COVID-19.
Workers whose work leads to the production of airborne particulate matter or who collect, move or handle samples of people with or suspected of having COVID-19 are at very high risk.
Activities that lead to the production of airborne particles include tubing, coughing, bronchoscopy, and some operations and dental examinations or invasive sampling of the patient.
Occupations with a very high risk include workers who are engaged in the preparation of the bodies of people who have died with or suspected of having COVID-19. In the case of a ruptured cadaver, the risk level is very high. Additional engineering control methods for this group include the creation of separate rooms for patients with or suspected of having COVID-19, including when performing activities that result in the production of airborne particles.
Negative pressure air may be appropriate for some healthcare facilities.
Patient specimens should be handled with biosafety level 3 precautions in mind.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that if newly infected patients are suspected of having COVID-19, they be kept in a designated and isolated waiting room. In addition to the use of other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommends the use of a respirator for anyone working within 6 feet of patients with or suspected of having COVID-19, as well as for those who perform activities that result in the production of airborne particulates.
In the United States, use an N95 respiratory filter device that is NIOSH approved and in accordance with the requirements of a comprehensive and documented respiratory safety program that includes appropriate testing, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and make it more comfortable for workers to use. The World Health Organization does not recommend full-body masks because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through bodily fluids.
The World Health Organization only recommends the use of surgical masks for screening at entry points.
The World Health Organization recommends the use of surgical masks, glasses or face protectors, guns and gloves for people who collect respiratory system samples from patients or care for or carry COVID-19 patients and do nothing that would result in the production of airborne particles.
In the event of a surgical procedure where suspended particles are produced in the air, the surgical mask should be replaced with an N95 respirator or FFP2.
Given that the global supply of personal protective equipment is not sufficient, the World Health Organization recommends the following measures to minimise the need for personal protective equipment: conducting medical examinations in private, creating physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only persons directly involved in the care of a COVID-19 patient to enter the room, using personal protective equipment only for specific tasks, using a respiratory mask when caring for multiple patients if all of them have the same disease, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment, and not using masks for people who do not have symptoms.

This month we see ourselves in remarkable circumstances.
The COVID-19 pandemic is something that clearly highlights the global connectivity of human beings and our responsibilities towards each other.
The challenges are unprecedented for us, but we know that our best response depends on the compassion, cooperation and community building that is at the heart of this organisation.
The consistency and level of care we have observed among our colleagues through email, contact and chat, reflects incredible people with whom we have the privilege and the chance to work.
I am very grateful and proud to have all of you as my colleagues, by my side.
Last week, someone appreciated what we do.
They reminded me how significant it is that the world can now refer to Wikipedia and what a powerful sign it is that this important resource can be made available online and accessible to everyone.
Your work makes it possible, whether you keep the sites up to date or our colleagues get paid or our communities are safe.
The world, now more than ever, needs the information that Wikipedia provides.
This is the moment when not only what we do but how we do it will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will be making significant adjustments to the way we carry out our joint tasks from the beginning of next week.
Modifications related to our work and programs
As Robin noted earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and plan for the days and months ahead.
In that conversation, we made a decision that we thought was the right answer to what we were facing and the best way to keep the organization going in the long run.
We wanted to support the stress of slavery and our long-term mission.
If you need a cut, that's fine.
To all employees, contractors and contract workers:
Secondly, we do not expect to work 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week.
We do not announce a strike - if you can work more normal hours, you will be doing the job.
However, the world is currently unpredictable and it doesn't matter whether you are caring for a loved one, shopping for food, or seeing a doctor, your health is our priority.
We're not tracking you.
If you are sick, do not work.
This should go without saying, but we're not saying it.
There is no need to take a leave of absence or personal leave - just tell your manager and help your team to review calendars and schedules to make sure that someone has covered key tasks.
(If your COVID-19 test result is positive, please inform Bryan from T&C so T&C can assist you and ensure your condition is being managed properly.)
The wages of employees who work part-time are paid in full.
As we have said before, we are committed to our commitments to contractors and part-time workers.
The wage is paid to everyone on the basis of normal working hours under normal conditions.
This includes you even if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to release their stress from the world around them.
What we do, especially in situations like this, can be very valuable.
Again, I say, this is about your self-awareness.
We do not ask you to contact your manager so that we know what to expect and can plan accordingly.
Some tasks are considered necessary.
There are things that we have to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Safety and Capital Raising (and some others) teams are doing essential and important work that may need further support.
We will start a process with other departments to assess the current objectives and focus on supporting the resources needed for our mission.
There is a lot of work for all of us, we will all focus on the most fundamental projects.
If we slow down now, we won't get hurt later.
We don't have a plan to work twice as hard to get things done as soon as the pandemic is over.
You are not expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now impossible.
We recognise that circumstances have changed and we will seek to set new targets and timetables if necessary.
How does APP (Annual Programming) work?
To adapt to the new realities and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to revise our 2021-2020 Annual Programme Delivery Schedule.
Our goal is to propose an extension of the 2020-2019 program that will allow us more time to budget and allow employees to prioritize vital tasks, taking care of themselves and caring for their loved ones, including those who need or want to work fewer hours over the next few weeks.
This extension of time considerably reduces the burden of current work programmes across the organisation.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and, once it has been approved, will inform the representatives and teams on the next steps.
Thank you to the annual planning team for leading this effort.
Office situation, exposure to disease and cleaning
Last week we received information that one of our colleagues based in SF may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precaution, we have employed a team of antiviral cleaners to disinfect all surfaces in our San Francisco office.
They used a hospital grade I antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the lobby edge and elevator that runs to the first floor.
The building uses its own surveillance protocol and uses products that are beneficial to the health of its occupants.
We are confident that when we decide to return, the office will be well prepared.
Our Washington office is located at WeWork, and they have shared their COVID-19 protocols with us and all of our DC-based employees.
As per San Francisco's state guidelines, as of last week our Washington, D.C. office has been converted into a fully remote complex.
As some of our New York-based colleagues know, we have also discussed renting a house in Brooklyn.
This discussion will continue, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Old colleagues who work with us remotely know that this can be a customization and would like to give you some suggestions:
Limit the duration of the sessions to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer meetings are needed, consider how to hold them in a few days.
Make the meeting clear, have an agenda and send in advance the required information for the study.
Set up your video as a default with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to make it easier to collaborate and communicate live.
Appoint someone to lead the meeting, someone to monitor the chat to keep track of questions and speakers' lists, and someone to take notes (or joint notes).
If you need a comfortable helmet, email the technical support team.
Use your own health insurance for your mid-term appointment.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk about shared tasks with your colleagues.
The HR operational team is seeking ergonomics-based and seminar-based guidance to support the increase of work spread across the foundation.
Last week we asked all recipients of grassroots-level financial incentives such as the editathon to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia until the World Health Organization declares the end of the pandemic.
We will inform them if we are aware that our request for cancellation of programmes and other restrictions may make it impossible to carry out agreed activities related to the receipt of financial privileges and that no one will be penalized for delay or amendment of their objectives.
In the coming weeks we will be presenting more guides on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community forums.
It seems that there is a general feeling throughout the global community, both discomfort because of these disorders and at the same time a sense of relief because of their transparency and ability to focus on the activities of their own communities, Wikimedia, etc.
As I move forward, CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the influences and maintain our communication with them.
Staying in touch on issues related to COVID-19
We will send you a meeting invitation for special employees for next Thursday, 14:00 UTC to 07:00 PT, on your calendar.
We will use this time to provide you with more and more information, answer your questions and spend some time simply communicating with each other.
We are all in this together and we are here to help you in any way we can.
In addition, you can find relevant information via email and other information related to COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
The CRT keeps these pages updated and keeps all the information in one place.
We are also seeking to maintain regular contact with those of our employees who are residents of countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, the mainstream or the challenges of news coverage, or anything else you may need help with, please do not hesitate to let us know and cooperate with CRT.
We are here to help and support you if you need it.
If you would like to discuss a confidential or sensitive topic, please email Bryan Judan - International Operations Manager Human Resources.
None of these changes should be seen as a waiver of our work and commitments.
It is also indicative that at this moment our actions and commitments may need to be adapted to an approach that we have not had in the past.
These are the stages that we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue our work and support our movement and deliver the services that the world depends on.
When the time comes to do what we planned, it will be waiting for us.
Now is the time to support each other and create space for the important things that are going to happen in the weeks and possibly months ahead.
We need all of you to make this happen, so we ask you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can be at your best when the need increases.
Now, please wash your hands and do not touch the image itself!
The following are the most commonly used methods of identifying the most important issues in the development of the project: (a) the most important issues in the project, (b) the most important issues in the project, (c) the most important issues in the project, (d) the most important issues in the project, (e) the most important issues in the project, (f) the most important issues in the project, (g) the most important issues in the project, (g) the most important issues in the project, (g) the most important issues in the project, (g) the most important issues in the project, (g) the most important issues in the project, (g) the most important issues in the project, (g) the most important issues in the project, (g) the most important issues in the project, (g) the most important issues in the project, (g) the most important issues in the project, (g) the most important issues in the project, (g) the most important issues in the project, (g) the most important issues in the project, (g) the most important issues in the project, (g) the most important issues in the project, (g) the most important issues in the project, (g) the most important issues in the project, (g) the most important issues in the project, (g) the most important issues, (g) the most important issues, (g) the most important issues, etc).
b'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that attaches to the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, lungs, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 disrupts the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-related enzyme ACE by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (((1-7), which makes it a promising pharmaceutical target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as a cell entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of this enzyme is often denoted hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 is a type of metabolic enzyme that is found on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein is a protein containing an N-terminal peptidease M2 domain and a C-terminal renal amino acid carrier domain called colectin.
ACE2 is a type I single-transmitter membrane protein that is localized to the active domain of the enzyme in the vicinity of the surface of lung cells and other lymphocytes.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is separated from the membrane domain by another enzyme called shdaz, and the resulting protein solution is excreted in the bloodstream and finally excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membranes of type II haemorrhagic cells, mainly lung, small intestinal enterocytes, endothelial, splenic and smooth muscle cells and smooth muscle cells of most organs.
ACE2 mRNA signaling is seen in the cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 activation is as an ACE inhibitor.
ACE converts the hormone angiotensin I into angiotensin-constricting vessel II.
ACE2 in turn separates the phenylelanine amino acid carboxylic-terminal amino acid carboxyl-terminal from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and is hydrolysed by angiotensin by the Rha (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH) of the vascular system.
ACE2 can break down a number of other peptides such as [des-Arg9]-bradycins, oplin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane flow of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in the development of heart failure.
ACE2, also known as the membrane protein, re-enacts the role of the primary entry point into the cell for certain coronaviruses such as HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).
More importantly, the attachment of the protein spike S1 of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 viruses to the enzymatic domain ACE2 at the cell surface leads to the intromodulation and migration of the virus and the enzyme to the endosomes within the cell.
This entry process requires the preparation of protein S preparation by the TMPRSS2 serine-host protease TMPRSS2 serine-host proteinase whose inhibition is currently being investigated as a potential treatment. It has been hypothesized that decreasing ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have suggested that treatment with the ACE standard inhibitor and ARB should continue.
A systematic review and multi-analysis published on 11 July 2012 determined that the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls.
In addition, the risk of pneumonia was reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at a higher risk of developing pneumonia, particularly those who had suffered a stroke and cardiac arrest.
The use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a reduction in lung injury, although the outcome was weaker than the overall outcome in terms of the likelihood of developing lung disease.
It is thought that human reverse ACE (rhACE2) is a novel treatment for acute renal injury and appears to have improved respiratory hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours with a 30-minute onset of action plus a 24-hour duration of action.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people with sensitivity to systemic and classical renin-angiotensin-converting inhibitors (RSA-receptors) or angiotensin-II circulation-promoting pathogens. The efficacy of rhACE2 injection has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
b'COVID-19 applications are mobile phone software applications used for contact tracking during the 20-2019 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying persons (contacts) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Several programmes have been developed or proposed, supported by public authorities in some territories and regions.
Multiple frameworks have been developed for the preparation of contact tracing programmes.
Privacy concerns have been raised, particularly in systems based on the geolocation of application users.
Less intrusive solutions include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would be including support for Bluetooth-oriented apps directly on Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has developed an app that allows citizens to understand whether they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It's already being used in over 200 cities in China. In Singapore, they're using an app called TraceTogether.
The program was developed by the local IT community, distributed as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has deployed a Bluetooth-based program called "StopKorona!" to track potential contact with infected individuals and provide immediate response to medical referrals.
The programme is developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government announced that contact planning was at an advanced stage of development and would be ready for deployment within a few weeks. A similar program ("StopCovid") is being implemented in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and Zealand are considering programs based on the TraceTogether program and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce a geographic demarcation program for COVID-19 patients and residents of Moscow, to prevent these people from leaving their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, has pointed to a number of practical problems with program-driven systems, including false positive results and potential inefficiencies in program use in small population samples.
Apple, in response to concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious "coronavirus" applications, has imposed restrictions on the types of organizations authorized to add "coronavirus" applications to the App Store, allowing only official or reputable organizations to do so.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, and in particular stated that it is unclear whether the surveillance infrastructure created for the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled after the threat is eliminated.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have issued a statement calling for the restriction of this type of surveillance.
The following organizations have listed eight conditions for public projects:
supervision must be legal, necessary and proportionate;
The content of the monitoring and monitoring files must be provided with clauses with the possibility of automatic cancellation;
The use of data should be limited to cases related to COVID-19;
the security of data and the identification of data must be guaranteed and protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should not be used as a context for increased discrimination and exclusion;
the transfer of data to third parties must be within the framework of the law;
Guarantees should be considered to prevent abuse and the right of citizens to complain about abuse;
The objective participation of all relevant stakeholders, including public health experts and marginalized groups, is essential. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) Germany and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also published lists.
The proposed Google/Apple programme aims to address the problem of continuous monitoring by removing tracking devices from the operating systems of their devices, once the need arises.
In some countries, the network-based location-based process has been used instead of the program, thus eliminating the need for software downloads and the ability to escape from the clutter.
In Israel, network-oriented modeling has been adopted.
Network-based solutions that access raw data locally may infringe privacy.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data; a number of privacy systems use central servers only for internal communications (see section below).
In South Korea, an unprogrammed system was used to track contacts.
The system, instead of using specialized software, collected tracking information from various sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data and used it to send message notifications to people who may have been infected.
In addition to using this information to message potential contacts, the government is making location information publicly available. This type of disclosure has been authorized due to the wide-ranging changes in data protection laws following the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is made publicly available through a number of applications and websites. Some countries, such as Germany, have adopted centralised systems and privacy safeguards.
As of 6 April 2020, these details have not yet been disclosed.
Privacy contact tracking is an accepted concept with a documented research background dating back to at least 2013.By 7 April 2020, dozens of expert groups were working on privacy-preserving strategies, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT is a coordinated search that includes both centralised and decentralised approaches and is not a standalone protocol. Decentralised protocols include the privacy-protected decentralised proximity protocol (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the contact-temporary number (TCN, also known as contact event number, CEN), the privacy-sensitive protocols and the contact tracking instrument (PACT).
In these protocols, personally identifiable data is never removed from the device and all matches occur within the device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab has been developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-preserving practices in the process of collecting and using location and routing data, to track the COVID-19 outbreak.
The platform is based on research results contained in the official report "Programs in Action: Protecting Privacy During a Pandemic" published in March 2020. Another similar initiative, the SafeTrace platform, is the product of Enigma MPC. The company is focused on the development of privacy technologies that have been developed at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive geographic and health data with other users and managers without compromising data privacy.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was formed by a number of groups, which were based on essentially similar and overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing dispersion and providing a framework for global cooperation on prevention and warning programmes, key aspects of achieving widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol, which had been used in the official government programme, publicly available.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the controllers of the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative that they claimed was designed to protect privacy. The initiative is based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy encryption.
They have also published the specifications of the main technologies used in this system.
According to Apple and Google, the system will be launched in three stages:
Introducing tools to empower governments to create privacy-enabled coronavirus surveillance programs
Direct integration of this capability into iOS and Android. Google and Apple intend to address the issues of continuous adoption and monitoring by distributing the system through an OS update and then removing it in a similar fashion once the threat is resolved.
b'Drug substitution (also known as drug use change, drug profile change, drug function change, or drug therapy substitution) refers to the modification of the use of an approved drug to treat a disease or physical problem different from what the drug was originally developed for.
This is a pathway of scientific research that is being implemented to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research objectives include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfer of recovered plasma. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 pharmacological proteins, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
These interconnected analyses provide a rational approach to the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins include the quasi-papayine protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ribofosfatase ADP.
Hussein A and colleagues looked to examine several proposed drugs that at the time had been optimized and analyzed for skeletal similarity to the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in a preclinical study that would be proposed in the design of the clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine-related compounds were among four drugs being studied in a clinical trial.
Andrew Cuomo, Governor of New York, announced that New York State trials on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA declared the use of chloroquine hydroxy sulfate and chloroquine phosphate as "emergency use authorized" (EUA).
This treatment has not been approved by the FDA in clinical trials and use as an EUA has been authorised only for experimental treatment and emergency use in inpatients who are unable to receive the drug in clinical trials.
The CDC stated that the need for, dosage for, or duration of use of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been determined.
Doctors have stated that they will take these drugs if there is no alternative.
A research group in Istanbul, Turkey, is running a small research project on the use of chloroquine in combination with whey, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Extensive studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a study on the safety and efficacy of pre-administration of hydroxychloroquine.
Clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China claimed that favipiravir was "fully effective".
The test result in 35 patients was negative at a median of 4 days, while the duration of disease in 45 patients who had not been diagnosed was 11 days.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients received favipiravir and the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the evidence available on the efficacy of this medicine was insufficient and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its own storage and receive assistance from the military to deliver the drug to teaching hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has offered to buy the drug to the Trump administration, which may not be effective in treating acute cases of disease where the virus has multiplied.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or people who intend to become pregnant.
A review of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination antiviral of lopinavir and ritonavir, determined that no benefit was observed.
These drugs were designed to prevent HIV replication by adhesion to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a combination that can bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. Criticism has been raised in the scientific community about the redirection of resources towards changing the use of drugs that were specifically designed to treat HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organisation included lopinavir/ritonavir in an international study.
Gilead Sciences had developed Remdesivir as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences later determined that Remdesivir was active in the laboratory against the viruses Fello, Pneumo, Paramexo and Corona.
One of the problems with antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through mutation, which may lead to more severe disease and spread.
Some pre-clinical studies suggest that Remdesivir may be an effective genetic inhibitor against resistance. Several clinical trials, including two conducted by the Cleveland Teaching Hospital, are underway, one involving people with mild disease and one involving people with severe disease.
Three clinical trials on the effect of intravenous vitamin C injection on hospitalized persons with severe COVID-19 disease were conducted. Two were drug-controlled (China and Canada) and one was uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State began trials of the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) of Japan (NCGM) is planning to conduct a clinical trial of Alvesco tigin (cyclosonide), an asthma inhalation corticosteroid, for the treatment of asymptomatic patients infected with the novel coronavirus.
A phase II trial of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 enzyme type 2 is underway, involving 200 patients. 200 inpatient and outpatient patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria will be enrolled in this trial to determine the effectiveness of this treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Canadian Heart Institute are investigating the role of chloroquine in reducing inflammation and respiratory effects in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
In the study, titled "Collecorona", 6,000 patients aged at least 40 years who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have mild symptoms and no need for hospitalization will be enrolled.
Pregnant or breast-feeding women or women using effective contraceptive methods are not eligible to participate in this study.
Several blood-holding medicines are being studied in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients and therefore the Italian Medical Agency is obliged to disseminate its instructions.
A multi-centre news study involving 300 patients to investigate the effect of enoxaparin sodium on prevention and treatment was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a type of virus, significant scientific attention has focused on changing the efficacy of antiviral drugs that were developed to treat previous infectious diseases such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin according to guidelines of VIRAST 7 China for the treatment of COVID-19 has been proposed
Omi Fenovir: Omi Fenovir according to the guidelines of Virast 7 China was proposed for the treatment of COVID-19
Among the antibiotics that have been proposed as possible alternatives to COVID-19 treatments, the following are listed:
Tokilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): confirmed in China.
There are also trials in Italy and China. See also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several attempts to develop a vaccine are underway.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it did not expect the SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the virus, vaccine to be available before the next 18 months.
Five proposed vaccines were in Phase I immunity studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A widespread global outbreak occurred in 2020, leading to significant investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using dispersed genomes to produce a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, it was announced that the CEPI initiative's requirements for vaccine development were speed, production capacity, stability of scale and universal access.
In April, CEP scientists announced that 10 different technology platforms were under investigation and development in early 2020 to produce an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of the platform, which are included in the Phase I safety studies, include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (expansion factor phase I and proposed vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral carrier (phase I expander and proposed vaccine: CanSino Biologics, which is a carrier of adenovirus type 5)
According to the CEPI scientists' announcement in April, a total of 115 proposed vaccines are in the early stages of development, with 78 of them confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute announcement) and 37 others publicly announced, but few of them are publicly available (assuming they are in the planning or design phase).
Phase I-II studies are a preliminary safety and efficacy safety review, usually randomised and controlled with DaronMast, conducted at different centres, to determine more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, a control group, and adverse events at the optimum dose as part of the evaluation of the efficacy of a vaccine for disease prevention.
Of the 79 proposed vaccines in the active development phase (approved by early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested on humans (still in the "professional clinical" research phase).
On or about 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was conducting research into the ability of a molecular vaccine to modify the genetic makeup of viral proteins and simulate the immune response.
On or about 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of vaccine research and that human trials are scheduled to begin in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were presented at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On or about 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, under the management of Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that it had begun the process of developing a vaccine.
Janssen, in collaboration with its biotechnology partner, Vaxart, is developing a food-based vaccine.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing collaboration with Vaxart for the development of a vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen Laboratory in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine with similar technology to the vaccine used to treat cancer neoplasm antigens.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the development of the vaccine and were in the early stages of testing.
On 27 February 2020, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, a subsidiary of Generex, announced that it had begun a project to produce a li-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They intended to develop a vaccine that could be tested on humans for 90 days.
On 5 March 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Facility Research Center at Fort Detrick, and the Walter Reed Army Research Center at Silver Spring, both in Western Maryland, announced that they were developing a vaccine.
On or about March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions, in partnership with Novavax, entered into a
The vaccine development and production area has been informed.
The participants later announced that they planned to complete the preclinical trial and Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that 11 individuals are undergoing testing in quarantine and that vaccine development in the shortest case would take at least one and a half to two years.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company based in Quebec City, Quebec, announced the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The proposed vaccine is in the laboratory research phase, with human trials expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had proposed to CureVac that it provide exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine by paying an 'emergency amount' - which the German government opposed.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
A proposed mRNA-based vaccine, called BNT162, is currently in preclinical testing and high-clinical trials are scheduled to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, one of the Italian biotechnology companies, announced that the results of their preclinical trials will be ready in April 2020 and that their proposed final vaccine may be tested on humans in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Innovation (CEPI) announced a $4.9 million investment in a consortium of COVID-19 vaccine research involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienne, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh. With this investment, the total investment in COVID-19 vaccine development reached $29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners in the development of COVID-19 vaccines include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six proposed vaccines.
Researchers at Royal College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-reinforcing RNA vaccine to combat COVID-19.
The proposed vaccine was developed within 14 days of receipt of follow-up information from China.
In late March, the Government of Canada announced that it was considering C$275 million to fund 96 research projects in the area of COVID-19 response, including several proposed vaccines at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan projects.
At about the same time, the Government of Canada announced that C$192 million had been earmarked specifically for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, and plans were underway to create a National Vaccine Bank of several new vaccines, with the potential to be used in the event of further coronavirus outbreaks.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported a trial of PittCoVacc, a proposed COVID-19 vaccine, on mice, and announced that the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines with MNA strong antigen-specific antibody reactions [in mice] were detected within 2 weeks after immunization.
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo Faculty of Pharmacy announced the design of a proposed DNA-based vaccine, possibly for renal exposure.
Using bacteriophages, this DNA will be engineered to replicate within human bacteria and produce harmless virus-like particles. This process stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three US universities merged their resources to access IBM's cloud computing and cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have inhomogeneous or non-specific effects.
This means they may have benefits beyond disease prevention.
Another randomized study in Australia is set to enroll 4,170 active healthcare providers.
Vaccines in the production phase may not be safe or effective.
Preliminary research to assess the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models specific to COVID-19, such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicates the need for prevention of biosecurity level 3 contamination for live viruses and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no vaccine to treat or prevent SARS that has been proven safe and effective in humans.
Based on research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide. There is no effective vaccine against MERS.
During the MERS outbreak, the idea was that ongoing research on MERS would possibly provide a useful template for the development of a vaccine and a drug against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that had passed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines that were all virus carriers. There were also two adenovirus carriers (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-carrier (MVA-MERS-S) vaccine.
Views spread on social media have led to the promotion of conspiracy theories about the known existence of the COVID-19 virus and the existence of a vaccine for it.
The innovations mentioned on various social media refer to previous innovations related to genetic sequencing and vaccines related to other types of coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a type of infectious disease that is known as acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) agent-inhibitor.
The common symptoms are fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, gout, dizziness, hearing loss, and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure to the pathogen and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some cases are caused by viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases of infection worldwide from 210 countries and territories had been reported, with 153,000 of those leading to death.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is transmitted mainly by close contact, often through tiny droplets from coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although the pressure causes the dispersion of these droplets, usually the droplets fall over long distances on the ground or on surfaces rather than being transported.
Individuals may become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the eyes, nose and mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
The probability of infection is higher in the first three days after the onset of symptoms. However, there is also the possibility of virus transmission before the onset of symptoms and in the later stages of the disease. The standard diagnostic method is the moment-reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from the nasopharynx swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of having the virus and those around them.
The recommendations for the use of masks for the general public vary; some officials are against the use of masks and some are in favor of it, and some consider wearing masks mandatory.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of disease has been recorded in most countries in each of the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms may include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest area, dizziness, difficulty walking, and bruising of the face or lips. If these symptoms do not resolve, you should see your doctor immediately.
Upper respiratory tract symptoms, such as whooping cough, nasal discharge or cold sores, have also been seen with less frequency.
Gastro-epileptic symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in variable percentages.
Some cases in China had only experienced early respiratory distress and severe heart palpitations.
In others, the disease may progress to the stage of pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and even death.
I am disappointed with this period of uncertainty.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five to six days but may vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of individuals, symptoms become apparent within 11.5 days from the time of infection. Reports suggest that not all infected individuals are necessarily symptomatic.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in the transmission process is not yet well understood. However, preliminary evidence suggests that these individuals may be a factor in the spread of the disease.
The proportion of asymptomatic individuals is currently unknown and is under investigation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has stated that 20% of all confirmed cases of asymptomatic hospitalization remain asymptomatic.
The National Health Commission of China began including asymptomatic cases in its statistics on 1 April. Of 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both mixture and saliva may be virus-carrying.
Talking out loud spreads more particles than talking slowly.
Singapore researchers have shown that not covering the mouth and nose during coughing may cause the spread of droplets up to 4.5 metres (15 ft) away.
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has stated that there is a possibility of airborne transmission and positive samples of viral RNA have been observed in air collectors installed in corridors outside people's rooms.
Certain medical procedures such as tubing and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory filtration and airborne spread of the virus.
Although there are concerns about transmission of the virus through fecal matter, this is assumed to be a low probability. The probability of transmission of the virus through people with symptoms is higher. The probability of transmission of the virus before the onset of symptoms is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has stated that although the mechanisms of transmission are unknown, each person usually infects two to three people. The duration of the virus on surfaces is from a few hours to a few days.
In particular, the virus survived on a single day, on a plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) cover for three days, and on a 99% copper cover for up to four hours.
Of course, this time depends on humidity and temperature.
The correct use of soap and detergent is also effective. Soap products remove the protective layer of viral fat, inactivate it, and increase it on the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and gluconate of cleroxide (a surgical insecticide), have less effect. In the Hong Kong study, clever samples were taken on average two days after bed-break.
In five of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load and in the sixth patient, the highest viral load was seen on day two of the trial.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a modern strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first detected in three people with pneumonia and associated with a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All of the characteristics of the modern SARS-CoV-2 virus are seen in related coronaviruses.
The virus is transmitted outside the human body by household soap. The protective bubble soap is transmitted from the body. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
COVID-19 is most likely to affect the lungs because the virus enters the host cell via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant in lung type II haemoglobin cells.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called spike (puplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac arrest was observed in 12% of infected patients admitted to Wuhan hospital. This problem is more common in severe cases of illness.
The occurrence of cardiovascular symptoms due to systemic inflammatory reactions and immune system disorders in the progression of disease, including progression of disease, and acute myocardial infarction may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are located in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
High rates of thrombotic (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) occurrence have been observed in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be related to poor diagnostic performance. Autopsies of people who died from COVID-19 have indicated diffuse adenocarcinoma (DAD) and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory penetration of the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 tends to target ACE2-containing ACE2 enveloped cells in the respiratory tract, severe systemic inflammatory symptoms have been observed in COVID-19 patients.
In particular, the association of pathogenic GM-CSF secreting T cells with the uptake of IL-6 secreting monocytes has been shown to be associated with inflammatory and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocyte infiltration has also been reported during an insufficient liver.
WHO has published several test protocols for this disease.
The standard diagnostic method is instantaneous reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on breath samples obtained with a nasopharynx swab. Of course, a nasal swab or mixed sample is also applicable.
The results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
A blood test may also be used, but this requires taking two blood samples two weeks apart. In this type of test, the result is not directly relevant.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a single strain of the coronavirus and distribute its genetic sequencing, allowing laboratories around the world to run polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect viral infection.
As of 4 April 2020, pathogen testing (which has the ability to detect active infections and a person's infectious history) was in the hands of studies but not yet widely used.
The accuracy of this Chinese experiment in the field of testing is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month. The Diagnostic Manual of Zhong Nan Hospital of Wuhan University has proposed methods for diagnosing infections based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
The glass matte codort is a multi-lobula secondary method with lateral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution for the diagnosis of early infections.
Subcutaneous overload, defective coating (thickening of the bladder with the maturation of the bubonic variable) and stiffness may be signs of progression of the disease.
There is little information available on the microscopic and pathophysiological effects of COVID-19.
The most important pathological findings in autopsy include:
Macroscopy: lateral aspect, precard, cardiac stiffness and respiratory fat
Four levels of viral pneumonia severity are observed:
Mild pulmonary: respiratory disease, hyperplasia of the pneumocytes, abnormal adult pneumocytes, inflammation of the intestine by penetration of the lymphocyte and formation of a few-sectioned adult cells
Severe acute pneumonia: diffuse adenocardial infarction (DAD) with diffuse adenocardial secretions.
DAD is a contributing factor to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Lung tissue in recovery: formation of filters in the airways and respiratory fissure fibrosis
Blood: diffuse intravenous coagulation (DIC); reaction of the blood; locorithroplastic reaction
Precautions to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with washed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a paper towel during coughing and sneezing and using the inner ear, if a towel is not available.
Hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is especially recommended.
The CDC has suggested the use of cloth masks in public places to a limited extent to prevent the spread of disease by asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing practices are being pursued to reduce contact of infected individuals with large groups of people by closing schools and workplaces, limiting travel and cancelling large gatherings.
The distancing guidelines also include the observance of a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between persons.
There is no effective medicine to prevent infection with COVID-19. As vaccine discovery is not envisaged until at least 2021, an important part of the COVID-19 management process is to try to reduce the pandemic peak, or "flatten the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands regularly for at least 20 seconds with soap and water. This is especially important after using the toilet or having a clear hand infection, before eating, and after defecating, coughing, or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends the use of a hand sanitizer with an alcohol content of at least 60% if soap and water are not available. For areas where conventional hand sanitizers are not available, the WHO has recommended two formulas for local production.
In these formulas, the antimicrobial agent is obtained from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove the microbial hagai; it is the active ingredient for hand sanitization.
Glycerol is added as a moisture-enhancing preservative.
Individuals are managed with supportive care that may include fluid-medication, oxygen support and support of other vital organs damaged.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect infection wear a simple mask.
External bronchial membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory problems but its benefits are still being investigated.
Individual hygiene and lifestyle and family dietary changes have been suggested to boost immunity.
Supportive therapies may be beneficial for people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have proposed care for people hospitalized for COVID-19.
Specialists in the special care and lung specialists in the United States have compiled treatment recommendations from various institutions into a free resource called IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
To alleviate symptoms, some medical professionals have found the use of paracetamol (astaminophen) for first-line use to be better than ibuprofen.
To reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, it is important to take precautions, especially in medical settings where suspended particle-producing procedures, such as plumbing or manual ventilation, are performed.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that individuals be kept in an AIIR (Airborne Infection Quarantine Room) and use standard precautions, contact prevention measures, and airborne precautions. The CDC has published guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Proposed equipment includes: PPE guns, respiratory masks or face masks, eye protection and surgical gloves. If available, the use of respiratory masks (instead of face masks) is preferred.
N95 respiratory masks are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks with an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The mask is designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but its efficacy against specific biological agents for consumption outside of the original application is not guaranteed.
If masks are not available, CDC recommends the use of a face shield or, as a last resort, a hand-held mask.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe as to require mechanical ventilation or alternative methods, but a percentage require these measures.
A type of respiratory support for people with COVID-19 respiratory inactivity is being studied in bedridden people. Some evidence suggests that tubing can be prevented by either a line-up of upstream flow or positive surface pressure in the airway.
Whether either of these two approaches leads to similar benefits in patients with low blood sugar is not yet clear.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation, if available, as this method limits the amount of particulate matter spread compared to the upstream-upstream nasal cannula. The prevalence of severe cases is higher in older people (persons over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age).
In many developed countries, there is insufficient hospital beds per capita. As a result, the capacity of the health system to manage the sudden increase in cases of severe COVID-19 infection requiring hospitalization is limited.
A study in China found that 5% of patients were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 infection end up in the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as COVID-19 exacerbates Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and oxygen delivery becomes more difficult.
To maximize oxygen delivery and reduce the risk of respiratory and pulmonary-related respiratory damage, it is necessary to use respiratory devices with high pressure control and PPEP.
Older household appliances may not have PEEP up.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir is apparently the most promising of the drugs.
Although the development of new drugs will take until 2021, several of the experimental drugs have already been approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Antiviral medicines may be tested in people with severe illness.
The WHO has recommended that volunteers participate in trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of potential drugs. The FDA has granted temporary authorization for the use of synthetic plasma as an experimental treatment, except in cases where the life of an individual is severely or completely at risk.
This medicine is not subject to clinical studies necessary to demonstrate disease-related efficacy and safety.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to manage the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.
Users are asked to enter their name and identification number.
The programme can identify 'closest contact' with surveillance data and detect the likelihood of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If a potential risk is identified, the program will report the issue to local health authorities in addition to providing a recommendation for home quarantine, if a potential risk is identified. Mobile phone data analysis, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence have been used to track infected and associated individuals in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the State of Israel provided security agencies with the ability to capture mobile phone data of people suspected of having COVID-19.
This was done to ensure quarantine and to protect people who may have come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom decided to make available to the Robert Koch Institute, from the German Federal Government, a collection of telephone location data to enable research into the spread and prevention of the virus.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to identify quarantine violators.
Giulio Gallera, Italy's regional health officer, was informed by mobile phone operators that 40% of people still move freely.
The German state hosted a 48-hour weekend hackathon with over 42,000 participants.
Also, Kersti Kaljulaid, President of Estonia, issued a call for creative strategies to prevent the coronavirus outbreak.
Quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection may make people feel stressed.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "Increased social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, psychological stress and economic hardship can transform people's mental and physical well-being".
The disease may be mild or asymptomatic at some stage and may develop complications similar to other common diseases affecting the upper respiratory tract, such as colds.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, but recovery in severe or acute cases may be delayed by three to six weeks.
Based on data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be at higher risk for COVID-19; however, there is little information available about COVID-19. In some individuals, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In people with dementia, COVID-19 may rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cause respiratory distress, infectious shock or multi-organ failure.
COVID-19-related side effects include infection, abnormal blood clotting and heart, kidney and liver failure.
Blood clotting abnormalities, particularly increased prothrombin time, were observed in 6% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 infection.
Signs of increased liver enzyme (transaminase) secretion have been observed in approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19.
According to the same report, the mean time between onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, with five days associated with admission to hospital.
However, in patients transferred to the ICU, a median time between admission and death of seven days has been reported.
A recent case study showed that the mean time interval between the onset of early symptoms and death was 14 days, although a full range of 6 to 41 days was reported.
Studies by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China showed that the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
Tissue-alarm examinations: Lung samples from dead individuals show diffuse pollen damage and cellular fibromycoxide secretions in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic mutations have been observed in pneumocytes.
A similar image was taken of a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, increased troponin levels or cardiac arrest were due to heart failure.
According to US March data, 89% of bedridden people have had a pre-existing illness. The accessibility of medical resources and the socio-economic situation of the region also affect the mortality rate.
Estimates of deaths from this disease are variable due to regional differences as well as cognitive difficulties.
A small number of mild cases may lead to an overestimation of the mortality rate.
Of course, the fact that deaths were the result of previous infection cases may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers, compared to nonsmokers, are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms and 2.4 times more likely to require special care or diet. Long-term consequences of this disease have been monitored.
The report, issued by the Hong Kong Hospital Administration, noted a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease and the presence of signs of trauma in the lung scan.
This condition may lead to post-convalescence special care syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not clear whether a history of infection would result in effective, long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
Immunity is tolerated based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but in some cases, the results of coronavirus testing in people who have recovered from COVID-19 have also been positive.
It is believed that these cases are due to the severity of the latent infection and not to the recurrence of the infection.
It is thought to be a natural virus of animal origin, transmitted by viral infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019 the outbreak of this infection was almost completely based on human-to-human transmission.
A review of the 41 first confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, shows that the first case of COVID-19 was reported on 1 December 2019.
The official WHO publication announced the date of the first cases of symptomatic onset on 8 December 2019.
For the analysis of mortality and mortality, different measures are usually used.
These figures vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of trials, the quality of the health system, treatment options, time since initial outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for laboratory-confirmed deaths from COVID-19 including clinical diagnosis or pandemic without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.The death rate is obtained by dividing the number of deaths by the number of diagnosed cases over a given time period.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of 17 April 2020, the global death rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
The number varies from region to region. Other screening scales may refer to the CFR, which is the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease that will kill them. The Infectious Mortality Rate (IFR) is another measure that is the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) with a disease that will kill them.
This statistic is not time-bound and follows a specific population from the infection stage to closure.
Although not all infected individuals necessarily produce antibodies, the presence of an antibody may provide information about the number of infected individuals.
In the small village of Castiglione d'Adda, a village of 4,600 people, 80 (1.7%) died in the virus outbreak in Italy.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during Carnival festivals. Infected youths led to a relatively lower mortality rate. However, some COVID-19 deaths are not officially classified as deaths from the virus.
In addition, the German health system has maintained its efficiency.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people, based on the assessment of blood donors, may have produced antibodies.
69 confirmed COVID-19 deaths (0.004% of the population) were recorded.
The impact of this pandemic and the rate of deaths differ between women and men.
In studies in China and Italy, higher mortality rates were reported in men.
The highest incidence is in men over 50 years of age. This gap between women and men is reduced by 90 years.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The reasons for this sex difference are not clear, but genetic and behavioural factors may play a role.
Sex-based immunocognition differences, lower prevalence of female smoking among women, and higher incidence of male comorbidities such as hypertension at younger ages than females may contribute to higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the US government has not taken action to collect gender-related data on COVID-19 infection.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of the treatment personnel, especially nurses, are female and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that "COVID-19" had been chosen as the official name for the disease.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO President, announced that CO is the corona strain, VI is related to the virus, D is the disease abbreviation and 19 is related to the time of its first identification: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to specific geographical locations (such as China), animal species or groups of individuals, based on international naming proposals, and with the aim of preventing labelling.The virus that causes COVID-19, coronavirus 2 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses the titles COVID-19 virus and COVID-19 virus in official communications.
The disease and the virus are collectively known as "coronavirus".
In the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the names "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus" were used together as virus and disease.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization considered 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as provisional names for the disease, based on the 2015 Guidelines on the avoidance of place names for virus and disease naming.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are moving to produce hygiene items such as nasal swabs and hearing-aid parts.
For example, in one case, an Italian hospital was in desperate need of a Hoarsann Soup machine and the supplier could not supply it on site. As a result, a local start-up required a reverse engineering measure and the production of 100 Soup per night.
After the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation and incomplete information about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease took shape and spread rapidly online.
The virus is apparently transmitted from humans to some animals.
Studies to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and poultry have not been conclusive.
No drug or vaccine has been approved to treat this disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is ongoing among governmental organizations, scientific groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a Unit Test to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the four most promising existing antiviral formulations.
There is no vaccine yet, but various agencies are actively investigating proposed vaccines.
The results of previous SARS-CoV-related studies are used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers are perfect in developing a viral vaccine.
The use of a virus, inactivated or dead, is intended to prevent the development of an immune response in the human body against a novel COVID-19 infection.
A second approach, single subunit vaccines, is being pursued, with the aim of developing a vaccine that can sensitize the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study is based on the protein spike S, which helps the virus to enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third approach involves nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, the modern method of vaccine preparation).
The experimental vaccines of each of these strategies must be evaluated for safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code that has been copied from the pathogenic virus. Pathogen-based development has been cited as a potential challenge to the development of a vaccine for SARS-COV-2, but there is debate on this.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials were underway.
Seven clinical trials evaluated treatments previously approved for the treatment of malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Antiviral medicines with modified uses are the subject of much Chinese research, with the results of a multi-country Phase III trial of remdesivir expected to be announced by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a review of the dynamics of clinical development of a COVID-19 vaccine and proposed drugs is underway.Several antiviral drugs available for the treatment of COVID-19 are under review, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, there was inconclusive evidence about the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with over-the-counter remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy. Cloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was evaluated in China in February 2020 and its preliminary results were published.
Of course, the research community has been invited to critique these results.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities have recommended the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while suggesting a daily intake of one gram, has stated that taking twice the dose is extremely dangerous and potentially fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, with the advice of physicians treating people with COVID-19.In the Virast 7 China Manual, the names interferon, ribavirin or omyfenovir were proposed for the treatment of COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high-dose ribavirin use is necessary to prevent SARS-CoV-2 replication in the laboratory.
Nitasoxanoid, after its low-concentration efficacy in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication was demonstrated, was proposed for human studies.Studies have shown that the preparation of the primary spike protein by serine transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The study of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with/without azithromycin has major limitations that have prevented the medical community from accepting these treatments without evaluation. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in the laboratory and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 has not been proven.
Cytoquin cyclones may be severely affected by the complications of the later stages of COVID-19.
Evidence suggests that hydroxychloroquine has anti-cytocin storm properties.  The National Health Commission of China included tokilizumab in the treatment manual after a brief review.
After positive results in people with severe disease, the drug was placed in a non-randomized phase 2 trial at national level in Italy.
Combination of serum serum fritin blood test with cytokine storm detection is used to counteract the development of a death-dealing disease in some infected individuals.
The FDA approved the receptor antagonist interleukin-6 based on past case studies for the treatment of cytokine-resistant release syndrome, which is induced by another cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, no randomised and controlled evidence on the efficacy of toquilizumab for the treatment of CRS has been presented.
Transmission of pure and highly-genetically-generated pathogens in the immune system of COVID-19 recovered individuals to those in need is being investigated as a non-vaccine approach with passive immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS and the results were inconclusive.
Viral neutralisation is a potential mechanism of action that provides a defensive field against SARS-CoV-2 based on an inert antibody-drug basis.
However, other mechanisms, such as cytotoxicity of pathogen-dependent cytokines and/or phagocytosis, may be effective.
Other types of passive antitheractics, such as the use of synthetic monoclonal antibodies, are under investigation.
The production of synthetic serum, which includes the blood-liquid portion taken from recovered individuals and contains specific antibodies to the virus, may be increased for faster development.
Diseases caused by coronavirus, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a physician at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later died from COVID-19 after public awareness of the virus outbreak.
